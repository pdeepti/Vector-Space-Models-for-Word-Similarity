finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari teammates , rubens barrichello -lrb- right -rrb- and michael schumacher celebrate on the podium after the grand prix of san marino at imola racetrack , sunday , april 14 , 2002 .
a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher has won four consecutive formula one titles with ferrari .
schumi ’ s race to the title but the not yet six-time champion refused to rely on help from his colleague .
" you never know , what ’ s going on up front .
i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .
" i locked up so tight when ralf hit me that i was almost losing vision on the straights the vibrations were so huge , " a dazed michael recalled after the race .
but the brothers quickly regained control of their machines and raced to the finish line .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .

in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .

still giddy from their semifinal victory over world cup favorites the united states , the german women 's soccer team is gearing up to face sweden in their first world cup final in eight years . no matter what happens when the women 's national team takes on sweden in the world cup final in the u.s. this sunday , the german women are guaranteed a party . the city of frankfurt announced thursday that the römerplatz , where the men 's national soccer team celebrated a raucous homecoming after their second place showing in the 2002 world cup , would be made available for the women as well . the honor is a sign of the excitement beginning to spread in germany for the upcoming game . " our new football darlings : they 've already played themselves into our hearts , on sunday they could write themselves into the history books with their first world cup championship , " wrote the mass daily bild this week . skipping the men 's game for the women 's the head of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- gerhard mayer-vorfelder decided to skip an important european cup qualifying match for the men 's team on saturday and will instead fly to carson , california , to watch the women live . men 's team coach rudi völler sent a congratulatory letter to his female counterpart tina theune-mayer .
" i hope you do it better on sunday than we did a year ago , " said völler , referring to his team 's 2-0 loss in the world cup final to brazil . the quality of this year 's world cup has opened many eyes , chief among them fifa president joseph blatter .
blatter said he was " pleasantly surprised " by the level of play he saw in the women 's matches and said fifa should consider awarding financial bonuses to the winners , like they do for the men 's world cup . " we should look into that , " blatter said .
" if we want to give women the same attention , then we need to also think about bonuses . " another bonus the dfb is considering would be more obvious to the fans of women 's soccer .
if the women win the title on sunday , dfb president mayer-vorfelder said they should get their own jersey with one star .
up to now the female eleven have been donning the men 's uniforms with three stars for three world cups . prinz now german soccer royalty newspapers are devoting more ink than in recent memory to the women 's national team .
major weeklies and television stations have done profiles on top women 's players , including international star birgit prinz .
the striker , runner up to mia hamm in fifa female soccer player of the year voting this year , has tallied seven goals in the world cup so far .
the number ensures her the goal-scorer 's title and solidifies her standing as one of the best women 's players around . " i 'm honored , but in the end the team is what 's important , " said prinz .
" it does n't matter at all , which of us shoots the goals .
what makes us stand out is that we work as a team . " favorable final matchup their teamwork and a fluid passing game stymied the hometown favorite u.s. women 's team , the world cup defending champions , last sunday .
continuous charges towards the german goal were regularly blocked by goalie silke rottenberg , and the german women countered with a fluid short passing game . they scored a goal in the 15th minute with a head shot from prinz , then added two more after regulation time expired . going into the final against sweden on sunday , the german team stands a good chance of coming out on top .
in the match-ups it has had with sweden so far , the germans have performed well .
the last major game against the swedes was the european cup in 2001 .
germany dispatched sweden 3-1 in the opening match and then beat them 1-0 to win the final . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany stuns u.s. , heads to women 's world cup final germany faces sweden in the women 's world cup final after beating the favored u.s. squad 3-0 on sunday .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .

he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .

but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari teammates , rubens barrichello -lrb- right -rrb- and michael schumacher celebrate on the podium after the grand prix of san marino at imola racetrack , sunday , april 14 , 2002 .
a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher has won four consecutive formula one titles with ferrari .
schumi ’ s race to the title but the not yet six-time champion refused to rely on help from his colleague .
" you never know , what ’ s going on up front .
i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .
" i locked up so tight when ralf hit me that i was almost losing vision on the straights the vibrations were so huge , " a dazed michael recalled after the race .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari teammates , rubens barrichello -lrb- right -rrb- and michael schumacher celebrate on the podium after the grand prix of san marino at imola racetrack , sunday , april 14 , 2002 .
a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher has won four consecutive formula one titles with ferrari .
schumi ’ s race to the title but the not yet six-time champion refused to rely on help from his colleague .
" you never know , what ’ s going on up front .
i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .
" i locked up so tight when ralf hit me that i was almost losing vision on the straights the vibrations were so huge , " a dazed michael recalled after the race .
but the brothers quickly regained control of their machines and raced to the finish line .
fueled by determination , michael pressed forward until after 53 laps along the 5.8 kilometer track , he safely crossed the finish in eighth place and rolled into the annals of racing history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

schumi ’ s race to the title but the not yet six-time champion refused to rely on help from his colleague .
" you never know , what ’ s going on up front .
i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .
" i locked up so tight when ralf hit me that i was almost losing vision on the straights the vibrations were so huge , " a dazed michael recalled after the race .
but the brothers quickly regained control of their machines and raced to the finish line .
fueled by determination , michael pressed forward until after 53 laps along the 5.8 kilometer track , he safely crossed the finish in eighth place and rolled into the annals of racing history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .

but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .

" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .

the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .

still giddy from their semifinal victory over world cup favorites the united states , the german women 's soccer team is gearing up to face sweden in their first world cup final in eight years . no matter what happens when the women 's national team takes on sweden in the world cup final in the u.s. this sunday , the german women are guaranteed a party . the city of frankfurt announced thursday that the römerplatz , where the men 's national soccer team celebrated a raucous homecoming after their second place showing in the 2002 world cup , would be made available for the women as well . the honor is a sign of the excitement beginning to spread in germany for the upcoming game . " our new football darlings : they 've already played themselves into our hearts , on sunday they could write themselves into the history books with their first world cup championship , " wrote the mass daily bild this week . skipping the men 's game for the women 's the head of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- gerhard mayer-vorfelder decided to skip an important european cup qualifying match for the men 's team on saturday and will instead fly to carson , california , to watch the women live . men 's team coach rudi völler sent a congratulatory letter to his female counterpart tina theune-mayer .
" i hope you do it better on sunday than we did a year ago , " said völler , referring to his team 's 2-0 loss in the world cup final to brazil . the quality of this year 's world cup has opened many eyes , chief among them fifa president joseph blatter .
blatter said he was " pleasantly surprised " by the level of play he saw in the women 's matches and said fifa should consider awarding financial bonuses to the winners , like they do for the men 's world cup . " we should look into that , " blatter said .
" if we want to give women the same attention , then we need to also think about bonuses . " another bonus the dfb is considering would be more obvious to the fans of women 's soccer .
if the women win the title on sunday , dfb president mayer-vorfelder said they should get their own jersey with one star .
up to now the female eleven have been donning the men 's uniforms with three stars for three world cups . prinz now german soccer royalty newspapers are devoting more ink than in recent memory to the women 's national team .
major weeklies and television stations have done profiles on top women 's players , including international star birgit prinz .
the striker , runner up to mia hamm in fifa female soccer player of the year voting this year , has tallied seven goals in the world cup so far .
the number ensures her the goal-scorer 's title and solidifies her standing as one of the best women 's players around . " i 'm honored , but in the end the team is what 's important , " said prinz .
" it does n't matter at all , which of us shoots the goals .
what makes us stand out is that we work as a team . " favorable final matchup their teamwork and a fluid passing game stymied the hometown favorite u.s. women 's team , the world cup defending champions , last sunday .
continuous charges towards the german goal were regularly blocked by goalie silke rottenberg , and the german women countered with a fluid short passing game . they scored a goal in the 15th minute with a head shot from prinz , then added two more after regulation time expired . going into the final against sweden on sunday , the german team stands a good chance of coming out on top .

early sunday morning formula one fans in germany woke to see their home favorite , michael schumacher , beat out his stiffest rival kimi raikkonen to claim a historic sixth world championship in suzuka , japan . just one point short of the ultimate victory , schumacher only needed an eighth place finish in suzuka to secure the world racing championship , but a box stop in the sixth lap almost put this year ’ s title out of reach for the world ’ s best formula one driver on sunday .
with kimi raikkonen from finland racing hard to score a first place finish in japan and snatch the historic crown away from " schumi , " the last race of the season was one of the most dramatic in a turbulent season .
unlike in 2002 , when the german champ wrapped up the title halfway through the season , this year the five-time title holder had to fight a tough battle against rivals raikkonen from mclaren-mercedes and juan pablo montoya from bmw-williams .
" it has been a tough year , a tough late stage of the season and a very tough race , one of my toughest ever , " an obviously relieved schumacher said after crossing the finish line further down in the ranking than usual .
he added , " most of my championships have been secured with a win on the track .
today i did it with eighth place which gives me mixed emotions . "
the ferrari driver is now the only racer to hold six world championship titles -lrb- 1994 , 1995 , 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 -rrb- and has surpassed the record of the argentinian legend juan manuel fangio , who won five consecutive titles in the 1950s .

a little help from a teammate but schumi wouldn ’ t have been crowned champion on sunday if it hadn ’ t been for brazilian teammate rubens barrichello , who kept second-place raikkonen at bay by winning the japanese grand prix .
raikkonen , who was two points away from the lead , needed a track victory to have any hope of stealing schumi ’ s crown .
but despite heading the pack early in the rounds , the finish driver couldn ’ t outrace barrichello , whose triumph on sunday put him in fourth place for the season and helped ferrari celebrate in style with its fifth consecutive constructors ’ title .
but for schumacher , who started out in 14th position , the suzuka race didn ’ t go so smoothly .
after quickly advancing to 12th place in the initial laps , the german star collided with the bar-honda driven by takuma sato in the sixth lap and knocked the front wing off his ferrari .
he dove into the pits where his team changed the nose cone in 18.1 seconds , but the incident dropped schumacher down to last place .
by lap 17 , with the first round of pit stops completed , barrichello led the pack .
michael schumacher was in 13th place .
one lap later raikkonen began inching forward and finally took up the lead .
but by lap 26 barrichello was again leading and widened the margin by 10 seconds in lap 30 .
he kept his front position through the rest of the race , guaranteeing an almost certain title for schumacher as long as he came in no lower than eighth .

" you never know , what ’ s going on up front .
i just knew i had to focus on myself , " he said .
and schumi fought to gain back his standing .
ahead of his second pit stop , schumi had progressed to 11th place and was three quarters of a minute behind his race-leading teammate , with the gap narrowing .
then on lap 41 schumacher was almost shunted out by his younger brother ralf , who was following close on the wheels of michael when he hit the back tire of the ferrari .
" i locked up so tight when ralf hit me that i was almost losing vision on the straights the vibrations were so huge , " a dazed michael recalled after the race .

finance minister hans eichel has admitted that this year 's debt could be drastically higher than expected – close to 42 billion euros .
that ’ s more than double earlier forecasts and could lead to serious consequences . germany ’ s finance minister was in the hot seat again this weekend .
the man who took office promising to balance the budget now finds himself struggling to explain why the country ’ s deficit continues to rise .
on saturday hans eichel admitted borrowing for 2003 could amount to as much as 42 billion euros .
" up until now i ’ ve assumed the deficit would be approximately double the earmarked amount of 18.9 billion euro , " he said in berlin .
but now it looks like the mountain of debt will grow even more , according to german public broadcaster zdf .
the television station has reported that finance ministry sources are pinpointing the amount at close to 41.9 billion .
if that ’ s the case , the debt accumulated under the current social democrat administration of chancellor gerhard schröder would surpass the previous record of 40 billion reached back in 1996 under former chancellor helmut kohl of the conservative christian democrats union .
eichel explained the larger than predicted deficit was the result of the stagnating economy .
he blamed the poor economy for whittling away at tax revenue while at the same time gobbling up increased expenditures to compensate for the massive unemployment benefits .
breaking with budget discipline eichel also admitted that if germany ’ s debt is as high as feared , the country ’ s deficit will exceed four percent of gross domestic product , well over the three percent limit set in the stability and growth pact for the common currency euro zone .
this would then be germany ’ s third violation and the country could risk hefty fines from the eu .
according to the news magazine focus , the eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes is forecasting a clear violation of the deficit guidelines .
his report , which is due on oct .
29 , will reportedly show that germany ’ s deficit for 2003 exceeds even five percent of the country ’ s gdp .
in addition , both the european union and the international monetary fund are predicting a zero-percent growth rate for this year in germany , meaning that an immediate reduction in the deficit is not in the near future .
in 2004 growth will only recover by a slight two percent .
calls for resignation criticism for germany ’ s obvious violation of budgetary discipline is not only coming from brussels .
opposition party politicians in berlin are calling for eichel ’ s resignation .
the neo-liberal free democrat party have accused the finance minister of failing to keep a closer eye on the budget .
the next generation will have to pay the price for such oversight in higher taxes , said the fdp finance expert jürgen koppelin .
" the savings commissioner has turned into the debt accumulator of the nation , " the politicians said in berlin on saturday .
friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s parliamentary party deputy , was also quick to criticize eichel .
if germany does overstep the stability pact by such a gross amount , than it would be one of the " trailbllazers in the eu for violating the terms of the maastricht treaty .
that would destroy one of the joint legal frameworks which we agreed to in order to stabilize our currency , " merz said .
but the majority of the german people don ’ t seem to be quite as alarmed about the deficit as the politicians themselves .
a survey conducted by the polling institute infratest for the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday showed that 49 percent of those questioned were against eichel ’ s resignation , compared to 45 percent in favor .
whether that slim favorability rate is enough to keep germany 's über-accountant out of the hot seat in the long run remains to be seen .
at the end of the month the finance ministry will announce its final figures for the revised budget and growth prognosis for this year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris and berlin contend with deficit woes budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continues , as eu officials criticize france over its deficit and germany appears set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year -lrb- oct .

forty-five supporters were deported from the city 's ataturk airport on saturday , including many who were held overnight by turkish authorities .

after the match , police made sure there was no trouble in the pubs and cafes in the busy tourist area of taksim square .
david swift , head of the english policing team in istanbul , said of those deported : " they have not been guilty of any criminal behaviour , it is just that the government and police service here adopted the approach where they refused them access . "

ten people have died and dozens injured in three weeks of anti-government protests led by trade unions and coca growers .
they are against plans to build a pipeline to carry natural gas to the pacific ocean through chile and are also demanding the resignation of president gonzalo sanchez de lozada .
bolivia is suffering increasing food and oil shortages because protesters have blocked key roads across the country .
witnesses said saturday 's clashes in el alto - suffering its second day of violence - broke out after police and soldiers tried to disperse crowds of looters .
hospitalised a court prosecutor , jimmy pareja , was quoted by associated press as saying a police officer was killed by protesters .
witnesses told local radio a young boy was killed , and hospital officials said a man brought in with a gunshot wound to the head was not expected to survive .
the city - with a population of 750,000 - has been nearly shut down by the strikes .
government officials propose constructing a pipeline to export natural gas , which they say would generate $ 1.5bn for what is south america 's poorest nation .
but demonstrators are angry at plans to ship it out via chile , which took bolivia 's only access to the sea in a war more than a century ago .
they also say laws governing the export of natural gas should be changed to ensure more of the profits stay in the country .

but in the united states staff and students at virginia tech have built one of the world 's most powerful supercomputers for just $ 5m by plugging together hundreds of the latest computers from apple .
the project involved placing 1,100 brand new apple g5 towers side by side , making it the world 's most powerful " homebuilt " system .
it is capable of 17.6 trillion floating point operations per second , with a combined storage capacity of 176 terabytes .
" each individual g5 is a dual processor , 2ghz machine with 4gb of memory .
so it 's extremely fast , " said pat arvin , project coordinator at virginia tech .
the network is linked using 2,900 cables and runs at about 100 times faster than an average corporate network .
but the hard part of making a supercomputer is stability .
the project 's chief architect , srinidhi varadarajan , had to write a special program called deja vu to ensure that if an individual computer crashed in the middle of a calculation lasting weeks , if not months , another computer would take over seamlessly .
" this is pretty much like open heart surgery because you 're working on a computer and moving an application while it still continues to run , " said dr varadarajan " you can not stop the program , actually , and that 's the speciality of this system . "
heat and water the supercomputer , unofficially nicknamed big mac , was built in just three months .
right from the start there were major hurdles that could only be overcome with significant construction in and around the building .
running 1,100 computers in a 3,000-square-foot -lrb- 280-sq-metres -rrb- area sends the air temperature well over 100 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 38 celsius -rrb- .
the heat is so intense that ordinary air conditioning units would have resulted in 60-mph -lrb- 95 km / h -rrb- winds .
specialised heat exchange cooling units were built that pipe chilled water into the facility .
" there are two chillers for this project , " explained kevin shinpaugh , director of cluster computing .
" they 're rated 125 tonnes each in cooling capacity , and they pump 750 gallons per minute each .
the water is at about 45 degrees fahrenheit . "
the power supply was another huge challenge .
the supercomputer uses the same amount of electricity as 3,000 average sized homes .
big science in early september , the g5s started arriving by the lorry load and technicians rushed to install the hundreds of computers .
" we did 238 machines in little under two hours , so we were humming along as an assembly line , " said jason lockhart , director of high performance computing .
a speedy installation was essential because virginia tech had to comply with an october deadline set by the national science foundation .
missing that deadline would have meant automatic disqualification from the nsf 's global supercomputer rankings , thereby denying the college any chance of competing for top scientific research projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year .
" a system of this size generally sees its best application in what is known as big science research ; massive simulations , models , computational engineering systems , " said dr varadarajan .
" examples of these include things like nanoscale electronics ; if you 're trying to invent computer chips 30 years from now you 're looking at atomic levels with a single atom acting as a switch . "
arguably virginia tech has revolutionised the world of supercomputing with a simplistic setup that can be duplicated around the globe by other institutions .
it has documented how it did this from start to finish so if others want to follow suit , they can send off for a kit that tells them how to do it .

more than 1,000 g5s have been linked up but in the united states staff and students at virginia tech have built one of the world 's most powerful supercomputers for just $ 5m by plugging together hundreds of the latest computers from apple .
the project involved placing 1,100 brand new apple g5 towers side by side , making it the world 's most powerful " homebuilt " system .
it is capable of 17.6 trillion floating point operations per second , with a combined storage capacity of 176 terabytes .
" each individual g5 is a dual processor , 2ghz machine with 4gb of memory .
so it 's extremely fast , " said pat arvin , project coordinator at virginia tech .
the network is linked using 2,900 cables and runs at about 100 times faster than an average corporate network .
but the hard part of making a supercomputer is stability .
the project 's chief architect , srinidhi varadarajan , had to write a special program called deja vu to ensure that if an individual computer crashed in the middle of a calculation lasting weeks , if not months , another computer would take over seamlessly .
" this is pretty much like open heart surgery because you 're working on a computer and moving an application while it still continues to run , " said dr varadarajan " you can not stop the program , actually , and that 's the speciality of this system . "
heat and water the supercomputer , unofficially nicknamed big mac , was built in just three months .
chilled water is piped into the facility right from the start there were major hurdles that could only be overcome with significant construction in and around the building .
running 1,100 computers in a 3,000-square-foot -lrb- 280-sq-metres -rrb- area sends the air temperature well over 100 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 38 celsius -rrb- .
the heat is so intense that ordinary air conditioning units would have resulted in 60-mph -lrb- 95 km / h -rrb- winds .
specialised heat exchange cooling units were built that pipe chilled water into the facility .
" there are two chillers for this project , " explained kevin shinpaugh , director of cluster computing .
" they 're rated 125 tonnes each in cooling capacity , and they pump 750 gallons per minute each .
the water is at about 45 degrees fahrenheit . "
the power supply was another huge challenge .
the supercomputer uses the same amount of electricity as 3,000 average sized homes .
big science in early september , the g5s started arriving by the lorry load and technicians rushed to install the hundreds of computers .
technicians had to quickly install the machines " we did 238 machines in little under two hours , so we were humming along as an assembly line , " said jason lockhart , director of high performance computing .
a speedy installation was essential because virginia tech had to comply with an october deadline set by the national science foundation .
missing that deadline would have meant automatic disqualification from the nsf 's global supercomputer rankings , thereby denying the college any chance of competing for top scientific research projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year .

a speedy installation was essential because virginia tech had to comply with an october deadline set by the national science foundation .
missing that deadline would have meant automatic disqualification from the nsf 's global supercomputer rankings , thereby denying the college any chance of competing for top scientific research projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year .
" a system of this size generally sees its best application in what is known as big science research ; massive simulations , models , computational engineering systems , " said dr varadarajan .
" examples of these include things like nanoscale electronics ; if you 're trying to invent computer chips 30 years from now you 're looking at atomic levels with a single atom acting as a switch . "
arguably virginia tech has revolutionised the world of supercomputing with a simplistic setup that can be duplicated around the globe by other institutions .
it has documented how it did this from start to finish so if others want to follow suit , they can send off for a kit that tells them how to do it .

amitabh bachchan relaunched his film company , ab corporation someone had already warned me that the legend of indian cinema always started his parties on time .
we were fashionably late , but turned up to face a star-studded array of celebrities that would make most bollywood fans green with envy .
it was a party that everyone - all the actors , politicians , industrialists and media who mattered - had clearly made the effort to come to .
this was a bombay mix of money , glamour and politics .
big business players like the hinduja brothers rubbed shoulders with cinema giants hemma malini and dilip kumar .
the award-winning actress tabu and up-and-coming star fardeen khan were among those paying homage to the man who 's face still lights up billboards across bombay , also known as mumbai .
the 61-year-old will star with son abhishek in ranveer bachchan 's speech was relayed across two giant screens flanking the stage .
he told his captive audience of 1,000 guests that this was not a birthday bash - but the launch of his film and his company .
he told the bbc : " this is not a celebration .
i lost my father earlier on so we do n't celebrate for a year .
" this is an inspiration to what he has left behind .
his strength , his will power , his faith in doing things correctly and doing things with confidence .
i hope i am able to live up to his aspirations . "
his film company , ab corporation , which he is slowly re-building , will co-produce the first movie to star bachchan and son abhishek , he announced .
in ranveer the warrior , they will play father and son and the film promises to delight and intrigue fans as the clash of relationships and ideals between the two actors unfolds .
about 1,000 people attended the party last year , the company went bankrupt and had to shut down after making huge financial losses .
but the message to his fans , who were able to watch the coverage live , was one of thanks for all the greetings and support .
and the highlight of my first bollywood bash was the one shot any admirer of amitabh would cherish and the snappers captured .
a reunion of three veteran actors , vinod khanna , rishi kapoor and bachchan , who starred in the enduring movie of three men from three different religions , amar akhbar anthony .
that was a pretty impressive way to end a party .
