the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .
whether that offer will be accepted or not , he said , depended on the u.s.-led coalition now in charge in iraq .

large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home . engineering trade union ig metall has been fighting to cut working hours in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours a week , bringing practices in line with those in western germany .
the union says the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers contend shortening the eastern week to match the west would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . as the strikes entered their fourth week , some western car plants on monday were forced to halt assembly lines as eastern parts makers failed to make key deliveries .
bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .
they contend that eastern productivity still lags behind the west and that companies will be less likely to invest in eastern germany if the week is shortened , since wage costs will increase . “ it has a negative effect in a massive way on the east german labor market , ” wolfgang wiegard , an economic advisor to the government , told zdf television .
“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .
bmw is currently building a plant in saxony near leipzig that , when completed , will employ around 5,000 people . ig metall has given employers an ultimatum to return to the negotiating table by wednesday , or the union will expand the strikes to other plants . over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schröder appealed to both sides to come together .
“ it would be better if there were an agreement an hour too soon instead of an hour too late .
i ’ m counting on both sides to be reasonable and end this as soon as possible , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "
it seems that a contributing factor to the new amendments was an action brought by a local opposition party in belgium against foreign minister luis michel , citing his involvement in an arms deal to nepal .
the legislation was hurriedly prepared soon after .
law used by the politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law was first used in war crimes cases in rwanda .
as it stands , the unique 1993 law allows charges to be brought to a belgian court regardless of where the war crimes took place .
first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures .
the highest profile case to date under the original law was an action brought against israeli leader ariel sharon by survivors of a 1982 massacre of palestinian refugees in lebanon by lebanese christian militiamen .
the case provoked outrage in israel and has been suspended given sharon 's immunity .
but even before rumsfeld 's threat to boycott all nato meetings on june 12 , the belgian government had introduced a first set of changes to the legislation to allow the authorities to block cases brought against citizens from countries judged to have fair legal systems .
amendments limit law to belgians the latest amendments would reduce the law 's global reach , limiting the power of belgian courts to cases with a direct link to the country , such as when victims or suspects are belgian citizens or residents .
it is intended to make it harder for foreigners to initiate proceedings under the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thumbs up from belgium 's foreign minister louis michel .
it was unclear whether the changes had placated washington , as there was no official comment from the white house .
belgian officials are confident , however , that the new changes should satisfy u.s. concerns .
foreign minister michel said the changes would end " rash and annoying complaints that wrongly target figures from partner countries . "
the new amendments are likely to be approved by parliament , where the governing liberal and socialist parties have a majority and the main opposition party has proposed similar changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld 's nato comments smoothed over outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home . engineering trade union ig metall has been fighting to cut working hours in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours a week , bringing practices in line with those in western germany .
the union says the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers contend shortening the eastern week to match the west would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . as the strikes entered their fourth week , some western car plants on monday were forced to halt assembly lines as eastern parts makers failed to make key deliveries .
bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

whether that offer will be accepted or not , he said , depended on the u.s.-led coalition now in charge in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 belgium to amend controversial war crimes law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister verhofstadt insists the new changes have nothing to do with u.s. pressure amid the furore that followed a spate of legal cases brought against prominent western figures since the end of the iraq war , the belgian government has decided to water down its controversial war crimes law . with international pressure growing , the belgian government announced sunday it would be amending its controversial war crimes law for the second time this year , limiting its application to citizens and residents of belgium .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "
it seems that a contributing factor to the new amendments was an action brought by a local opposition party in belgium against foreign minister luis michel , citing his involvement in an arms deal to nepal .
the legislation was hurriedly prepared soon after .
law used by the politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law was first used in war crimes cases in rwanda .
as it stands , the unique 1993 law allows charges to be brought to a belgian court regardless of where the war crimes took place .
first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures .
the highest profile case to date under the original law was an action brought against israeli leader ariel sharon by survivors of a 1982 massacre of palestinian refugees in lebanon by lebanese christian militiamen .
the case provoked outrage in israel and has been suspended given sharon 's immunity .
but even before rumsfeld 's threat to boycott all nato meetings on june 12 , the belgian government had introduced a first set of changes to the legislation to allow the authorities to block cases brought against citizens from countries judged to have fair legal systems .
amendments limit law to belgians the latest amendments would reduce the law 's global reach , limiting the power of belgian courts to cases with a direct link to the country , such as when victims or suspects are belgian citizens or residents .
it is intended to make it harder for foreigners to initiate proceedings under the legislation .

it was unclear whether the changes had placated washington , as there was no official comment from the white house .
belgian officials are confident , however , that the new changes should satisfy u.s. concerns .
foreign minister michel said the changes would end " rash and annoying complaints that wrongly target figures from partner countries . "
the new amendments are likely to be approved by parliament , where the governing liberal and socialist parties have a majority and the main opposition party has proposed similar changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld 's nato comments smoothed over outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 belgium to amend controversial war crimes law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister verhofstadt insists the new changes have nothing to do with u.s. pressure amid the furore that followed a spate of legal cases brought against prominent western figures since the end of the iraq war , the belgian government has decided to water down its controversial war crimes law . with international pressure growing , the belgian government announced sunday it would be amending its controversial war crimes law for the second time this year , limiting its application to citizens and residents of belgium .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "
it seems that a contributing factor to the new amendments was an action brought by a local opposition party in belgium against foreign minister luis michel , citing his involvement in an arms deal to nepal .
the legislation was hurriedly prepared soon after .
law used by the politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law was first used in war crimes cases in rwanda .
as it stands , the unique 1993 law allows charges to be brought to a belgian court regardless of where the war crimes took place .
first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures .
the highest profile case to date under the original law was an action brought against israeli leader ariel sharon by survivors of a 1982 massacre of palestinian refugees in lebanon by lebanese christian militiamen .
the case provoked outrage in israel and has been suspended given sharon 's immunity .
but even before rumsfeld 's threat to boycott all nato meetings on june 12 , the belgian government had introduced a first set of changes to the legislation to allow the authorities to block cases brought against citizens from countries judged to have fair legal systems .
amendments limit law to belgians the latest amendments would reduce the law 's global reach , limiting the power of belgian courts to cases with a direct link to the country , such as when victims or suspects are belgian citizens or residents .
it is intended to make it harder for foreigners to initiate proceedings under the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thumbs up from belgium 's foreign minister louis michel .
it was unclear whether the changes had placated washington , as there was no official comment from the white house .
belgian officials are confident , however , that the new changes should satisfy u.s. concerns .
foreign minister michel said the changes would end " rash and annoying complaints that wrongly target figures from partner countries . "
the new amendments are likely to be approved by parliament , where the governing liberal and socialist parties have a majority and the main opposition party has proposed similar changes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld 's nato comments smoothed over outspoken u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said nato 's brussels headquarters could be moved if belgium war crimes law is n't changed .
the country 's foreign minister says enough has already been done .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .

former champion boris becker is back in his commentating job with the bbc . the wimbledon tennis championships open at the all england club in london sw19 on monday and experts believe that it is one of the most wide-open fields for many years , with any number of hopefuls capable of holding the trophies aloft come the final day .
while the memory remains crowded with images of the all-conquering pete sampras ' seven victories , andre agassi 's showmanship , a teenage boris becker making history and epics featuring goran ivanisevic and pat rafter , there is a breed of young guns waiting to add their names to legend in the men 's championship .
at the start of proceedings , stella artois champ , andy roddick and the ever-hopeful home crowd 's sweetheart tim henman will be looking to emulate the greats who have lobbed , smashed and tumbled their way to greatness on the hallowed turf of the center court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serena williams .
in the ladies contest , the powerful williams sisters ' strangle hold on the coveted singles shield will face some serious prizing attempts from current in-form belgians kim clijsters and justine henin-hardenne .
if that was n't competition enough , there 's a whole queue of possible champions waiting to snatch the glory away from serena and venus .
two-time wimbledon semi-finalist jennifer capriati is hoping to go one further this year as her comeback continues while fellow american lindsay davenport returns from injury .
any german contenders ?
australians , americans , brits , russians ... it 's an international affair at wimbledon .
but if there is one conspicuous absence from the list of nations pushing a potential winner , it 's the former tennis superpower – germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the good old days .
germany .
the home of seven times ladies champ steffi graf and three time winner of the men 's singles boris becker .
there was a time when no grand slam tournament was safe from the big serve of boris and the nifty footwork of the super-agile steffi .
wimbledon was almost a second home for these two .
but it has been over 12 years since a german faced the final hurdle in the men 's singles tournament at the all england club and that was the double-header between michael stich and becker .
the last german appearance in a final at wimbledon was graf 's defeat to lindsay davenport in 1999 .
however , one german has already won big at wimbledon 2003 .
boris becker is back at wimbledon this year to cast his expert eye over the championships for the bbc .
germany 's most successful male competitor has landed a second contract with the broadcaster to pass his experienced judgement over the two-week period of play after his words of wisdom proved popular last year .
he 's joined on the team of analytical ex-pros by john mcenroe , pat cash and virginia wade amongst others .
experience speaks volumes record breaking becker 's opinion should be taken as gospel when it comes to wimbledon .
not only was he the youngest player ever to win the tournament , " boom boom " boris was also the first unseeded player to become champion and the first german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending champion lleyton hewitt .
so surely , seven-time finalist becker , the man with experience of both the championship and the up and coming breed of german stars , has high hopes for his countrymen and women : " roger federer of switzerland is one of the top four favorites i would consider to win wimbledon , along with lleyton hewitt -lrb- right -rrb- , the young croatian mario ancic and andy roddick . "
unfortunately , becker 's top four was cut down to three when reigning champion lleyton hewitt crashed out in the first round to unfancied croat ivo karlovic in an unprecedented exit for the holder of the men 's title .
with big guns falling , any chance of seeing the singles title going to nic kiefer , australian open runner-up rainer schuettler or lars burgsmuller , boris ?
" tim henman 's chance this year is as good as any .
you only have three or four really good grass court players and he is one of them .
he has a great record at wimbledon and his draw is n't so bad . "
we 'll take that as an answer in the negative then .
little or no chance ?
this year , there are 23 german players starting at wimbledon .
four of them – alex waske , rainer schuettler , anca barna and tomas behrend – begin their challenges on the opening day .
the same experts who say that anyone can win this year 's title fail to mention any of the german players in their first few breaths .
hardly encouraging is the fact that even boris becker can not muster an enthusiastic comment about a german 's chance at lifting a trophy this summer in sw19 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yearning for the golden age of german tennis recent early exits from major tournaments have compounded the frustration of germany 's latest crop of tennis players .

bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .

“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .

bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .
they contend that eastern productivity still lags behind the west and that companies will be less likely to invest in eastern germany if the week is shortened , since wage costs will increase . “ it has a negative effect in a massive way on the east german labor market , ” wolfgang wiegard , an economic advisor to the government , told zdf television .
“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .
bmw is currently building a plant in saxony near leipzig that , when completed , will employ around 5,000 people . ig metall has given employers an ultimatum to return to the negotiating table by wednesday , or the union will expand the strikes to other plants . over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schröder appealed to both sides to come together .
“ it would be better if there were an agreement an hour too soon instead of an hour too late .
i ’ m counting on both sides to be reasonable and end this as soon as possible , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home . engineering trade union ig metall has been fighting to cut working hours in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours a week , bringing practices in line with those in western germany .
the union says the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers contend shortening the eastern week to match the west would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . as the strikes entered their fourth week , some western car plants on monday were forced to halt assembly lines as eastern parts makers failed to make key deliveries .
bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .
they contend that eastern productivity still lags behind the west and that companies will be less likely to invest in eastern germany if the week is shortened , since wage costs will increase . “ it has a negative effect in a massive way on the east german labor market , ” wolfgang wiegard , an economic advisor to the government , told zdf television .
“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .
bmw is currently building a plant in saxony near leipzig that , when completed , will employ around 5,000 people . ig metall has given employers an ultimatum to return to the negotiating table by wednesday , or the union will expand the strikes to other plants . over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schröder appealed to both sides to come together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , right , welcomes german foreign minister joschka fischer in beirut , lebanon .
the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell , jordanian king abdullah ii , qatari foreign minister hamed bin jassim , and jordanian prime minister ali abu-al-ragheb , from left , look on during a meeting between powell with arab foreign ministers participating in the world economic forum in the jordanian dead sea resort town of southern shuneh .
-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .

large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home . engineering trade union ig metall has been fighting to cut working hours in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours a week , bringing practices in line with those in western germany .
the union says the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers contend shortening the eastern week to match the west would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . as the strikes entered their fourth week , some western car plants on monday were forced to halt assembly lines as eastern parts makers failed to make key deliveries .
bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .
they contend that eastern productivity still lags behind the west and that companies will be less likely to invest in eastern germany if the week is shortened , since wage costs will increase . “ it has a negative effect in a massive way on the east german labor market , ” wolfgang wiegard , an economic advisor to the government , told zdf television .
“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .
bmw is currently building a plant in saxony near leipzig that , when completed , will employ around 5,000 people . ig metall has given employers an ultimatum to return to the negotiating table by wednesday , or the union will expand the strikes to other plants . over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schröder appealed to both sides to come together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , right , welcomes german foreign minister joschka fischer in beirut , lebanon .
the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell , jordanian king abdullah ii , qatari foreign minister hamed bin jassim , and jordanian prime minister ali abu-al-ragheb , from left , look on during a meeting between powell with arab foreign ministers participating in the world economic forum in the jordanian dead sea resort town of southern shuneh .
-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , right , welcomes german foreign minister joschka fischer in beirut , lebanon .
the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .
whether that offer will be accepted or not , he said , depended on the u.s.-led coalition now in charge in iraq .

belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "
it seems that a contributing factor to the new amendments was an action brought by a local opposition party in belgium against foreign minister luis michel , citing his involvement in an arms deal to nepal .
the legislation was hurriedly prepared soon after .

the highest profile case to date under the original law was an action brought against israeli leader ariel sharon by survivors of a 1982 massacre of palestinian refugees in lebanon by lebanese christian militiamen .
the case provoked outrage in israel and has been suspended given sharon 's immunity .
but even before rumsfeld 's threat to boycott all nato meetings on june 12 , the belgian government had introduced a first set of changes to the legislation to allow the authorities to block cases brought against citizens from countries judged to have fair legal systems .

large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home . engineering trade union ig metall has been fighting to cut working hours in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours a week , bringing practices in line with those in western germany .
the union says the difference creates a “ fairness gap ” , but employers contend shortening the eastern week to match the west would endanger thousands of jobs in the former communist east . as the strikes entered their fourth week , some western car plants on monday were forced to halt assembly lines as eastern parts makers failed to make key deliveries .
bmw closed its 3-series production lines in regensburg and munich plants indefinitely , affecting 10,000 western workers . a spokesman for germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen said on monday if the eastern strikes continued , the company would likely have to halt production of some models at its flagship plant in wolfsburg this friday . ig metall ’ s designated chairman jürgen peters on monday said the union was willing to compromise on the implementation of the shorter work week , so long as employers would return to the negotiating table . “ we always said it wouldn ’ t have to happen overnight .
we want it to happen in steps that takes into account the differences of each company , ” peters told deutschlandfunk radio . ig metall , which represents 310,000 auto , metal and engineering workers nationwide , has already reached agreement with eastern german steel companies for cutting the work week down to 35 hours over several years .
but around 9,000 metal workers remain on the picket lines in the eastern states of saxony , brandenburg and berlin . fears of damage to the economy the industry and some economists fear the strikes could damage the already weak east , where unemployment , currently around 18 percent , is double that of western germany .
they contend that eastern productivity still lags behind the west and that companies will be less likely to invest in eastern germany if the week is shortened , since wage costs will increase . “ it has a negative effect in a massive way on the east german labor market , ” wolfgang wiegard , an economic advisor to the government , told zdf television .
“ this strike is at the end of the day a strike for more unemployment in eastern germany . ” some experts believe if the union is successful in cutting eastern working hours , many companies will choose to move production jobs to neighboring low wage countries , such as poland and the czech republic , that will join the european union next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the lost production costing bmw an estimated € 38 million -lrb- $ 44 million -rrb- per day , the company has said it may rethink its planned investment in eastern germany .
bmw is currently building a plant in saxony near leipzig that , when completed , will employ around 5,000 people . ig metall has given employers an ultimatum to return to the negotiating table by wednesday , or the union will expand the strikes to other plants . over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schröder appealed to both sides to come together .
“ it would be better if there were an agreement an hour too soon instead of an hour too late .
i ’ m counting on both sides to be reasonable and end this as soon as possible , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike spreads to berlin and brandenburg worker ’ s in germany ’ s metal and engineering industry extended their strike to two more eastern states on tuesday to push through demands for cutting their workweek down to the 35 hours currently enjoyed in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 belgium to amend controversial war crimes law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister verhofstadt insists the new changes have nothing to do with u.s. pressure amid the furore that followed a spate of legal cases brought against prominent western figures since the end of the iraq war , the belgian government has decided to water down its controversial war crimes law . with international pressure growing , the belgian government announced sunday it would be amending its controversial war crimes law for the second time this year , limiting its application to citizens and residents of belgium .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "
it seems that a contributing factor to the new amendments was an action brought by a local opposition party in belgium against foreign minister luis michel , citing his involvement in an arms deal to nepal .
the legislation was hurriedly prepared soon after .
law used by the politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law was first used in war crimes cases in rwanda .
as it stands , the unique 1993 law allows charges to be brought to a belgian court regardless of where the war crimes took place .
first applied against rwandans implicated in the 1994 genocide in the african country , the law has since been used by human rights campaigners , political groups and disgruntled individuals to file complaints against a score of international figures .
the highest profile case to date under the original law was an action brought against israeli leader ariel sharon by survivors of a 1982 massacre of palestinian refugees in lebanon by lebanese christian militiamen .
the case provoked outrage in israel and has been suspended given sharon 's immunity .
but even before rumsfeld 's threat to boycott all nato meetings on june 12 , the belgian government had introduced a first set of changes to the legislation to allow the authorities to block cases brought against citizens from countries judged to have fair legal systems .
amendments limit law to belgians the latest amendments would reduce the law 's global reach , limiting the power of belgian courts to cases with a direct link to the country , such as when victims or suspects are belgian citizens or residents .
it is intended to make it harder for foreigners to initiate proceedings under the legislation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thumbs up from belgium 's foreign minister louis michel .
it was unclear whether the changes had placated washington , as there was no official comment from the white house .
belgian officials are confident , however , that the new changes should satisfy u.s. concerns .
foreign minister michel said the changes would end " rash and annoying complaints that wrongly target figures from partner countries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , right , welcomes german foreign minister joschka fischer in beirut , lebanon .
the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell , jordanian king abdullah ii , qatari foreign minister hamed bin jassim , and jordanian prime minister ali abu-al-ragheb , from left , look on during a meeting between powell with arab foreign ministers participating in the world economic forum in the jordanian dead sea resort town of southern shuneh .
-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .
whether that offer will be accepted or not , he said , depended on the u.s.-led coalition now in charge in iraq .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 belgium to amend controversial war crimes law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister verhofstadt insists the new changes have nothing to do with u.s. pressure amid the furore that followed a spate of legal cases brought against prominent western figures since the end of the iraq war , the belgian government has decided to water down its controversial war crimes law . with international pressure growing , the belgian government announced sunday it would be amending its controversial war crimes law for the second time this year , limiting its application to citizens and residents of belgium .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .
recent outbreaks of violence have included the killing of a senior hamas leader by israeli special forces in the west bank town of hebron and the death of four palestinian militants who were killed in an explosion on the gaza strip .
witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

-lrb- ap photo / royal palace , yousef allan , ho -rrb- free trade has been a central theme and the americans are pushing the establishment of a free trade agreement linking the region with the u.s. , saying freer trade is part of the answer to the middle east 's record of poor economic growth . experts at the forum have also been tackling topics such as building high-tech industries , developing tourism , managing water resources and putting arab banking practices in place . during fischer 's time at the forum on saturday , he offered germany 's support in the rebuilding of iraq .
whether that offer will be accepted or not , he said , depended on the u.s.-led coalition now in charge in iraq .

witnesses said the four were killed when a bomb they were planning for israelis blew up prematurely . bringing old enemies on board fischer 's middle east trip takes him to two countries which have long been enemies of israel and are considered key players in the region 's stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah gorillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . " i hope that we can find an agreement that all the regional players will support , because we think it is a great opportunity , " fischer told reporters .
" time is running very rapidly .
i think this opportunity should be used . " still , fischer indirectly rejected suggestions for the drawing up of a second road map that promotes a peace between israel , syria and lebanon .
france had said earlier this month that the european union was considering such a plan .
fischer stressed that the existing plan , drawn up by washington , should be brought forward .
the current road map envisions negotiations between israel and its neighbors only in the second phase .
however , fischer said he was open to " creative ideas " from players in the region that could help move the peace process along . on monday , fischer also met with the lebanese president emile lahoud before flying to syria for a one-hour meeting with that country 's president , bashar al-assad . after the meeting in damascus , fischer told reporters he had called on the syrian government to support the quartet 's plan , in order to play " a constructive role " in the situation . syria 's foreign minister , faruq al-shara , said his country did not want a confrontation with israel , but a comprehensive peace .
however , he repeated lebanon 's concerns .
" it is not acceptable for lebanon and syria to get pushed aside in the road map . " fischer 's last stop is egypt , where he is scheduled to hold meetings with president hosni mubarak on tuesday . stability through trade the german foreign minister kicked off this latest middle east trip at the annual meeting of the world economic forum , which has begun its final session in jordan . the forum , which has brought together more than a thousand leaders from the worlds of business and politics , has been dominated by the reconstruction of iraq and the israeli-palestinian conflict .
now leaders are discussing strategies to stimulate the region 's economies , which analysts say is a key to lasting stability .

the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work . joschka fischer said lebanon and syria can play a constructive role in bringing the bloody conflict between the israelis and palestinians to an end .
the german foreign minister has been crisscrossing the middle east since saturday taking the current temperature of regional leaders as he throws his weight behind the internationally-backed road map for peace . " i 'm here to explore the visions of those who are in charge in beirut and damascus , " fischer told reporters after talks with lebanese foreign minister jean obeid .
" what can we do to enhance this process based on the legitimate interests of lebanon and syria ?
i think both countries can play a very constructive and very productive role . " despite the inclusive words , fischer met with resistance to the current form of the road map in talks with lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri , who insisted on more consideration of the interests of lebanon and syria in planning the way toward peace .
without the close involvement of both countries , hariri said , a lasting regional peace would not be possible .
he argued that the current plan - backed by an international " quartet " consisting of the united state , the united nations , the european union and russia - did not involve syria and lebanon to the extent it should . success of the road map to peace has been cast into doubt by an increase in violence that erupted almost directly after the plan was launched 18 days ago at a summit in jordan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.06.2003 belgium to amend controversial war crimes law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister verhofstadt insists the new changes have nothing to do with u.s. pressure amid the furore that followed a spate of legal cases brought against prominent western figures since the end of the iraq war , the belgian government has decided to water down its controversial war crimes law . with international pressure growing , the belgian government announced sunday it would be amending its controversial war crimes law for the second time this year , limiting its application to citizens and residents of belgium .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt however is denying charges his government has backed down in the face of intense u.s. criticism of the law . the united states recently threatened to force nato 's headquarters out of brussels with defense secretary donald rumsfeld vowing to freeze american funding for the alliance 's new € 303.4 million -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- headquarters if the law was not revoked .
war crimes accusations the international row between belgium and the united states has been escalating over the last few weeks since the end of the iraq war , with lawsuits brought by independent parties against president george w. bush , rumsfeld , secretary of state colin powell and the u.s. commander of operation iraqi freedom , general tommy franks .
the charges , for alleged war abuses in iraq , have infuriated the americans and they have voiced their anger in the loudest possible terms , insisting that the law should be abandoned .
but the belgians maintain that the latest changes to the law were not signs that the government was bowing to the bush administration .
" it 's not american pressure .
if anything , that would have the opposite effect , " verhofstadt said .
" we wanted to find a solution that allows us to keep the law . "

california 's wine belt is feeling the pinch the seeds of the oversupply were sown in the 1990s when demand skyrocketed and a booming economy prompted growers to plant more vines .
during the late 1990s , plantings soared by 45 % .
but timing is everything in the wine business , and those grapes are now maturing in an altogether different economic climate .
the downturn has hit drinkers ' wallets hard , and the golden state 's vineyards are swimming in excess wine .
a report by the california agricultural statistics service shows that the 2002 harvest produced 3.79 million tons of grapes , 12.5 % more than the year before .
prices sank 17 % to $ 462 a ton over the same period .
family fortunes at his central valley farm in lodi , 120 miles east of san francisco , rodney schatz and his family have been growing grapes for the last three generations .
the business is bigger and so the magnitude of a downturn is bigger bill turrentine , wine broker " this is probably the worst downturn i have seen in my lifetime , but that comes on the heels of ten to twelve years of prosperity , so it 's only natural for it to cycle much harder , " he said .
" it 's been a nice long run uphill , so now it 's going to be a run downhill , " he said .
rodney is luckier that most .
he has n't had to do what some other growers have been forced to do - either let their grapes wither on the vine , or pull them out and invest in replanting crops like alfalfa and almonds , for which there is a ready market .
according to the california grape growers ' association , 70,000 acres of raisin , wine and table grapes have been ploughed under in the last year in the central valley , the golden state 's largest grape growing region .
while rodney has avoided taking any drastic measures , he has adapted to harsh economic realities by grafting some of his land and replacing chardonnay grapes , where there is an oversupply , with petite syrah .
he is also working closely with the bank and , like everyone else , is feeling the pain .
" in ' 97 , ' 98 , ' 99 it was no problem to get eight , nine , a thousand , eleven hundred dollars a ton for just about anything or everything , " he says .
" now those prices are three fifty , four hundred , five hundred dollars .
so less than half right now is the norm . "
boom and bust about 90 % of all grapes grown in the united states come from california , where winemaking is a $ 2.6bn industry .
bill turrentine of turrentine wines in san anselmo , 20 miles north of san francisco , is a broker who has been in the business for over 26 years .
as he consults his so-called " manic depressive wine business wheel of fortune " , he says what 's happening in the industry is purely cyclical .
but he admits the emergence of the " techno-rich " with a taste for an expensive tipple has added to the severity of the downturn in california .
" the business is bigger and so the magnitude of a downturn is bigger , " he says .
the short cycle was just phenomenally good , partly because of the silicon valley tech boom and its side-product : lots of well-off people spending very high amounts on wine .
" when they went away , it made this downturn more difficult , perhaps . "
cheap and cheerful one company celebrating the glut is branco wines of ceres in california 's central valley , with its charles shaw brand - nicknamed " two buck chuck " because it sells for $ 1.99 .
wine drinkers have become cost-conscious branco spokesman harvey poster told bbc news online that the amount of charles shaw wine the company is selling is making the industry sit up and take notice .
" analysts estimate -lrb- sales -rrb- at around five to six million cases in the past year , which would make it the fastest selling wine ever in america and i assume the world , " he says .
trader joes , which sells " two buck chuck " exclusively through its 200-odd stores , would attest to that .
their san rafael store in marin county sells around a thousand bottles on a good day .
manager james gibbs says : " it 's called the charles shaw phenomenon .
it 's a great bottle of wine with a fantastic price .
" we buy it by the pallet , we move into the store by the pallet , and they take it out by the case . "
two buck future ?
two buck chuck has become a legend in the wine industry , and its fans just love it .
clutching two bottles of merlot , paula says : " two buck chuck is great value .
it 's equivalent to a ten dollar bottle of wine . "
jeanette sears , a first time buyer , left the store with four cases .
at around $ 28 with tax , she says it 's too good a bargain to miss .
" i think it 's exciting because we entertain a lot , " she says .
" it 's the price of a bottle of water and i would n't have picked it up unless i had seen people make a big fuss about it . "
analysts predict another two years of pain for the industry but say that one way to keep afloat is to either improve the quality of the product , or wholeheartedly adopt the " two buck chuck " mentality by making the wine too cheap to ignore .

it 's a great bottle of wine with a fantastic price .
" we buy it by the pallet , we move into the store by the pallet , and they take it out by the case . "
two buck future ?
two buck chuck has become a legend in the wine industry , and its fans just love it .
clutching two bottles of merlot , paula says : " two buck chuck is great value .
it 's equivalent to a ten dollar bottle of wine . "
jeanette sears , a first time buyer , left the store with four cases .
at around $ 28 with tax , she says it 's too good a bargain to miss .
" i think it 's exciting because we entertain a lot , " she says .
" it 's the price of a bottle of water and i would n't have picked it up unless i had seen people make a big fuss about it . "
analysts predict another two years of pain for the industry but say that one way to keep afloat is to either improve the quality of the product , or wholeheartedly adopt the " two buck chuck " mentality by making the wine too cheap to ignore .

paul bremer , the us official running iraq , told reporters at the wef meeting in jordan that he expected to sell about $ 5.5bn of oil over the next six months , about two thirds of which would actually arrive by the end of the year .

mr al-ghadban , meanwhile , said current production is about 800,000 barrels a day , and could reaach 2 million by the end of the year - although he cautioned that it would probably be 2005 before the industry could make a financial contribution to iraq 's reconstruction .
and there was always the risk of more sabotage , he said .
" we have had repeated acts of political sabotage against the pipelines and the refineries in the last month , obviously efforts by supporters of the previous regime to disrupt our capacity to work with the iraqi people , " mr al-ghadhban said .
" we 're going to have to deal with that , you could have some problems meeting production levels . "

the comments of federation chairman irwin montgomery came in the wake of a suggestion by chief constable hugh orde that a type of truth and reconciliation process may be needed to bring closure to the past .
mr montgomery said the federation 's members were " infuriated " at the suggestion of such a commission .
he said : " the only people who would benefit from this would be the terrorists and paramilitaries , who would use the forum to justify their crimes . "
mr montgomery said his members wanted closure for the families , but stressed there had to be justice .
" we can only achieve that if the unsolved murders of police officers and indeed the other 1,800 civilian unsolved murders , are properly investigated and the responsible people identified , " he said .
' not for everyone ' speaking two weeks ago , hugh orde said : " there needs to be something that gives everyone an opportunity to say their piece , to get the best explanation they can on what happened to their families , their loved ones , so that they can then get on with their lives . "
however , he said it would not be satisfactory for everyone .
" i 've met families that want a wide spectrum of outcomes , be it revenge - or at the other end - simple understanding , with no blame attached , " he said .
" it 's a debate which is partly academic , it 's partly practical but it does need to happen . "
a truth and reconciliation forum was set up in south africa after the end of apartheid .
it granted amnesty to many of those whose testimonies it heard .
northern ireland secretary paul murphy said a commission was one of a number of possibilities the government was prepared to consider in order to draw a line under northern ireland 's troubled past .

the australian company has now closed all of its british-based life services business to new clients .
the job cuts come on top of about 4,700 previously announced by amp .
amp 's expansion into the uk financial services industry caused the company serious difficulties , as billions of dollars had to be pumped into the uk units to keep their reserves above the minimum capital requirement of the british industry regulator .
the uk operations , including npi and pearl , are due to be demerged from the profitable australian and new zealand operations .
shares suffering chief executive andrew mohl said he had considered selling , rationalising and restructuring npi .
" after thorough consideration of all the options , we have decided that retaining the npi book and closing it to new sales is in the best interests of both shareholders and customers , " mohl said in a statement to the australian stock exchange .

the flotation is being priced at 27-31 euros a share - slightly less than was forecast when the sale was announced in march , but still europe 's biggest flotation this year .
according to the details of the initial public offering unveiled on monday , the bank austria selloff should raise about two-thirds of the 1.7bn euros of fresh capital the bank says it wants to shore up its balance sheet .
hvb bought bank austria for 7.8bn euros in 2000 and took it private as a vehicle for its central and eastern european operations , in which region it has a 28 % market share .
tough times the pricing of the 25 % stake on offer values bank austria at 3-3.5bn euros less than what hvb paid for it .
but that decline is still considerably better than the recent performance turned in by hvb 's own shares .
the group 's stock hit a 20-year low in march of 6.88 euros , on fears that the weakness of the bank 's balance sheet would send it running to shareholders to ask for more money .
the fears came at a time when most of germany 's banks were revealed heavy losses , and rumours of possible state bailouts were beginning to circulate .
now , though , hvb 's shares have recovered to more than 15 euros apiece .

ahead of the midsummer event police warned people not to hold any unlicensed " mass gatherings " afterwards .
english heritage reopened the site to the public after the closures and clashes of previous years .
astrologer roy gillett , who was among the crowds there to watch the sunrise just before 0500 bst , said it was important to celebrate this the longest day of the year .
friends shared the dawn experience he said druids were joined at the 5,000 year-old world heritage site by anyone who wanted to " keep in touch with the flow of nature " .
revellers were delighted that the good weather allowed the sunrise to be seen over the ancient stones .
the sight of the sun breaking through trees on the horizon over the heel stone was met with a loud chorus of drums , whistles , whoops and shrieks and music from samba-style bands .
because the solstice was at a weekend many more people were able to make the pilgrimage to wiltshire from all over the country .
the crowd was a mix of druids , pagans , new age travellers , nature lovers and anyone else curious to take part in the experience .

" we have n't come in the past because it 's usually on a work day so we 've taken advantage this year . "
party warning police were on patrol in case of trouble but a wiltshire force spokesman said there had only been about 10 arrests .
these were mainly for minor offences such as public order breaches , drunkenness and drug possession .
police in the neighbouring county of hampshire had warned they would not tolerate any illegal gatherings after the solstice .
officers were out in force in the area between basingstoke , andover and the wiltshire border and thwarted any attempts to hold parties .
