the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .

gaudi , creator of the barcelona cathedral sagrada familia , envisaged the structure -lrb- photo -rrb- in 1908 for a new york hotel " attraction " that was never built .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .

the 26-year-old schüttler , entering the competition seeded 31 had never further than the fourth round of a major tournament before arriving at melbourne park earlier this month .

on reaching sunday 's final , he became the first german player since michael stich at the 1996 french open to play in a major singles final and was only the second german to reach the men 's final in the 98-year history of the australian open .
unfortunately , the young german rarely looked comfortable with these facts and was easy pickings for a rejuvenated agassi on blistering from .
schüttler blown away by rampant agassi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre agassi .
the american blew schüttler off the court in one hour and 16 minutes , winning his fourth australian open title in straight sets 6-2 6-2 6-1 to become the third oldest winner of a slam title in the open era at the grand old age of 32 .
the figures on paper show the difference in quality between the two players : agassi hit 30 winners to schüttler 's 16 and only made half as many unforced errors as the german while schuettler got just 51 per cent of his first serves into play , and only won 58 per cent of the points when he did .
that figure dropped to a miserable 28 per cent on his second serve .
but statistics only tell half the story .
even in top form , the german would have needed divine intervention to overcome the rampant agassi .
the veteran champion , with eight grand slam singles titles under his belt , exploded out of the blocks spectacular fashion , stringing together a run of eight points to lead 2-0 .
errors punished in whirlwind match it looked like agassi would be in the shower before the hour was out as the world number two broke schüttler 's serve again before the shell-shocked german steadied himself and broke back in the fourth game .
this proved to be just a blip as the relentless agassi engineered two more break points in schuettler 's fourth service game and broke when the german overhit a forehand .

schüttler battled back in an attempt to delay agassi winning the first set but the german threw a 0-30 lead against the american 's serve by throwing in two forehand errors .
the first set was in the bag in just 29 minutes .
agassi claimed the second set by the same score in three minutes less to leave schüttler reeling .
and the german 's game continued to come apart at the seams under the might of agassi 's assault and he was broken three further times in the third set .
while agassi celebrated another successful trip down under , another german could afford a rueful smile - agassi 's wife , steffi graf .
mixed messages from potential dream team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back on court soon ?
it has been widely reported that the couple agreed on a wager before the australian open whereby graf would come out of retirement to partner her husband on court if agassi triumphed at melbourne park in sunday ’ s final .
the couple , who married in 2001 and have a son , jaden gil , are expected to enter the mixed doubles competition at the french open in may - if agassi can hold his wife to the agreement .
graf retired in 1999 after an illustrious career in which she won 22 grand slam titles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rainer schüttler tastes victory german tennis can once again dare to dream of taking home a grand slam title as rainer schüttler slams his way into the finals of the australian open with a sensational victory over american andy roddick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rocket-like skyscraper designed after a sketch by the spanish architect antoni gaudi .
gaudi , creator of the barcelona cathedral sagrada familia , envisaged the structure -lrb- photo -rrb- in 1908 for a new york hotel " attraction " that was never built .
the structure would not house a hotel , though .
rather , it would serve as a memorial to sept .
11 .
public input the committee of city and state authorities formed to supervise the redevelopment of ground zero , the lower manhattan development corporation -lrb- lmdc -rrb- , wants to arrive at a single master plan by february .
the lmdc has started a comprehensive outreach campaign to include the city 's community in planning the future of the 16-acre world trade center site .
however , just how much of public opinion will be considered is unclear .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .

the structure would not house a hotel , though .

public input the committee of city and state authorities formed to supervise the redevelopment of ground zero , the lower manhattan development corporation -lrb- lmdc -rrb- , wants to arrive at a single master plan by february .
the lmdc has started a comprehensive outreach campaign to include the city 's community in planning the future of the 16-acre world trade center site .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .

gaudi , creator of the barcelona cathedral sagrada familia , envisaged the structure -lrb- photo -rrb- in 1908 for a new york hotel " attraction " that was never built .
the structure would not house a hotel , though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "

these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

the 26-year-old schüttler , entering the competition seeded 31 had never further than the fourth round of a major tournament before arriving at melbourne park earlier this month .
after an amazing run through earlier rounds , the german had stunned the tennis world by reaching the final at the expense of the equally unfancied andy roddick .
on reaching sunday 's final , he became the first german player since michael stich at the 1996 french open to play in a major singles final and was only the second german to reach the men 's final in the 98-year history of the australian open .
unfortunately , the young german rarely looked comfortable with these facts and was easy pickings for a rejuvenated agassi on blistering from .
schüttler blown away by rampant agassi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre agassi .
the american blew schüttler off the court in one hour and 16 minutes , winning his fourth australian open title in straight sets 6-2 6-2 6-1 to become the third oldest winner of a slam title in the open era at the grand old age of 32 .
the figures on paper show the difference in quality between the two players : agassi hit 30 winners to schüttler 's 16 and only made half as many unforced errors as the german while schuettler got just 51 per cent of his first serves into play , and only won 58 per cent of the points when he did .
that figure dropped to a miserable 28 per cent on his second serve .
but statistics only tell half the story .
even in top form , the german would have needed divine intervention to overcome the rampant agassi .
the veteran champion , with eight grand slam singles titles under his belt , exploded out of the blocks spectacular fashion , stringing together a run of eight points to lead 2-0 .
errors punished in whirlwind match it looked like agassi would be in the shower before the hour was out as the world number two broke schüttler 's serve again before the shell-shocked german steadied himself and broke back in the fourth game .
this proved to be just a blip as the relentless agassi engineered two more break points in schuettler 's fourth service game and broke when the german overhit a forehand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unhappy rainer schüttler .
schüttler battled back in an attempt to delay agassi winning the first set but the german threw a 0-30 lead against the american 's serve by throwing in two forehand errors .
the first set was in the bag in just 29 minutes .
agassi claimed the second set by the same score in three minutes less to leave schüttler reeling .
and the german 's game continued to come apart at the seams under the might of agassi 's assault and he was broken three further times in the third set .
while agassi celebrated another successful trip down under , another german could afford a rueful smile - agassi 's wife , steffi graf .
mixed messages from potential dream team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back on court soon ?
it has been widely reported that the couple agreed on a wager before the australian open whereby graf would come out of retirement to partner her husband on court if agassi triumphed at melbourne park in sunday ’ s final .
the couple , who married in 2001 and have a son , jaden gil , are expected to enter the mixed doubles competition at the french open in may - if agassi can hold his wife to the agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.01.2003 sale season begins amid economic doldrums großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark-down mania germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .
" if it would get really cold again , consumers will start buying . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .
" if it would get really cold again , consumers will start buying . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 26-year-old schüttler , entering the competition seeded 31 had never further than the fourth round of a major tournament before arriving at melbourne park earlier this month .
after an amazing run through earlier rounds , the german had stunned the tennis world by reaching the final at the expense of the equally unfancied andy roddick .
on reaching sunday 's final , he became the first german player since michael stich at the 1996 french open to play in a major singles final and was only the second german to reach the men 's final in the 98-year history of the australian open .
unfortunately , the young german rarely looked comfortable with these facts and was easy pickings for a rejuvenated agassi on blistering from .

the american blew schüttler off the court in one hour and 16 minutes , winning his fourth australian open title in straight sets 6-2 6-2 6-1 to become the third oldest winner of a slam title in the open era at the grand old age of 32 .
the figures on paper show the difference in quality between the two players : agassi hit 30 winners to schüttler 's 16 and only made half as many unforced errors as the german while schuettler got just 51 per cent of his first serves into play , and only won 58 per cent of the points when he did .
that figure dropped to a miserable 28 per cent on his second serve .
but statistics only tell half the story .
even in top form , the german would have needed divine intervention to overcome the rampant agassi .
the veteran champion , with eight grand slam singles titles under his belt , exploded out of the blocks spectacular fashion , stringing together a run of eight points to lead 2-0 .
errors punished in whirlwind match it looked like agassi would be in the shower before the hour was out as the world number two broke schüttler 's serve again before the shell-shocked german steadied himself and broke back in the fourth game .
this proved to be just a blip as the relentless agassi engineered two more break points in schuettler 's fourth service game and broke when the german overhit a forehand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unhappy rainer schüttler .
schüttler battled back in an attempt to delay agassi winning the first set but the german threw a 0-30 lead against the american 's serve by throwing in two forehand errors .
the first set was in the bag in just 29 minutes .
agassi claimed the second set by the same score in three minutes less to leave schüttler reeling .
and the german 's game continued to come apart at the seams under the might of agassi 's assault and he was broken three further times in the third set .
while agassi celebrated another successful trip down under , another german could afford a rueful smile - agassi 's wife , steffi graf .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rocket-like skyscraper designed after a sketch by the spanish architect antoni gaudi .
gaudi , creator of the barcelona cathedral sagrada familia , envisaged the structure -lrb- photo -rrb- in 1908 for a new york hotel " attraction " that was never built .
the structure would not house a hotel , though .
rather , it would serve as a memorial to sept .

the lmdc has started a comprehensive outreach campaign to include the city 's community in planning the future of the 16-acre world trade center site .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "

these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .

a final decision is expected to be made by the munich city council on wednesday .
the exhibit , organized by anatomy professor gunther von hagens , includes plasticized corpses and body parts .
it has drawn millions of visitors in the european cities where it has previously been shown .
but authorities in munich say the exhibit violates the german constitution and a bavarian burial law .
in the southern state , as elsewhere in germany , bodies must be buried no longer than 96 hours after death .
the state is also seeking an injunction to prevent hagens from carrying out a public autopsy in the city .
during the show 's stop in london last november , hagens conducted an autopsy before a live audience and television cameras - the first public autopsy in 170 years . dw-world.de ' body worlds ' creator performs public autopsy a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.01.2003 sale season begins amid economic doldrums großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark-down mania germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.

a final decision is expected to be made by the munich city council on wednesday .
the exhibit , organized by anatomy professor gunther von hagens , includes plasticized corpses and body parts .
it has drawn millions of visitors in the european cities where it has previously been shown .
but authorities in munich say the exhibit violates the german constitution and a bavarian burial law .
in the southern state , as elsewhere in germany , bodies must be buried no longer than 96 hours after death .
the state is also seeking an injunction to prevent hagens from carrying out a public autopsy in the city .
during the show 's stop in london last november , hagens conducted an autopsy before a live audience and television cameras - the first public autopsy in 170 years . dw-world.de ' body worlds ' creator performs public autopsy a controversial german professor conducts the first public autopsy in great britain in 170 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.01.2003 sale season begins amid economic doldrums großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark-down mania germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .

the 26-year-old schüttler , entering the competition seeded 31 had never further than the fourth round of a major tournament before arriving at melbourne park earlier this month .
after an amazing run through earlier rounds , the german had stunned the tennis world by reaching the final at the expense of the equally unfancied andy roddick .
on reaching sunday 's final , he became the first german player since michael stich at the 1996 french open to play in a major singles final and was only the second german to reach the men 's final in the 98-year history of the australian open .
unfortunately , the young german rarely looked comfortable with these facts and was easy pickings for a rejuvenated agassi on blistering from .
schüttler blown away by rampant agassi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre agassi .
the american blew schüttler off the court in one hour and 16 minutes , winning his fourth australian open title in straight sets 6-2 6-2 6-1 to become the third oldest winner of a slam title in the open era at the grand old age of 32 .
the figures on paper show the difference in quality between the two players : agassi hit 30 winners to schüttler 's 16 and only made half as many unforced errors as the german while schuettler got just 51 per cent of his first serves into play , and only won 58 per cent of the points when he did .
that figure dropped to a miserable 28 per cent on his second serve .
but statistics only tell half the story .
even in top form , the german would have needed divine intervention to overcome the rampant agassi .
the veteran champion , with eight grand slam singles titles under his belt , exploded out of the blocks spectacular fashion , stringing together a run of eight points to lead 2-0 .
errors punished in whirlwind match it looked like agassi would be in the shower before the hour was out as the world number two broke schüttler 's serve again before the shell-shocked german steadied himself and broke back in the fourth game .
this proved to be just a blip as the relentless agassi engineered two more break points in schuettler 's fourth service game and broke when the german overhit a forehand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unhappy rainer schüttler .
schüttler battled back in an attempt to delay agassi winning the first set but the german threw a 0-30 lead against the american 's serve by throwing in two forehand errors .
the first set was in the bag in just 29 minutes .
agassi claimed the second set by the same score in three minutes less to leave schüttler reeling .
and the german 's game continued to come apart at the seams under the might of agassi 's assault and he was broken three further times in the third set .
while agassi celebrated another successful trip down under , another german could afford a rueful smile - agassi 's wife , steffi graf .
mixed messages from potential dream team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back on court soon ?
it has been widely reported that the couple agreed on a wager before the australian open whereby graf would come out of retirement to partner her husband on court if agassi triumphed at melbourne park in sunday ’ s final .
the couple , who married in 2001 and have a son , jaden gil , are expected to enter the mixed doubles competition at the french open in may - if agassi can hold his wife to the agreement .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .
" if it would get really cold again , consumers will start buying . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.01.2003 no respite in sight for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cause for celebration back then - german chancellor schröder after his election win last september there 's not much to celebrate as gerhard schröder completes 100 days in office this week .
plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .
" there 's hardly any doubt at the moment that germany runs the risk of isolating itself internationally with the kind of support it 's getting , " lösche said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad marks for schröder after about-face on taxes two public opinion polls released over the weekend show the steepest plunge in public support for a chancellor since the end of world war ii .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.01.2003 sale season begins amid economic doldrums großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mark-down mania germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .

the lmdc has started a comprehensive outreach campaign to include the city 's community in planning the future of the 16-acre world trade center site .

daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .

the future of the world trade center site is being called the first great architectural project of the 21st century .
two european architects top the list of favorites with their proposals for ground zero . never before has an architectural project been so heavily debated .
this is n't just any project , though .
the future of the world trade center site is one which must meet certain economic needs , but also comply with the emotional burden weighing on ground zero .
the seven teams of prominent architects from around the world are facing difficult restraints .
the commercial and retail space lost when the twin towers collapsed needs to be replaced , with a minimum requirement of 6.5 million square feet .
the proposals also have to reserve space for a permanent memorial , the design of which will be the subject of a separate international competition .
the plans put forward in new york last month include cities in the sky , parks , giant reflecting pools , sky memorials and sunken museums .
two teams , both from europe , are leading the pack .
daniel libeskind of berlin is best-known for his design of the new jewish museum in berlin , which has earned him the monicker of " memorial expert . "
but sir norman foster 's london-based foster and partners - who designed the new german parliament in berlin - is also a favorite for its sleek design .
" gardens of the world " libeskind envisages a tower with a " vertical garden " that would stretch 1,776 feet high , a reference to the year of u.s. independence .
this would make it the tallest spire in the world .
the glass-enclosed " gardens of the world , " with layers of plant life from all around the globe , would be attached to a slightly shorter office building .
" why gardens ?
because gardens are a constant affirmation of life , " libeskind explained at his presentation in new york .
" a skyscraper rises above its predecessors , reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty , restoring the spiritual peak to the city and creating an icon that speaks to our vitality in the face of danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy , " said libeskind .
the polish-born architect - a naturalized u.s. citizen who has lived in berlin for the past 14 years - also created two large public places to commemorate the dead : the " park of heroes " and the " wedge of light . "
the latter would be laid out in such a way that on the anniversary of the attack , the sun would shine down without shadow between the hours of 8:46 a.m. , when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m. , when the second tower collapsed .
redesigning the twin towers foster 's team focuses on the memory of the twin towers .
" the iconic skyline must be reassembled , " foster said in new york .
" we propose to celebrate new york 's positive spirit with a unique twinned tower - the most secure , the greenest and the tallest in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proposed design by foster and partners .
his firm proposes a crystalline skyscraper , which would be " twinned " .
" its two halves kiss at three points , creating public observation platforms , exhibits , cafes and other amenities , " he said .
these links also have a safety benefit , as escape routes from one tower to the other .
in addition , the connections break down the tower 's scale into " village-like clusters " , each with its own atrium .
" these tree-filled spaces - parks in the sky - will purify the natural air that will ventilate the building , " he said .
a multi-layered facade would enable the towers to eliminate the need for air conditioning for up to 80 percent of the year .
a rocket in manhattan one alternative project has little chance of realization .
a boston architect is leading an interest group to incorporate a rocket-like skyscraper designed by the spanish artist and architect antoni gaudi on ground zero .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rocket-like skyscraper designed after a sketch by the spanish architect antoni gaudi .
gaudi , creator of the barcelona cathedral sagrada familia , envisaged the structure -lrb- photo -rrb- in 1908 for a new york hotel " attraction " that was never built .
the structure would not house a hotel , though .
rather , it would serve as a memorial to sept .
11 .
public input the committee of city and state authorities formed to supervise the redevelopment of ground zero , the lower manhattan development corporation -lrb- lmdc -rrb- , wants to arrive at a single master plan by february .
the lmdc has started a comprehensive outreach campaign to include the city 's community in planning the future of the 16-acre world trade center site .
however , just how much of public opinion will be considered is unclear .
but it is safe to say that no architect will be able to live up to all of the expectations weighing on ground zero . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the lower manhattan development corporation -lrb- lmdc -rrb- view the new world trade center design concepts .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .
in a surprising move , germany also appeard to get france to reconsider its support for a u.s.-led war against iraq , at least if public statements are to be believed .
germany , which temporarily takes over the u.n. security council in february , has made it clear that it will vote against any u.n. resolution calling for military action against iraq .

plummeting popularity and grim economic news have battered his image and overshadowed the few high points of his tenure . as german chancellor gerhard schröder heads towards the 100-day mark in office on wednesday , his worsening domestic woes appear to sit uneasily with growing recognition of his international role as an unflinching opponent of a u.s.-led war against iraq .
with unemployment hovering around 4.5 million , support for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at a historic low of 25 percent and a possible crushing defeat in crucial upcoming regional elections , schröder ‘ s problems at home show no signs of easing .
chancellor under fire for reneging on promises the problems started soon after his re-election last september .
just a few days into office , a damaging series of revelations on the dramatically poor state of the german economy sparked rumors and accusations that the government coalition had deliberately misinformed the public .
to make matters worse , the government ’ s proposals to stave off a worsening of the economic situation - which included a hike in taxes - led to a huge public outcry as people perceived the chancellor to be backtracking on his electoral promises .
the result was a huge loss of confidence in schröder and his party , a fact that was reflected in plummeting ratings in opinion polls and angry editorials in the media .
while schröder was in the second spot last september in popularity ratings conducted by infratest-dimap - close behind germany 's most popular politician joschka fischer - in january , the chancellor 's personal rating had slipped to sixth spot .
politicians such as economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin of the green party overtook the chancellor in popularity .
half-hearted reforms ?
according to professor peter lösche at the göttingen university , a large part of the current problems facing the spd-green coalition are of their own making .
" the red-greens went completely unprepared into negotiations to deal with the country ’ s problems .
rather than think deeply about a solution , they just attempted to deal with it with a patchwork of reforms , there was just no evidence of a single clearly thought out concept , " he told dw-world .
in recent months , schröder ’ s party has come up with a slew of labor market reforms and teams of experts aimed at making the labor market more flexible and efficient .
a strategy paper leaked by the chancellor ’ s office has also called for wide-ranging and fundamental reforms in germany ’ s welfare system , particularly health and pensions .
in a sign that he was serious about effecting a structural change in society , schröder said in a new year ’ s eve address to the nation : " we will only be able to keep up our standard of living , our welfare system , our good schools , roads and hospitals , all of which are the envy of so many people abroad , if we gather up the courage , together , to accept fundamental change . "
" everything must change so that everything can remain the same , " he said a few days earlier .
" we must alter our mentality . "
bleak economy undermines schröder 's efforts but despite his apparent will to change things , most of his proposals have been mired in heated debates both within the spd and the opposition .
though many have been welcomed by business , germany ’ s strong labor unions , which have traditionally been allies of the social democratic party , are aggrieved .
lösche believes that some of the reform proposals such as part-time work and the creation of new " temp " agencies as suggested by the hartz commission are " generally correct . "
" but the whole thing has failed to lead to a plausible , strategic concept . "
schröder ’ s attempts at reform have been further undermined by continuing bad news on the economic front .
last year the german economy is estimated to have slowed to a nine-year low of 0.2 percent and the prognosis for this year is not expected to be any better .
unemployment which hit a record 4.2 million last month is expected to continue rising .
consumer confidence has been at its lowest point since 1994 and the dax , germany ’ s leading stock-exchange index , dropped by 44 percent last year .
public-sector workers threatened to launch their first nationwide strike in a decade and even exports – the strongest pillar of germany ’ s economy – are beginning to sputter by the euro ’ s rise in value and a possible war in iraq .
last week germany was also issued a official warning by the eu commission for violating the stability and growth pact and failing to rein in its budget deficit .
schröder 's love-affair with the media over schröder ’ s cabinet has also been rocked in recent months by a string of embarrassing bunglings and contradictory statements by ministers on policy issues , notably on the delivery of patriot missiles to israel .
lösche says that " these contradictory noises from the government " have further eroded the government ’ s reputation .
schröder himself has lost his image as a " media-savvy " chancellor after his angry reactions to the press digging into his private life and speculating about his relationship with his wife .
in the latest instance , schröder filed a lawsuit against a british paper for printing rumors about his alleged affair with a german television presenter .
schröder finds resonance with anti-war stance but even as the chancellor faces one domestic fiasco after the other , he has been playing an influential role on the world stage in recent weeks .
last year , schröder antagonized washington with his anti-war stance and refusal to cooperate in a war against iraq .
at the time , the chancellor was accused of using iraq as an election ploy to woo pacifist voters and branded an " opportunist . "
but in recent weeks , opinion both within germany and in some european countries has swung sharply in favor of what is now perceived as germany ’ s bold anti-war stance in the face of strident american pressure to attack iraq .
schröder has also been credited with improving often frosty ties to france . at a historic celebration to commemorate 40 years of the franco-german elysée treaty last week , schröder and french president chirac signed a number of agreements aimed at intensifying cooperation .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .

retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost . as usual , the storm on the stores began at 8 a.m.
bargain-hungry shoppers across germany on monday eyed discounts of up to 80 percent that the country 's sales-starved retailers offered at the start of their annual winter close-out sale .
" germany 's cheapest weeks are beginning , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman for the association of german retailers .
the invasion on the stores is taking place against a backdrop of sweeping change and troubled times in german retailing .
in more economically prosperous times , sales were a rare item here .
under german laws that grew out of efforts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect consumers and small business , the government permitted retailers to hold close-out sales only twice a year - once in the winter and once in the summer .
the laws dictate that the winter sale may start on the last monday in january and the summer sale on the last monday in july .
each sale may last only 12 days , and it can only include clothing and other textiles , shoes , leather goods and sporting equipment .
eroding enforcement but enforcement of the laws is eroding as retailers try to entice euros from the pockets of consumers who are seeing their taxes climb and their chances of unemployment rise .
amid this gloomy economic environment , retail sales fell about 6 percent in november and are expected to have fallen a total of 2.5 percent to 3 percent during 2002 .
to offset such losses , stores immediately began to offer discounts of 50 percent after the christmas holidays .
one clothing retailer even offered customers a discount of € 20 -lrb- $ 21.65 -rrb- if they did a headstand .
the government is also planning to do its part by loosening the laws governing sales .
under a proposal released this month by justice minister brigitte zypries , stores could change the date of their sales to fit the dates for school vacations or hold annual spring and fall clearance sales .
the restrictions " have done the consumer more harm than good , " zypries told the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung .
as another step to help retailers , the government is proposing to give consumers four more hours of shopping time on saturday - until 8 p.m.
but the idea has run into resistance from the huge labor union ver.di , which represents workers in the retail industry .
" the law is a slap in the face for the 2.5 million employees in retailing and for the unions which were not even consulted on the matter , " a union leader , franziska wiethold , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
proposal runs into a delay the government originally planned to have the law take effect on april 1 .
but now officials hope to have it on the books by june 1 .
the news magazine focus attributed the delay to resistance among union members in the social democratic party , which is led by chancellor gerhard schröder .
a spokesman in the economics ministry would not comment on the report .
on monday , though , retailers were focused on the immediate goal of the day - moving merchandise .
and they seemed to like what they were seeing .
" we are really surprised .
there were 200 to 250 people waiting outside the door before 8 a.m. , " said günter biere , who runs the kaufhof department store in frankfurt told the news agency dpa .
before retailers opened their doors , they were hoping to sell off the loads of winter clothing still filling their warehouses .
" we are hoping on mother nature , " said kathrin hauber of the kaufhaus department store in munich told the news agency .

three people died on the spot , while eight others succumbed to their injuries on the way to hospital .

the three animals were the first batch of seals to survive the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- to be set free by the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals -lrb- rspca -rrb- .
they rejoined the devastated colony at blakeney point , on the north norfolk coast on friday .
more than half of the common seal population of about 4,000 in the wash at norfolk and lincolnshire , and on the north norfolk coast , died when the virus hit in august last year .
liquidised fish the pups are among 40 nursed back to health at the rspca 's wildlife hospital at east winch , near king 's lynn , norfolk .
alison charles , the hospital 's deputy manager , who saw the first of the seals leave by boat , said : " it was heartbreaking to watch the seals die despite our best efforts , but knowing these survivors have a future in the wild has made it all worthwhile . "
most of the 164 seals taken to the hospital were very ill and underweight .
the sick animals received rehydration fluids , progressing to a nutritious diet of liquidised fish , said the rspca .
as they improved the seal pups were moved from the isolation ward to intermediate pools , and then to outdoor pools once they could feed themselves .
the survival rate of seals hit by the virus is 25 % .
there is no treatment for the virus and no prevention for animals in the wild .
in 1988 half of the 3,000 seals in the wash and on the north norfolk coast died as a result of secondary infections from the virus , the spokeswoman .
she added : " it has taken 14 years for the population of common seals to return to its pre-1988 numbers but the effects of the 2002 outbreak will not be known until summer 2003 when a new count is made . "

more than half of the common seal population of about 4,000 in the wash at norfolk and lincolnshire , and on the north norfolk coast , died when the virus hit in august last year .
liquidised fish the pups are among 40 nursed back to health at the rspca 's wildlife hospital at east winch , near king 's lynn , norfolk .
alison charles , the hospital 's deputy manager , who saw the first of the seals leave by boat , said : " it was heartbreaking to watch the seals die despite our best efforts , but knowing these survivors have a future in the wild has made it all worthwhile . "
seals were treated at specialist centres most of the 164 seals taken to the hospital were very ill and underweight .
the sick animals received rehydration fluids , progressing to a nutritious diet of liquidised fish , said the rspca .
as they improved the seal pups were moved from the isolation ward to intermediate pools , and then to outdoor pools once they could feed themselves .
the survival rate of seals hit by the virus is 25 % .
there is no treatment for the virus and no prevention for animals in the wild .
in 1988 half of the 3,000 seals in the wash and on the north norfolk coast died as a result of secondary infections from the virus , the spokeswoman .
she added : " it has taken 14 years for the population of common seals to return to its pre-1988 numbers but the effects of the 2002 outbreak will not be known until summer 2003 when a new count is made . "

the answer to the uk affordable housing shortage may lie in the realms of science fiction .
some of the highest land prices in the world - especially in london - are prompting developers to think outside the two-up-two-down box .
in short , to offer affordable housing developers and housing associations have had to stamp down on land or building costs .
' micro ' and ' module ' flats and even pre-fabricated flat pack kit homes are all modern ways of squaring the affordable housing circle and resemble something straight out of isaac asimov or arthur c clarke sci-fi novels .
picture gallery see what designers have in store for you key workers britain 's booming housing market has left many potential first time buyers behind in its wake .
a lot of attention has focused on key public sector workers such as teachers or nurses unable to afford to clamber even onto the first rung of the property ladder .
council and housing association waiting lists are geared first and foremost to finding affordable homes for these workers .
" local authorities are very keen for us to concentrate on these people , in truth there is limited housing and priorities have to be made , " leander perry spokeswoman for the peabody trust , a london housing association told bbc news online .
microflats but private sector workers earning similar amounts - or less - enjoy no such preferential treatment .
" the research shows that there is a whole group of single private sector workers who are earning decent salaries but still ca n't afford to buy a home .
little is offered to these people , " sam price , spokeswoman for the microflat company which has taken a minimalist solution to this growing problem .
a microflat prototype was first exhibited in the front window of selfridges department store london in january 2002 .
they are self contained pre-fabricated units with a sitting room / kitchen , bedroom and bathroom .
the idea is to create a comfortable hi-tech living space priced around the six figure mark .
microflats are for first time buyers only and resale will be controlled in some way to avoid excessive profiteering .
sam price microflats have 32 square metres of floor space - around two thirds the size of an average one bedroom flat in the capital .
and interest has been considerable - so far 2,500 have registered an intention to buy even before a single flat has been built .
" microflats are for first time buyers only and it is envisaged that resale will be controlled in some way to avoid excessive profiteering , " ms price said .
the peabody trust has an alternative way to square the affordable housing circle - saving on materials rather than space .
its new development at raines court , near stoke newington in london is a series of ' module flats ' which are constructed in three parts in a factory in york then transported to the site .
" by doing this the time spent on construction is slashed by nearly half .
this makes them affordable " ms perry said .
building bridges stamp duty exemptions apply in some inner city areas and are encouraging developers and housing associations to make us of land which many had turned their back on in the past .
the peabody trust has sought planning permission to build houses on a bridge over the river lea .
the inhabited bridge will be ten stories high and have 92 homes , each flat would be prefabricated and craned into place .
even ikea , famous for its furniture , could soon be moving into the uk property market .
' buy your home ' at ikea be klok -lrb- swedish for live smart -rrb- , ikea 's house building arm , has supplied flat pack kit homes in scandinavia .
the flats are stacked in l-shape blocks and are assembled in groups of six on site by scandinavian fitters .
in scandinavia , the pre-fabricated flats are mostly built of local pine and have large windows and balconies overlooking communal gardens .
a major drawback to ikea 's plans could be the price of land in the uk compared to sweden .
but it is hoped that kit apartments may be available in the south east for under £ 150,000 .

" the rise in exports to asian countries contributed most to the overall trade surplus figure in 2002 , " a finance ministry official said .
the 9.9 trillion yen -lrb- £ 51.4bn ; $ 84bn -rrb- surplus comes after it shrunk by 38.7 % in 2001 .
exports rose 6.4 % to a record level of 52.1 trillion yen , due to record shipments to asian countries , especially china , and strong demand for cars in the us .
but in december , japan 's trade surplus increased by a less-than-expected 19.9 % from a year earlier to 791bn yen , with higher oil prices pushing up the cost of imports .
japan is heavily depended on middle eastern oil and fears of a us war on iraq have pushed crude to above $ 30 per barrel from below $ 23 in mid-november .
export fears " the trade gap was narrower than our forecasts due to a steep rise in imports , mainly because of the rise in oil prices , " said takeshi minami of ufj tsubasa securities .
" the outlook for the domestic economy remains bearish , as today 's figures give clear evidence that exports are falling , " he said .
exports helped drag japan out of its deepest post-war recession last year but growth has stalled since the third quarter of 2002 .
the possibility of war has weakened the dollar significantly against the yen , making japanese exports less competitive .
the yen was trading at about 117.90 yen to the dollar on monday up from about 125 yen in early december .

officials advised patients to contact their gp or to phone nhs direct if they needed advice .
those requiring further assistance were advised to visit other hospitals .
patients admitted by gps continued to be accepted as normal .
the hospital opened on 2 december 2002 , replacing both the neath general hospital and port talbot general hospital .

cabinet approved the sell-off of 34 % of hindustan petroleum to a strategic investor and the floatation of 35.2 % of bharat petroleum on indian and international stock markets , privatisation minister arun shourie said .
the sales , which are expected to raise more than 80bn rupees -lrb- £ 856m ; $ 1.4bn -rrb- , will take place " as soon as possible " , mr shourie said on sunday .
they mark a renewed push to dispose of state assets after political infighting in the government caused the programme to stall .
the government , which planned to raise 120bn rupees by the end of the financial year in march , has only sold 50bn rupees in assets .
plans to sell a controlling stake in state-run national aluminium company -lrb- nalco -rrb- , the country 's second-largest aluminium producer , before the end of the financial year in march have reportedly been shelved .
strategic control the decision to sell the oil companies was postponed in september due to objections from petroleum minister ram naik and defence minister george fernandes who said they were strategic assets .
the government , which holds a 51 % in hindustan petroleum and 66 % of bharat petroleum , will give up direct control of the companies .
royal dutch shell and reliance industries , india 's largest company , are considered as leading bidders for hindustan petroleum .

the american position is quite clear - there will have to be a complete change of attitude by iraq or it will be attacked .
the case against iraq is now being made on two levels - the technical case that they have not co-operated with the inspectors and the larger case that iraq poses a huge threat .
the weapons inspectors ' first full report will be presented on monday both us president george w bush and uk prime minister tony blair are using the " armageddon argument " , saying that they must act in case international terrorists get weapons of mass destruction from iraq .
there is not much which can rationally counter that .
critics can say that saddam hussein represents a completely different strand of arab nationalism from osama bin laden and that no links between them have been found .
but the spectre has been raised .
and it is a major reason why war is so likely .
even the slightest doubt about iraqi compliance will be used as evidence that they can not be trusted .
the us secretary of state , colin powell , said in davos on sunday that iraq had " utterly failed " to co-operate with weapons inspectors . : who backs war ?
where key nations stand on iraq his words matched those used by president bush 's national security adviser condoleezza rice on friday .
she said that iraq was failing to co-operate with the un " in spectacular fashion " .
and both used the phrase : " time is running out . "
key dates 27 jan - first full report on inspections presented to un 29 jan - un discusses report 31 jan - bush meets blair 15 feb - anti-war protests across europe 27 mar - blix submits new report to un next steps in full how much time is that ?
the best guess at the moment is about six weeks .
the united states and britain have accepted that inspections will continue for the moment , but they can afford to be flexible .
many of their big units needed for a war have not yet begun to move .
they can not move quickly and they will not be in position until early to mid-march .
and the un resolutions allow for inspections to go on anyway .
there is no deadline for them to stop .
tony blair has said that inspections could continue for " weeks not months . "
half empty , half full this important week starts with an open security council meeting on monday at which the chief weapons inspectors give their update on the state of the inspections so far .
already , dr hans blix , the head of the un weapons group unmovic , has said publicly that his report will be a " mixed bag " .
the americans and british will seize on this to say that iraq is failing in its obligations under security council resolution 1441 .
france , russia , china and germany and others will counter that there has been progress and that nothing yet justifies an attack .
for one side , the glass will be half empty , for the other , it will be half full .
convincing the unconvinced there will be another , closed , session of the council on wednesday at which dr blix and his colleague dr mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , might well be asked to report again in february .
british officials say that at this stage there will be no moves by the us or uk to introduce a second resolution authorising war .
that will come later .
mr blair said on sunday that " of course we want a second resolution " .
ideally , from the british and american point of view , the inspectors will conclude at some point that iraqi co-operation is not sufficient .
trying to convince an unconvinced world that action is needed is going to be a large part of the us and uk 's task this will then give the us and uk governments a platform on which to build support for a war resolution .
if the inspectors do so conclude , then the argument of the french , russians and germans that the process should be extended for months if necessary will be strengthened .
president bush 's attitude will be evident in the annual state of the union speech to congress on tuesday .
he will undoubtedly rattle his sabre but is not expected to draw it yet .

the centrally-funded national criminal intelligence service had taken some of the strain by initially sifting through the names to prioritise who they considered were the worst offenders .

" and it is going to take us a long time . "
home office minister hilary benn said the government had implemented measures to protect children from this " horrific form of abuse " .
the centrally-funded national criminal intelligence service had taken some of the strain by initially sifting through the names to prioritise who they considered were the worst offenders .
and part of the role of the national hi-tech crime unit , set up at a cost of £ 25m , was to support police forces by giving technical expertise .
mr benn added : " police forces have had a big increase in funding - 6 % this year , 10 % last year . "
" the police need to get a move on and the government needs to finance it as a matter of urgency " carole howlett , spokeswoman on internet child pornography for acpo deputy assistant commissioner carole howlett , spokeswoman on internet child pornography for the association of chief police officers , last year asked for more police resources to help .
ms shipley said £ 500,000 had been given , but the police needed about £ 2m to tackle the huge scale of the problem .
" the police need to get a move on and the government needs to finance it as a matter of urgency , " she said .
donald findlater was manager of the wolvercote clinic in surrey - the only residential treatment centre in england for paedophiles , until its closure last year . "
i doubt the system will be able to deal competently , and in a way that protects children , as these people go through the system " former manager of the wolvercote clinic , donald findlater he told the programme : " operation ore has presented enormous challenges which are currently being faced by the police in terms of properly investigating and accumulating evidence .
" the next challenge will be faced by the courts and probation service and maybe the prisons .
" we are going to see this large bulge of this group of individuals going through the system .
" and frankly i doubt the system will be able to deal competently , and in a way that protects children , as these people go through the system . "

two pipelines near sui in balochistan province , 700 kilometres -lrb- 435 miles -rrb- south-west of islamabad , were struck on sunday night . "
we expect gas supplies to be normal within the next 24 to 36 hours " gas company official some reports said it was another rocket attack , others that explosives were used .

"
in economic terms , a short war is better than no war , or no regime change , because of the removal of uncertainty " iod report it set out a range of scenarios between the west and iraq and looked at the effects each would have on the world 's leading economy .
the study concluded that a prolonged gulf war could send oil prices soaring to $ 80 a barrel , make the us stock market fall by 30 % and the country 's gross domestic product shrink by 2 % .
but the iod said this scenario was unlikely .
it thought a short , successful war was most probable and said that would result in oil prices quickly falling back by about a third to $ 20 a barrel and the us economy growing by 2.9 % this year .

but he said : " the economic conclusion is that economic growth will be higher this year in the united states if there is a short war .
he said that was because oil prices would fall more quickly and it would be easier for president bush to get congressional approval for his recently announced package of tax cuts .
lower oil prices would also give the us federal reserve a further opportunity to cut interest rates .

" the two-year recession has been very difficult for the industry and i do n't think anyone clearly sees what the results are going to be for the next 12 months . "
the company is now investing in wireless technology which it hopes will help boost sales .
intel makes chips and other components for computers , so is closely watched as an indicator of how the technology sector as a whole is faring .

faced with declining demand for computers and competition from other chip makers , he has steered the company beyond the desktop with an aggressive move into the communications market .
intel chips moving beyond computers " intel is focusing on both the computing sector and the communications sector and that includes everything from telecoms infrastructure to handheld devices like cellphones and pocket pc devices , " he said .
the company has invested $ 9bn in building up a communications business during possibly the worst period in the history of the telecoms industry .

" all of these devices are easily attachable to a pc and you can download and edit the content on a pc . "

you 've seen a change in the way people use computers , with the increasing use of things like digital cameras and mp3 players " craig barrett , intel ceo " the wireless capability qualifies as broadband , is very easy to set up and it is going to have immediate uses for business travellers .
but it will migrate into the home for home networking very rapidly . "
mr barrett was touting intel 's wireless direction at the consumer electronics show , recently held in las vegas .
other companies like sony and microsoft are also looking to wi-fi in the home as a way of bringing the consumer electronics and technology world together .
intel hopes this trend will ensure the computer plays a key role in the home .
" you 've seen a change in the way people use computers , with the increasing use of things like digital cameras and mp3 players , " said mr barrett .
" all of these devices are easily attachable to a pc and you can download and edit the content on a pc . "
" with the sort of networking capability that we are talking about , you can take that content off the pc easily and put it on your tv set , on your stereo system or other devices in the home . "

his comment was made as a report from the uk 's institute of directors -lrb- iod -rrb- suggested that a successful short , sharp war against iraq would be the best outcome for the us economy .
' tell the truth ' the study concluded that a prolonged gulf war could send oil prices soaring to $ 80 a barrel , make the us stock market fall by 30 % and the country 's gross domestic product shrink by 2 % .

on sunday , us secretary of state , colin powell told business and political leaders at the world economic forum , in switzerland , that saddam " should tell the truth and tell the truth now " .
in the uk , mr blair acknowledged that the british public could not see an immediate threat from iraq , but he argued that it was only a matter of time before international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction came together .
full access mr blair told bbc 's breakfast with frost that a peaceful outcome to the iraq situation rested solely with saddam hussein .
" war is not inevitable , it depends on saddam , " he said .

"
mr blair said the un weapons inspectors " have got to be given the time to do the job " .
" if the inspectors are able to do their job , fine , but if they are not able to do their job , then we have to disarm saddam by force . "
mr blair said the weapons inspectors were " not detectives " and should not be engaged in a " game of hide and seek with saddam " .
the prime minister did not believe it would take the inspectors months to find out whether saddam hussein was co-operating or not , " but they should have whatever time they need " .
terror link he indicated that the kind of weapons of mass destruction that are being made and hidden in iraq , were the sort of weapons that are being traded across international barriers .
the only way war would take place without a second un mandate was if the inspectors reported that saddam was refusing to co-operate and a member of the security council exercised its right of veto , he said .
mr blair defended his decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the us on iraq .
" i think when america is taking on these tough and difficult questions , our job is to be there - not be there at any price ... not simply there as fair-weather friends , " he said .

lobsang dhondup , 28 , was executed on sunday in a move which is sure to trigger strong condemnations of china 's human rights record .
activists have criticised the trial of lobsang dhondup and tibetan monk tenzin deleg rinpoche as unfair .
their case was also raised by us assistant secretary of state lorne craner when he visited china in december .
since the trial , it has come to light that china has arrested 10 more tibetans in connection with a bombing campaign in south-west china .
lobsang dhondup did not appeal against his conviction .
china said he confessed to being involved in the 1998-2002 bombings .
the court said two of the attacks were carried out in the region of ganzi , near tibet 's eastern border .
another attack in april 2002 on sichuan province 's capital , chengdu , left one person dead .
closed trial thierry dodin , director of the london-based tibet information network -lrb- tin -rrb- , said that there was no way of knowing whether lobsang dhondup was guilty because he did not have an open trial .
" these are not the conditions that are favourable for trust given that we know that in many human rights issues , the chinese state has not been straightforward , mr dodin told bbc news online .
he said that china 's official news agency , xinhua , reporting lobsang dhondup 's conviction on sunday , said that the trial had to be closed because it involved state secrets .
" this is , to say the least of course , fishy , " said mr dodin .
" on the one hand china seems keen on being better respected on human rights records , but if people are tried on this business ... then we are back where we were 20 years ago , " he said .
plea of innocence the court also upheld a suspended death sentence for tenzin deleg rinpoche .
tenzin deleg rinpoche , 52 , had appealed against his conviction .
last week a us government-financed radio network broadcast a tape smuggled out of china in which he protested his innocence .
" i was wrongly accused because i have always been sincere and devoted to the interests and well-being of tibetans , " radio free asia quoted him as saying .
" the chinese did not like what i did and what i said .
that is the only reason why i was arrested . "
tenzin deleg rinpoche 's death sentence was suspended for two years .
correspondents say such sentences are usually commuted to life imprisonment .
restive area the town of ganzi has faced repeated crackdowns by chinese police trying to root out pro-independence activists .
the area has a majority ethnic-tibetan population and has long been a hotbed of pro-tibetan independence activity .
western sichuan was originally known as cham and was historically part of tibet .
after the communists came to power in china in 1949 , they amalgamated cham into sichuan province .
in 1951 , china 's people 's liberation army invaded and occupied the rest of tibet .

every year , the former binman travels all over the country to track down local waste tips and work on the dustcarts for free .
steve 's eccentric hobby has taken him as far afield as the lake district , south wales , cornwall , lancashire , kent , sussex and the isles of scilly .
steve , 40 , who left the waste industry in 2001 and is now a self-employed gardener , said : " people think i have a strange hobby but nothing comes close to the thrill of riding in a dustcart .
put simply my life revolves around dustcarts .
bachelor steve jones " it 's wonderful watching them in action .
even if i ca n't join in i love seeing them crush the waste and dump it at the tip .
" put simply my life revolves around dustcarts . "
every summer for 17 years , steve took a holiday at shanklin on the isle of wight just so he could join in with dustmen there .
his love of the island 's refuse rounds eventually persuaded him to move there from west london .
now bachelor steve has got hold of two dustcarts and is restoring them in an old barn near his home in lake .
phil webb , a supervisor for island waste services , said steve was well known among dustcart crews on the isle of wight .
he said : " everyone has known him for years as he used to come and join in the rounds wearing orange overalls - our lads wear green .

after weeks of campaigning , the winner is unable to rest on his laurels and take up residence in the prime minister 's office .
the end of the election marks the beginning of the coalition poker game .
governments in israel are always coalitions , because no one party ever wins an outright majority .
whoever wins knows he must spend the next few weeks negotiating with his former opponents to form a ruling coalition .
if he wins , sharon will have an uphill struggle forming a coalition forming a new government takes great skill to weigh the demands and conditions of individual parties .
a coalition must be strong enough to survive the inevitable disagreements over government policy .
the last three governments all collapsed earlier than expected because the coalitions broke down .
after the last parliamentary election in 1999 , the largest party in the knesset -lsb- the israeli parliament -rsb- was labour , with only 26 of the 120 seats available .
the government must have the support of at least 61 seats - a majority of the knesset .
influence the task is made harder because the electoral system in israel encourages a lot of parties .
it also enables the smaller and medium sized parties to wield considerable power in the pre-coalition discussions .
they will negotiate hard to gain as many ministerial positions as possible - the more power they have in the new cabinet , the greater their ability to influence the government 's decisions .
will labour 's mitzna stick to his policy of not joining a sharon-led coalition the difficulty for the new prime minister is to balance all these factors .
after the collapse of the coalition last autumn , ariel sharon risked his political future by deciding to call early elections .
the prime minister could have made a new deal with other parties , but he declared that he was not willing " to surrender to political blackmail from any party . "
the task of forming the government is given by the president to the leader of the largest party .
opinion polls suggest this will be mr sharon , who also leads the likud party .
he was elected prime minister in direct elections in 2001 and formed the largest cabinet in israel 's history , balancing parties that ranged from the centre left to the ultra-nationalist , from the secular to the ultra-orthodox .
so the key question is who will mr sharon invite into his coalition , assuming the polls are correct and he wins on tuesday ?
there are various possible combinations : national unity government : this is ariel sharon 's preferred option and reflects his previous government , uniting the centre-left labour party with right-wing and religious parties .
right coalition : this would be a significant shift to the right , with the likud party joined by the ultra-nationalist parties like the national union , and the religious parties like shas .
secular coalition : a combination of what are expected to be the three largest parties in the knesset - likud , labour and the secular shinui party .
analysts suggest the national unity government is the most likely , although that depends very much on the labour party .
labour was in government for nearly two years until it quit last autumn , sparking the crisis that led to the early elections .
its new leader , amram mitzna , has vowed not to join any government led by mr sharon .
however there are members of his party who do want to rejoin the government .
