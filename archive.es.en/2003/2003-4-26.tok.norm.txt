the actions have been condemned by governments and human rights groups around the world .
mr castro said he was acting to prevent an attempt by us president george w bush to provoke a war with cuba .
in a defiant three-and-a-half hour speech , the cuban president gave his first full response to the extraordinary events here over the last five weeks .
everything was blamed on the united states .
america , he said , was trying to destabilise cuba , to provide an excuse for military intervention .
the 75 dissidents that have recently been imprisoned here he describes as mercenaries in the pay of the enemy .
the hijacking eventually ended with no one hurt president castro also said that the spate of recent hijackings in cuba was all part of a sinister attempt by the us to encourage a mass exodus .
much of his speech was spent defending the decision to execute three hijackers who attempted to take a ferry boat to florida earlier this month .
that ended a three-year moratorium on capital punishment in cuba and prompted an outpouring of world criticism .
he said it was a decision he would take again .
he said the alternative might be war with his northern neighbour , and in that case , millions of cubans would die .

asda was first to announce a cut of 1p a litre from saturday morning , a move swiftly followed by tesco and safeway .
sainsbury 's said it would match reductions on a local basis .
the cuts comes just a week after many supermarkets and the major petrol companies reduced their prices by between 1p and 2p a litre .
the latest fall in prices was welcomed by motoring organisations as a step in the right direction .
richard freeman , of the aa , said : " there was lot of concern that the price of petrol would increase in the run up to conflict in the gulf so the fact it is falling is very positive .
" it is also typical of the supermarkets to be leading the way in the uk .
" since they entered the petrol market in the mid 80s they have consistently been the cheapest . "
crude price the end of the iraq war has been cited as one of the reasons for the cut in forecourt prices in britain .
the average price of crude oil has fallen from around 30 dollars a barrel earlier this year to about 24 dollars a barrel on friday .
an asda spokesman said : " we wanted to pass on the continuing fall in the price of crude to our customers as soon as possible . "
a safeway spokeswoman added : " the cut reflects the lower costs that we are receiving from the petrol companies . "
two of the major petrol giants , esso and bp , said they would continue to monitor prices locally and lower them where necessary .

such stones , also known as conflict diamonds , are thought to have financed violent civil conflicts in african countries including angola , sierra leone and dr congo .
" conflict diamonds have been used by rebel groups in africa to finance their atrocities committed on civilian populations and their insurrections against internationally recognised governments , " mr bush said .
the new law provides the means for the united states to implement the kimberley process , a certification scheme which went into effect in january and aims to track each diamond from mine to shop window .
the trade in blood diamonds is thought to comprise about 3 % of the annual global diamond trade , said to be worth about $ 7bn .
more than 50 diamond importing and exporting countries have signed up to the scheme , but the participation of the us is crucial as americans buy two-thirds of the world 's supply .
campaigners say diamond sales in africa have funded civil war the clean diamond trade act requires all batches of diamonds to be accompanied by a special hard-to-forge document produced by national authorities to certify the country of origin .
within the us , dealers are required to maintain records of all shipments for inspection .
the kimberly process has the backing of diamond industry representatives and human rights groups as well as governments .
however , some rights groups have expressed concerns that the process lacks proper oversight of national registration schemes .
participant nations are scheduled to meet next week in johannesburg , south africa .

the paris appeals court confirmed that general paul aussaresses , 84 , must pay a fine of 7,500 euros -lrb- $ 8,300 -rrb- - the punishment handed down by a criminal court in january last year .
aussaresses admitted torturing and killing 24 algerian prisoners-of-war in a book he published in 2001 about the conflict .
the general criticised the latest ruling and vowed to continue the legal challenge against his conviction .
the appeals court said that throughout the book , special services , algeria 1955-1957 , aussaresses " repeatedly justifies torture and summary executions " .
under the terms of a post-war amnesty , the general could not be tried for war crimes , and human rights groups campaigned for prosecution on a charge of being an apologist for war crimes .
the appeals court also upheld fine of 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 16,600 dollars -rrb- against two of aussaresses ' publishers , for " failing to distance themselves " from the contents of the book .
aussaresses said friday 's ruling was " stupid " .
he added that he had " neither remorse nor regrets " and would appeal to france 's highest criminal court .
the decision was welcomed by the french anti-racism group mrap - which helped bring the case against aussaresses .
" it 's a victory that is a credit to france , " a mrap spokesman said .
stripped of honour in the book aussaresses says torture can be a legitimate way of extracting information .
the algerian war of independence of 1954-1962 was a brutal conflict in which both sides are known to have committed atrocities .
but the general 's account was the first by a senior french officer which admitted that the use of torture was commonplace .
aussaresses also says that the government of the day was not only aware of the atrocities , but also approved them .
he said late french president francois mitterrand , who was then justice minister , received daily updates by telephone from another general .
aussaresses , a one-eyed hero of the resistance against the nazis , was stripped of his legion d 'honneur - one of france 's top merit awards - after the book appeared .

by jon leyne bbc state department correspondent tariq aziz : even his status is in question while the united states vigorously searches for former members of the iraqi regime , it still has not decided what to do with those it has caught .
one thing is certain .
the americans will not send them to the international criminal court or set up any new international tribunal .
that is something to which the bush administration is ideologically opposed .
instead , us officials have said that american military or civilian courts will deal with those accused of crimes against american citizens .
that would cover mostly war crimes , but it is unlikely to apply to civilian leaders like tariq aziz .
the us has not even decided whether he is a prisoner of war or not .
technically he is just in custody and being questioned for information .
' tragic mistake ' the official policy is that the us will help set up new iraqi courts to try leaders accused of crimes against their own people .
that has already brought loud protests , not just from human rights groups , but from members of congress .
leading democratic senator joe biden said recently that it would be a tragic mistake for the us not to set up an international court .
the other question is where to hold suspects .
there are still hundreds of detainees from the afghan conflict at the american base at guantanamo bay , cuba - but few iraqi prisoners of war are likely to be sent there .
in fact , according to the geneva convention , most prisoners of war should be released at the end of the conflict , but at the moment the bush administration is still feeling its way through this complicated legal situation .
