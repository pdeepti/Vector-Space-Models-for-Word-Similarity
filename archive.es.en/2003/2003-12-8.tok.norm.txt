plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

" this is a question on which we are not movable " , he said .
the comments came after a meeting with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in berlin .
berlusconi said he is only " 55 percent optimistic " that european leaders can agree on the eu constitution when they meet in brussels later this week .
the german government continued to back what was set out by the eu convention , which drafted a constitution under the leadership of former french president valéry giscard d ’ estaing .
the convention proposed a new double majority voting system in the european union where decisions can be taken if backed by at least half the eu states , representing at least 60 percent of the eu population .
member states , both current and future , have agreed on a great deal of the draft constitution produced by the convention , but are still at loggerheads over other major points .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
while washington remained tight-lipped , deutsche welle readers had much to say . it is time now for europe to become independent and not a puppet of the imperial designs of some people in washington .

it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?

the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .

in an interview on dutch public television on sunday , dutch state secretary for european affairs , atzo nicolaï demanded that the new constitution include expanded powers for the european court of justice over the stability pact – the rules that underpin the euro .
according to mr nicolaï , an increase of power of the european court of justice would avoid further ' political fiddling ' with the stability pact by big member states .
this would be a ' very important ' point for the netherlands in the negotiations on the eu constitution , he added .
france and germany , two countries that are formally in breach of the stability pact rules , escaped fines from the european commission last month following a majority decision by the finance ministers from the euro zone -lrb- the 12 countries that share the euro -rrb- .the dutch government considered taking france and germany to the court of justice , but decided it did not have a strong enough case under the present euro pact rules .
it now wants these powers enhanced .

the european commission has now given them two months to provide an explanation .
belgium , germany , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden have not been able to implement the directive banning e-mail spam .
if they fail to respond to the commission within the required two months , they could face possible court action .
the main idea of the law is to reduce internet fraud and protect people getting unwanted e-mail .
almost half of the e-mails people receive in europe are spam , according to commission research conducted earlier this year .
it is urgent that member states adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited emails , the use of location data or cookies " , said erkki liikanen , commissioner for enterprise and the information society . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector " , he added .

russian president vladimir putin hailed his allies ’ victory in parliamentary polls as a boost to democracy .
critics say the pro-kremlin majority spells the death of democracy in russia .
were the results made to order ? vladimir putin should be very satisfied with the democracy he ’ s engineered : parties that he more or less controls will certainly occupy more than two-thirds of all the seats in the new duma . and with that , putin technically has the ability to alter the country ’ s constitution . he will most likely make use of that ability to run for a third term in office in 2008 - something the constitution currently forbids . sunday ’ s parliamentary elections practically guarantee that putin will be returned to office with an overwhelming majority in upcoming presidential poll scheduled for march 2004 . death of democracy ?
what do elections in russia have to do with democracy ? the short answer is : very little , as the winners seem preordained . putin ’ s own party , united russia , is a good example . the president ’ s political followers had all the might of the state apparatus behind them , not to mention the support of numerous governors and local mayors . at the government ’ s expense , putin ’ s emissaries flew from constituency to constituency .
the state-steered propaganda machine , and especially state-run television , showed the united russia candidates in the best light , while at the same time , their opponents were either talked down or completely ignored by the broadcast media . putin ’ s main opposition - the communists - bore the brunt of such treatment , losing half of their percentage of the vote . this weakening of lenin ’ s party was obviously one of the kremlin ’ s strategic goals . contributing to this goal was the creation of the motherland party under the leadership of the rhetorically gifted economist sergei glazev , who was once in the communist party leadership . thanks to the support of the presidential apparatus , motherland was able to jump the fiver-percent hurdle the first time around the track . glazev ’ s gains were , in the end , the communists ’ losses . the same applies to the amazingly good results for vladimir zhirinovsky . his liberal democratic party - a group that ’ s neither liberal nor democratic , but ultra-nationalistic - got almost as many votes as the communists . neither of the small democratic parties , yabloko and the union of right-wing forces , managed to secure any seats in parliament . many voters appeared to have punished yabloko ’ s leader , grigory yavlinsky , for the fact that his party received financial backing from former yukos oil company chief mikhail khodorkovsky , who has since been arrested on fraud and tax-evasion charges . there seemed to be little understanding among voters for the failure of both democratic parties to unite . yavlinsky , a popular figure in the west , is now facing the prospect of political obscurity . parliament obsolete what political role will this duma play in the years to come ? it might sound odd to western ears , but in russia ’ s controlled democracy , it will play only a very minor role . bills will mostly come from the presidential apparatus , be revised by the parliamentary floor leaders , and be given a final blessing by parliament . large debates , as could be heard in the duma of the 1990 ’ s , won ’ t be taking place . the parliament isn ’ t there to keep tabs on the presidential powers or the government - it ’ s the other way around .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .

nato is just the alliance the usa needs to control eu nations militarily .
it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?
i would like to see that .
the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .
as dangerous as the usa has become since then . - antonio peramo , spain .

nato is simply a puppet of the us .
unless the eu takes a bold initiative here the us will cement pax america around the globe . - robert f. scheyder , germany .
i think that it does appear that nato has been seriously weakened .
i believe that is was the bush administration who dealt it the most serious blow , however , by its insistence on its own plans regarding iraq and the middle east .
the confidence , the trust implicit in partnership , has been severely violated .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
while washington remained tight-lipped , deutsche welle readers had much to say . it is time now for europe to become independent and not a puppet of the imperial designs of some people in washington .
nato is just the alliance the usa needs to control eu nations militarily .
it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?
i would like to see that .
the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .

the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington .

-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .

“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .

large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .

the european commission has now given them two months to provide an explanation .
belgium , germany , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden have not been able to implement the directive banning e-mail spam .
if they fail to respond to the commission within the required two months , they could face possible court action .
the main idea of the law is to reduce internet fraud and protect people getting unwanted e-mail .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
while washington remained tight-lipped , deutsche welle readers had much to say . it is time now for europe to become independent and not a puppet of the imperial designs of some people in washington .
nato is just the alliance the usa needs to control eu nations militarily .
it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?
i would like to see that .
the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .
as dangerous as the usa has become since then . - antonio peramo , spain .
the eu military force is needed to supply a counterweight to the us in the world .
nato is simply a puppet of the us .
unless the eu takes a bold initiative here the us will cement pax america around the globe . - robert f. scheyder , germany .
i think that it does appear that nato has been seriously weakened .
i believe that is was the bush administration who dealt it the most serious blow , however , by its insistence on its own plans regarding iraq and the middle east .
the confidence , the trust implicit in partnership , has been severely violated .
it 's remarkable , therefore , that the bush administration shows so much anger about the euro defense plans .
another facet of the widening division is the success that the militant zionist lobby in the states is having in isolating the usa from its former allies . - dominique amarante , country not supplied . i think it is a great idea for the eu .
maybe it will hasten the day that the us can get the monetary support off the us tax payers back and have the ride free euer 's assume some responsibily other than the feeble monies they appropriate from their gnp 's .
i 'm for the us pulling out of nato now , not in a few years .
the eu will , as is their habit , keep the us as long as it takes to reach their objectives .
the eu is the trojan horse .
us out of nato . - richard ross , usa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato mulls eu defense plans eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
but criticism from washington remains subdued .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .

russian president vladimir putin hailed his allies ’ victory in parliamentary polls as a boost to democracy .
critics say the pro-kremlin majority spells the death of democracy in russia .
were the results made to order ? vladimir putin should be very satisfied with the democracy he ’ s engineered : parties that he more or less controls will certainly occupy more than two-thirds of all the seats in the new duma . and with that , putin technically has the ability to alter the country ’ s constitution . he will most likely make use of that ability to run for a third term in office in 2008 - something the constitution currently forbids . sunday ’ s parliamentary elections practically guarantee that putin will be returned to office with an overwhelming majority in upcoming presidential poll scheduled for march 2004 . death of democracy ?
what do elections in russia have to do with democracy ? the short answer is : very little , as the winners seem preordained . putin ’ s own party , united russia , is a good example . the president ’ s political followers had all the might of the state apparatus behind them , not to mention the support of numerous governors and local mayors . at the government ’ s expense , putin ’ s emissaries flew from constituency to constituency .
the state-steered propaganda machine , and especially state-run television , showed the united russia candidates in the best light , while at the same time , their opponents were either talked down or completely ignored by the broadcast media . putin ’ s main opposition - the communists - bore the brunt of such treatment , losing half of their percentage of the vote . this weakening of lenin ’ s party was obviously one of the kremlin ’ s strategic goals . contributing to this goal was the creation of the motherland party under the leadership of the rhetorically gifted economist sergei glazev , who was once in the communist party leadership . thanks to the support of the presidential apparatus , motherland was able to jump the fiver-percent hurdle the first time around the track . glazev ’ s gains were , in the end , the communists ’ losses . the same applies to the amazingly good results for vladimir zhirinovsky . his liberal democratic party - a group that ’ s neither liberal nor democratic , but ultra-nationalistic - got almost as many votes as the communists . neither of the small democratic parties , yabloko and the union of right-wing forces , managed to secure any seats in parliament . many voters appeared to have punished yabloko ’ s leader , grigory yavlinsky , for the fact that his party received financial backing from former yukos oil company chief mikhail khodorkovsky , who has since been arrested on fraud and tax-evasion charges . there seemed to be little understanding among voters for the failure of both democratic parties to unite . yavlinsky , a popular figure in the west , is now facing the prospect of political obscurity . parliament obsolete what political role will this duma play in the years to come ? it might sound odd to western ears , but in russia ’ s controlled democracy , it will play only a very minor role . bills will mostly come from the presidential apparatus , be revised by the parliamentary floor leaders , and be given a final blessing by parliament . large debates , as could be heard in the duma of the 1990 ’ s , won ’ t be taking place . the parliament isn ’ t there to keep tabs on the presidential powers or the government - it ’ s the other way around .
the actual politics of russia won ’ t be discussed in the parliamentary chambers , but rather in the back rooms of the kremlin . small wonder that few russians view the role of parliament with respect - that probably explains why only every second russian went out to vote . the fact is , putin emerges from the parliamentary vote much stronger than he was before . but his victory has dealt a blow to russian democracy , and his style of governing is a burden on civil society . on the evening of the election , putin ’ s predecessor , boris yeltsin spoke out .
he warned against putin and the pro- kremlin bloc becoming too powerful , saying that , just like in communist times , the situation could get out of control . and who could know the potential threat to russia ’ s democracy better than yeltsin , the conquerer of moscow ’ s totalitarian regime . miodrag soric send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-kremlin party tastes victory russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year .
-lrb- dec.07 , 2003 -rrb- kremlin-backed party aims for two-thirds majority russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .
the proposal had created tension with washington .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .
with only a slim majority in the lower house of parliament , many anaylsts say he can ill-afford to upset his junior coalition partners . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " german weapons for the red mandarins " german newspapers commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to china and his controversial calls for lifting a weapons embargo and offering to sell a plutonium plant . -lrb- dec.04 , 2003 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .

schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .

“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .

large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .

the european commission has now given them two months to provide an explanation .
belgium , germany , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden have not been able to implement the directive banning e-mail spam .
if they fail to respond to the commission within the required two months , they could face possible court action .
the main idea of the law is to reduce internet fraud and protect people getting unwanted e-mail .
almost half of the e-mails people receive in europe are spam , according to commission research conducted earlier this year .
it is urgent that member states adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited emails , the use of location data or cookies " , said erkki liikanen , commissioner for enterprise and the information society . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector " , he added .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
while washington remained tight-lipped , deutsche welle readers had much to say . it is time now for europe to become independent and not a puppet of the imperial designs of some people in washington .
nato is just the alliance the usa needs to control eu nations militarily .
it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?
i would like to see that .
the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .
as dangerous as the usa has become since then . - antonio peramo , spain .
the eu military force is needed to supply a counterweight to the us in the world .
nato is simply a puppet of the us .
unless the eu takes a bold initiative here the us will cement pax america around the globe . - robert f. scheyder , germany .
i think that it does appear that nato has been seriously weakened .
i believe that is was the bush administration who dealt it the most serious blow , however , by its insistence on its own plans regarding iraq and the middle east .
the confidence , the trust implicit in partnership , has been severely violated .
it 's remarkable , therefore , that the bush administration shows so much anger about the euro defense plans .
another facet of the widening division is the success that the militant zionist lobby in the states is having in isolating the usa from its former allies . - dominique amarante , country not supplied . i think it is a great idea for the eu .
maybe it will hasten the day that the us can get the monetary support off the us tax payers back and have the ride free euer 's assume some responsibily other than the feeble monies they appropriate from their gnp 's .
i 'm for the us pulling out of nato now , not in a few years .
the eu will , as is their habit , keep the us as long as it takes to reach their objectives .
the eu is the trojan horse .

eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .
while washington remained tight-lipped , deutsche welle readers had much to say . it is time now for europe to become independent and not a puppet of the imperial designs of some people in washington .
nato is just the alliance the usa needs to control eu nations militarily .
it is a shame that eu nations , fifty years after wwii still have in their territories hundreds of thousands of us troops and lots of military bases .
what do you think of germany and france having 10,000 troops stationed near washington dc ?
i would like to see that .
the us troops were stationed in europe because of the war , created by dangerous and unstable countries .
as dangerous as the usa has become since then . - antonio peramo , spain .
the eu military force is needed to supply a counterweight to the us in the world .
nato is simply a puppet of the us .
unless the eu takes a bold initiative here the us will cement pax america around the globe . - robert f. scheyder , germany .
i think that it does appear that nato has been seriously weakened .
i believe that is was the bush administration who dealt it the most serious blow , however , by its insistence on its own plans regarding iraq and the middle east .
the confidence , the trust implicit in partnership , has been severely violated .
it 's remarkable , therefore , that the bush administration shows so much anger about the euro defense plans .

russian president vladimir putin hailed his allies ’ victory in parliamentary polls as a boost to democracy .
critics say the pro-kremlin majority spells the death of democracy in russia .
were the results made to order ? vladimir putin should be very satisfied with the democracy he ’ s engineered : parties that he more or less controls will certainly occupy more than two-thirds of all the seats in the new duma . and with that , putin technically has the ability to alter the country ’ s constitution . he will most likely make use of that ability to run for a third term in office in 2008 - something the constitution currently forbids . sunday ’ s parliamentary elections practically guarantee that putin will be returned to office with an overwhelming majority in upcoming presidential poll scheduled for march 2004 . death of democracy ?
what do elections in russia have to do with democracy ? the short answer is : very little , as the winners seem preordained . putin ’ s own party , united russia , is a good example . the president ’ s political followers had all the might of the state apparatus behind them , not to mention the support of numerous governors and local mayors . at the government ’ s expense , putin ’ s emissaries flew from constituency to constituency .
the state-steered propaganda machine , and especially state-run television , showed the united russia candidates in the best light , while at the same time , their opponents were either talked down or completely ignored by the broadcast media . putin ’ s main opposition - the communists - bore the brunt of such treatment , losing half of their percentage of the vote . this weakening of lenin ’ s party was obviously one of the kremlin ’ s strategic goals . contributing to this goal was the creation of the motherland party under the leadership of the rhetorically gifted economist sergei glazev , who was once in the communist party leadership . thanks to the support of the presidential apparatus , motherland was able to jump the fiver-percent hurdle the first time around the track . glazev ’ s gains were , in the end , the communists ’ losses . the same applies to the amazingly good results for vladimir zhirinovsky . his liberal democratic party - a group that ’ s neither liberal nor democratic , but ultra-nationalistic - got almost as many votes as the communists . neither of the small democratic parties , yabloko and the union of right-wing forces , managed to secure any seats in parliament . many voters appeared to have punished yabloko ’ s leader , grigory yavlinsky , for the fact that his party received financial backing from former yukos oil company chief mikhail khodorkovsky , who has since been arrested on fraud and tax-evasion charges . there seemed to be little understanding among voters for the failure of both democratic parties to unite . yavlinsky , a popular figure in the west , is now facing the prospect of political obscurity . parliament obsolete what political role will this duma play in the years to come ? it might sound odd to western ears , but in russia ’ s controlled democracy , it will play only a very minor role . bills will mostly come from the presidential apparatus , be revised by the parliamentary floor leaders , and be given a final blessing by parliament . large debates , as could be heard in the duma of the 1990 ’ s , won ’ t be taking place . the parliament isn ’ t there to keep tabs on the presidential powers or the government - it ’ s the other way around .
the actual politics of russia won ’ t be discussed in the parliamentary chambers , but rather in the back rooms of the kremlin . small wonder that few russians view the role of parliament with respect - that probably explains why only every second russian went out to vote . the fact is , putin emerges from the parliamentary vote much stronger than he was before . but his victory has dealt a blow to russian democracy , and his style of governing is a burden on civil society . on the evening of the election , putin ’ s predecessor , boris yeltsin spoke out .
he warned against putin and the pro- kremlin bloc becoming too powerful , saying that , just like in communist times , the situation could get out of control . and who could know the potential threat to russia ’ s democracy better than yeltsin , the conquerer of moscow ’ s totalitarian regime . miodrag soric send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-kremlin party tastes victory russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year .

were the results made to order ? vladimir putin should be very satisfied with the democracy he ’ s engineered : parties that he more or less controls will certainly occupy more than two-thirds of all the seats in the new duma . and with that , putin technically has the ability to alter the country ’ s constitution . he will most likely make use of that ability to run for a third term in office in 2008 - something the constitution currently forbids . sunday ’ s parliamentary elections practically guarantee that putin will be returned to office with an overwhelming majority in upcoming presidential poll scheduled for march 2004 . death of democracy ?
what do elections in russia have to do with democracy ? the short answer is : very little , as the winners seem preordained . putin ’ s own party , united russia , is a good example . the president ’ s political followers had all the might of the state apparatus behind them , not to mention the support of numerous governors and local mayors . at the government ’ s expense , putin ’ s emissaries flew from constituency to constituency .
the state-steered propaganda machine , and especially state-run television , showed the united russia candidates in the best light , while at the same time , their opponents were either talked down or completely ignored by the broadcast media . putin ’ s main opposition - the communists - bore the brunt of such treatment , losing half of their percentage of the vote . this weakening of lenin ’ s party was obviously one of the kremlin ’ s strategic goals . contributing to this goal was the creation of the motherland party under the leadership of the rhetorically gifted economist sergei glazev , who was once in the communist party leadership . thanks to the support of the presidential apparatus , motherland was able to jump the fiver-percent hurdle the first time around the track . glazev ’ s gains were , in the end , the communists ’ losses . the same applies to the amazingly good results for vladimir zhirinovsky . his liberal democratic party - a group that ’ s neither liberal nor democratic , but ultra-nationalistic - got almost as many votes as the communists . neither of the small democratic parties , yabloko and the union of right-wing forces , managed to secure any seats in parliament . many voters appeared to have punished yabloko ’ s leader , grigory yavlinsky , for the fact that his party received financial backing from former yukos oil company chief mikhail khodorkovsky , who has since been arrested on fraud and tax-evasion charges . there seemed to be little understanding among voters for the failure of both democratic parties to unite . yavlinsky , a popular figure in the west , is now facing the prospect of political obscurity . parliament obsolete what political role will this duma play in the years to come ? it might sound odd to western ears , but in russia ’ s controlled democracy , it will play only a very minor role . bills will mostly come from the presidential apparatus , be revised by the parliamentary floor leaders , and be given a final blessing by parliament . large debates , as could be heard in the duma of the 1990 ’ s , won ’ t be taking place . the parliament isn ’ t there to keep tabs on the presidential powers or the government - it ’ s the other way around .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .
the foreign ministers of the three countries were able to dissuade iran from covering up its nuclear program and urged it to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany backs down on eu military hq german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday distanced berlin from plans to create eu military headquarters separate from nato .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .

schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .
greens chairman reinhard bütikofer has vowed to use all legal and political options to stop the plutonium plant sale to china .
but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

the european commission has now given them two months to provide an explanation .
belgium , germany , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden have not been able to implement the directive banning e-mail spam .
if they fail to respond to the commission within the required two months , they could face possible court action .
the main idea of the law is to reduce internet fraud and protect people getting unwanted e-mail .
almost half of the e-mails people receive in europe are spam , according to commission research conducted earlier this year .
it is urgent that member states adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited emails , the use of location data or cookies " , said erkki liikanen , commissioner for enterprise and the information society . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector " , he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

but according to the party ’ s parliamentary group leader krista sager , those options are limited . in an interview with germany ’ s zdf television on monday , sager spoke of her frustrations with the chinese deal . germany has laws to regulate the phase-out of nuclear energy at home , she said , but that doesn ’ t prevent companies from selling nuclear plants or components abroad . timing crucial sager expressed regret that chancellor schröder either wasn ’ t able or didn ’ t want to use his influence on siemens to prevent the sale , but said now that siemens and the chinese government are going ahead with the transaction , there ’ s little the greens can do to stop it . however , the hanau issue comes at a sensitive time for the chancellor , who is counting on pushing through major parts of his reform legislation before christmas .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the european commission has now given them two months to provide an explanation .
belgium , germany , greece , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , portugal , finland and sweden have not been able to implement the directive banning e-mail spam .
if they fail to respond to the commission within the required two months , they could face possible court action .
the main idea of the law is to reduce internet fraud and protect people getting unwanted e-mail .
almost half of the e-mails people receive in europe are spam , according to commission research conducted earlier this year .
it is urgent that member states adopt a consistent legislative approach to such issues as unsolicited emails , the use of location data or cookies " , said erkki liikanen , commissioner for enterprise and the information society . " this will strengthen consumer confidence in e-commerce and electronic services , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth in the sector " , he added .

just how big a role will europe fill on the world stage ?
a new european security doctrine attempts to answer that question and forge unity where there has been dissent . as the clock ticks on brussels ' finalization of the eu constitution this week amid wrangling over controversial vote-sharing agreements , the european council will be looking at ironing out several other important issues before the end of the week .
one of these includes the european security doctrine - a paper laying out european strategy on conflict prevention , drawn up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief .
spurred on by divisions over u.s. policy in iraq , european diplomats began working on the document early this year that would present the world a security strategy based on principles of multilateralism and greater action on the world stage .
but as with the draft constitution for a eu that will expand to 25 members in may , the security doctrine has been a matter of heated internal debate recently .
the chief sticking point in the document is a clause on when and how the eu will intervene in conflicts of the future .
the opponents divide along familiar lines . great britain led some eu countries in advocating u.s.-style pre-emptive approach to conflicts that would approve a military strike in order to deter enemies . a matter of wording germany and france , the two main european opponents of the war in iraq , were able to shoot down the clause in negotiations since the first draft was completed . the document now suggests the eu engage in " preventive " not " pre-emptive " intervention in global conflicts .
the wording change is a clear rebuff of the bush administration 's pledge , in their 2002 national security strategy , to use " pre-emptive " force . " there is a fundamental difference between ' pre-emption ' and ' prevention , " ' george schöpflin , professor of political science at london university told the financial times .
" this is about the europeans saying they are not going down the u.s. road . " a foreign policy of eu strengths the document cuts to the heart of the problems the eu has faced in developing a coherent security and foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alek , left , and paulina hold eu and polish flags as they sit in a window in the southern polish town of prudnik .
as the union stands before an expansion to the east and south that will increase its population to 450 million , disputes remain on how to lend some of that weight to a global foreign policy .
in the paper presented to ministers in june of this year , union diplomats agree that the eu 's should utilize a mutifaceted approach in tackling conflicts .
the 25-member bloc 's combined diplomatic , economic , military and political power means it is " particularly well-equipped to respond to such multi-faceted situations , " according to the document . eu military dreaming the deployment of an eu police force in the balkans and eu troops taking over a security mission in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia from nato last year are evidence of the union 's readiness to step-up internationally , argues the paper . but the eu 's continued military reliance on nato and inability to unify or build up its military capabilities have harmed its ability to forge a policy that carries weight against the united states in questions like iraq . the doctrine argues for a more active approach in pooling military resources and a troop force that would allow it " early and … robust intervention . "
the possibility of that happening say observers rests mostly on the shoulders of great britain , france and germany , who recently agreed the eu should have its own military planning abilities outside of nato . the three also showed in recent weeks in iran how the eu 's " preventive " strategy might work .

the summit is overshadowed by russian president vladimir putin 's announcement that his country has no immediate plans to ratify the kyoto protocol , designed to combat global warming .
since the environmental pact needs moscow 's approval to come into force , it is presently in limbo .
despite this , the milan conference has seen an explosion of interest on the part of governmental and non-governmental delegations .
a plethora or side-events is looking at issues such as intelligent transport policies and the responsibility of the developed world to help emerging economies generate clean electricity .
at the heart of many debates is the question of to what extent the rich economies of the world will need to change their extravagant life-styles in order to reduce greenhouse gasses , or whether technological solutions such as fuel-cell cars are the answer .
behind the scenes , the debate over a possible successor agreement to the floundering kyoto treaty is on .

plan could be victim of its own success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-employment could spell an end to the daily search for a job .
the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme . news that 83,000 germans have left the nation ’ s unemployment rolls should be very welcome in a country where 4.18 million are out of work . but in this case , it might be too much of a good thing .
those 83,000 are taking advantage of a program that offers state subsidies to individuals who set up their own small businesses .
but the pace at which people are signing up for the program , known as " ich-ag ” or “ me , inc . ” has some worried . the numbers signing up for the micro-business scheme are surpassing expectations by a factor of four . more applicants than forecasted although on the surface a cause for celebration , by exceeding government forecasts , the new generation of " ich-ag " businesses may begin to put a strain on funds that were initially planned for 20,000 people . the program was launched at the beginning of this year as part of sweeping labor market reforms put forward in august 2002 .
the government provides state subsidies for “ the creation of an individual business ” under the conditions that the applicant be unemployed or the beneficiary of welfare assistance and agrees to work at least 15 hours a week for annual earnings of less than € 25,000 -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- .
the conditions have proved favorable to many jobless people who now supplement their unemployment benefits with earnings from their own business .
the “ ich-ag ” participant received € 600 a month for the first year from the government , € 360 the second and € 240 the third . subsidy costs set to dwarf estimates at the beginning of 2003 , total subsidies for the first year of the program , using the government ’ s initial estimate of 20,000 applicants , were projected at € 1.4 billion .
now , with the number of applicants exceeding 80,000 , the amount of subsidy will reach almost € 6 billion , if not more . ironically , success in lowering the unemployment figures is now in danger of becoming the problem for germany ’ s already strained public coffers and could make it more difficult for the government to keep its escalating budget deficits under control . uncertain future the thinking behind the government project is that " ich-ag " participants do not claim full unemployment benefits and , in time , overall amount of benefits the german government pays out will go down .
businesses set up under the program , if successful , would also aid the economy . but some employment experts warn that success of the micro-enterprises is anything but guaranteed .
the nature of the " ich-ag " agreement does not do enough to advise participants on the possible business pitfalls ahead , neither demanding a detailed business plan from the applicant or explaining the fact that there are very few unfilled niches in the market .
the effect , say some , is that many of the start-ups will fail . " to have an assured minimum earning level for three years is reassuring when making the leap " toward financial independence , said karin denisow , head of the business consulting agency uniue-berlin in an interview with press agency afp .
" but i think the people should be better advised . " although the german economy is showing signs of a rebound , the government is still insisting that there will be no new jobs available for the foreseeable future .
therefore , the collapse of any of the projects set up under the “ ich-ag ” program will leave those entrepreneurs who initially benefited from the scheme with no other option but to return to the queues at the job center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament backs labor reform plans in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .

the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .
but the spd - greens coalition battle is not over yet . as the junior coalition partner with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , germany 's greens have learned a thing or two about compromise in their past five years in government . from the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , to the transport of nuclear waste and setting out a timetable for germany ’ s nuclear phase-out , the greens searched for common ground with the spd on issues close to their heart , and ensured it kept the coalition intact . now , the next such debate , has reared its head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , receives flowers by jennnifer yan , rights , as he arives in beijing , monday , dec.1 , 2003 .
schroeder is on a five-day-trip for political talks in china and kazakhstan .
-lrb- ap photo / andreas altwein , pool -rrb- on his recent trip to china -lrb- photo -rrb- , chancellor gerhard schröder announced a deal for siemens to sell a plutonium processing plant to china .
the plant in hanau , near frankfurt , was mothballed in 1995 without ever being used . the chinese deal is worth an estimated € 50 million . schröder said he had no reason to block the deal as the chinese government had assured him that the plant would not produce material for military purposes . “ the company has a legal right and i am for ensuring that rights and the law are upheld and not – for whatever motivation – for preventing it , ” schröder said . hypocrisy critics both within the greens and the spd have balked at the deal , saying it ’ s the height of hypocrisy for germany – a nation which is working toward the total phase-out of nuclear energy by 2025 – to export nuclear plants or technology abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer the greens are putting pressure on fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's foreign minister and the best-known green party member , to stand up to schröder and clearly represent their desire to stop the deal . the two men are rumoured to have argued about the hanau plant sale on sunday with fischer reportedly accusing schröder of having caused a “ communications disaster ” . according to the handelsblatt newspaper , schröder told fischer that he needed to get the unruly greens back in line . a government spokesperson has denied the reports . schröder standing firm whatever transpired in the meeting , schröder has made it clear that he stands firm in his support for the hanau deal .
but for many in the greens and the spd , that ’ s not good enough .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , the spd ’ s energy expert hermann scheer said that schröder shouldn ’ t feel he ’ s losing face were he to back away from the sale .
for the greens , it ’ s time for the leading party members to flex some political muscle .
“ fischer and the other greens ministers should make our position clear to the chancellor , ” said greens deputy floor leader hans-christian ströbele .
“ i want to see fischer fight , ” said another greens mp , winfried hermann . long-held frustrations such statements echo the frustration among lower-ranking greens politicians and their supporters , that those in the upper echelons of the party have abandoned their roots and sacrificed ecologist and pacifist principles in the pursuit of power .
large gains in popular support for the green party resulted in best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 election – giving the spd and chancellor schröder a much-needed boost and securing his re-election victory . the greens were optimistic that a bigger mandate would give them more say in coalition negotiations , but they could come up empty in the hanau plant dispute .

it says the uk still has the most car crime in europe , costing £ 3.5bn a year and affecting 2.5 million people .
criminals were not being caught because cameras were increasingly replacing traffic police , said the group 's executive director edmund king .
" there should be an absolute increase in the number of police devoted to traffic and road safety work , " he said .
mr king said the crime statistics were " shocking " , considering all new cars were fitted with immobilisers and 45 % fitted with alarms .
" as new cars become more secure thieves target car keys or older vehicles .
car crime in the uk 75 % of vehicle crime offenders have convictions for other types of offences 73 % of vehicle crime offenders have tested positive for illegal drugs car tax evasion costs £ 193m a year 25 % of motorcycles are untaxed , and 2.1m vehicles have no registered keeper source : rac foundation " the real answer is more resources to allow police forces to tackle the problems , " he said .
" millions of pounds are being generated by remote enforcement technology and some of this should be spent on traffic police rather than more cameras .
" police should not be diverted from crime or terrorism but there should be an absolute increase in the number of police devoted to traffic and road safety work .
" if the objective of the cameras is to improve road safety , the rest of the revenue should go into improving dangerous roads . "
' making safety worse ' controversy has been raging in recent weeks over whether speed cameras actually make roads safer .
some campaigners suspect police forces - who since 2001 have been able to keep revenue from speed cameras - have used them to make money , rather than in a serious attempt to tackle road safety .
the cause of accidents is clearly something different than exceeding the speed limit and we ought to be looking at those other factors durham chief constable paul garvin in the sunday telegraph on sunday durham chief constable paul garvin said he had refused to install speed cameras because they did not work .
he told the sunday telegraph accidents were almost always caused by other factors , especially drink-driving or drug-driving .
instead of installing speed cameras , he has embarked on an intensive education campaign among youths and those involved in accidents - and claims durham has 34 % fewer road accidents than the national average .
casualties reduced a motoring group argued last week that speed cameras had actually made road safety worse .
the association of british drivers said cameras meant only the issue of speeding was addressed , while other offences were going unnoticed or unpunished .
it added that most cameras were on major a roads , while drivers felt free to speed through schools and villages .
but road safety charity brake insisted there had been a 36 % reduction in casualties at spots where speed cameras were sited .

one in three said they had driven after drinking two units of alcohol , and 10 % had driven after drinking three .
one in 10 motorists admitted to drink-driving once a month or more often .
the survey , by road safety charity brake for green flag motoring assistance , comes as the christmas anti-drink drive campaign begins .
this year , the government is re-running a tv advert used earlier this year , showing a young female cyclist being involved in a crash with a drink-driver .
in the brake survey , a quarter admitted to drink-driving even when they knew the alcohol was affecting their driving .
and 28 % said that they had risked driving first thing in the morning after drinking a lot of alcohol the night before .
alcohol content standard -lrb- 175ml -rrb- glass of wine - 2 units large -lrb- 250ml -rrb- glass of wine - 3 units pint of standard lager - 2.3 units pint of premium lager - 2.8 units pint of strong cider - 4.7 units the survey also showed that motorists had a poor grasp of alcohol units and the law .
the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood , but this can not easily be translated into alcohol units as it can be affected by build , sex , whether food has been eaten , and a host of other factors .
half of those questioned mistakenly thought that two 25 ml shots of vodka were more alcoholic than a pint of 5.8 % -strength lager .
the real answer is that the lager is about three units , while the vodka is about two units .
just over half wrongly thought it would take two or more units to affect their driving , while 8 % reckoned it would take four or more units .
the real answer is that any amount of alcohol affects driving ability , and there is no safe limit .
' lethal ignorance ' many thought there was a relatively small chance of being caught drinking and driving .
brake 's chief executive mary williams said : " the war against drink-drivers has not been won .
the findings highlight a lethal ignorance of drink-drive law and the effects of drink driving , and widespread levels of drink-driving .
" drivers should never drink and drive - not even one . "
understanding units it is no longer accurate to say one glass of wine is 1 unit a large glass could easily be 3.25 units a pint of strong 8 % lager could easily be 4.5 units how many units is your drink ?
drink-drive deaths have fallen dramatically over the last 20 years , but have been edging up recently .
there were an estimated 560 deaths in the uk last year - 6 % more than in 2001 .
road safety minister david jamieson said : " drink-drivers are still killing people .
" if you are going out and enjoying yourself over christmas , do n't turn your night into a nightmare .
" leave the car at home and , if you ca n't use public transport , designate a non-drinking driver .
remember that you could still be over the limit in the morning after a good night out . "
the aa motoring trust called for similar campaigns all year round .
a spokesman said : " people know that drink-driving is an enforcement target at christmas , but may not believe it is at other times of the year . "
a green flag spokesman said : " most drivers do behave responsibly and make other transport arrangements if they know they are going to drink , but there is still the hardcore who think they can take the risks that ultimately could end theirs or someone else 's life . "

one in three said they had driven after drinking two units of alcohol , and 10 % had driven after drinking three .
one in 10 motorists admitted to drink-driving once a month or more often .
the survey , by road safety charity brake for green flag motoring assistance , comes as the christmas anti-drink drive campaign begins .
this year , the government is re-running a tv advert used earlier this year , showing a young female cyclist being involved in a crash with a drink-driver .
in the brake survey , a quarter admitted to drink-driving even when they knew the alcohol was affecting their driving .
and 28 % said that they had risked driving first thing in the morning after drinking a lot of alcohol the night before .
alcohol content standard -lrb- 175ml -rrb- glass of wine - 2 units large -lrb- 250ml -rrb- glass of wine - 3 units pint of standard lager - 2.3 units pint of premium lager - 2.8 units pint of strong cider - 4.7 units the survey also showed that motorists had a poor grasp of alcohol units and the law .
the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood , but this can not easily be translated into alcohol units as it can be affected by build , sex , whether food has been eaten , and a host of other factors .
half of those questioned mistakenly thought that two 25 ml shots of vodka were more alcoholic than a pint of 5.8 % -strength lager .
the real answer is that the lager is about three units , while the vodka is about two units .
just over half wrongly thought it would take two or more units to affect their driving , while 8 % reckoned it would take four or more units .
the real answer is that any amount of alcohol affects driving ability , and there is no safe limit .
' lethal ignorance ' many thought there was a relatively small chance of being caught drinking and driving .
brake 's chief executive mary williams said : " the war against drink-drivers has not been won .
the findings highlight a lethal ignorance of drink-drive law and the effects of drink driving , and widespread levels of drink-driving .
" drivers should never drink and drive - not even one . "
understanding units it is no longer accurate to say one glass of wine is 1 unit a large glass could easily be 3.25 units a pint of strong 8 % lager could easily be 4.5 units how many units is your drink ?
drink-drive deaths have fallen dramatically over the last 20 years , but have been edging up recently .
there were an estimated 560 deaths in the uk last year - 6 % more than in 2001 .
road safety minister david jamieson said : " drink-drivers are still killing people .
" if you are going out and enjoying yourself over christmas , do n't turn your night into a nightmare .

one in three said they had driven after drinking two units of alcohol , and 10 % had driven after drinking three .
one in 10 motorists admitted to drink-driving once a month or more often .
the survey , by road safety charity brake for green flag motoring assistance , comes as the christmas anti-drink drive campaign begins .
this year , the government is re-running a tv advert used earlier this year , showing a young female cyclist being involved in a crash with a drink-driver .
in the brake survey , a quarter admitted to drink-driving even when they knew the alcohol was affecting their driving .
and 28 % said that they had risked driving first thing in the morning after drinking a lot of alcohol the night before .
alcohol content standard -lrb- 175ml -rrb- glass of wine - 2 units large -lrb- 250ml -rrb- glass of wine - 3 units pint of standard lager - 2.3 units pint of premium lager - 2.8 units pint of strong cider - 4.7 units the survey also showed that motorists had a poor grasp of alcohol units and the law .
the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood , but this can not easily be translated into alcohol units as it can be affected by build , sex , whether food has been eaten , and a host of other factors .
half of those questioned mistakenly thought that two 25 ml shots of vodka were more alcoholic than a pint of 5.8 % -strength lager .
the real answer is that the lager is about three units , while the vodka is about two units .
just over half wrongly thought it would take two or more units to affect their driving , while 8 % reckoned it would take four or more units .
the real answer is that any amount of alcohol affects driving ability , and there is no safe limit .
' lethal ignorance ' many thought there was a relatively small chance of being caught drinking and driving .
brake 's chief executive mary williams said : " the war against drink-drivers has not been won .
the findings highlight a lethal ignorance of drink-drive law and the effects of drink driving , and widespread levels of drink-driving .
" drivers should never drink and drive - not even one . "
understanding units it is no longer accurate to say one glass of wine is 1 unit a large glass could easily be 3.25 units a pint of strong 8 % lager could easily be 4.5 units how many units is your drink ?
drink-drive deaths have fallen dramatically over the last 20 years , but have been edging up recently .
there were an estimated 560 deaths in the uk last year - 6 % more than in 2001 .
road safety minister david jamieson said : " drink-drivers are still killing people .
" if you are going out and enjoying yourself over christmas , do n't turn your night into a nightmare .
" leave the car at home and , if you ca n't use public transport , designate a non-drinking driver .
remember that you could still be over the limit in the morning after a good night out . "
the aa motoring trust called for similar campaigns all year round .
a spokesman said : " people know that drink-driving is an enforcement target at christmas , but may not believe it is at other times of the year . "
a green flag spokesman said : " most drivers do behave responsibly and make other transport arrangements if they know they are going to drink , but there is still the hardcore who think they can take the risks that ultimately could end theirs or someone else 's life . "

among the qualifiers are no less than four parties that are likely to put up daughters of former presidents as their presidential candidates .
three daughters of founding father sukarno are standing , as is the daughter of president suharto , who ousted him in 1965 .
the election is the first direct presidential vote in indonesian history .
incumbent president megawati sukarnoputri , a daughter of sukarno , will be running against two of her sisters , sukmawati and rachmawati .
there is some disillusionment with megawati 's reforms they are expected to be joined in the race by the millionaire daughter of disgraced president suharto , siti hardyanto rukmana .
suharto was forced out of office five years ago in part because of public anger over his perceived nepotism .
most of these presidential offspring are hoping to cash in on a growing public nostalgia for the certainties of the past .

" call an ambulance for the wrong reason and someone could die " is the message which will be seen on 15,000 posters throughout northern england from monday .
eight services - west yorkshire , south yorkshire , lincolnshire , cumbria , north east , greater manchester , lancashire and tees , east and north yorkshire -lrb- tenyas -rrb- - are backing the campaign .
it has been launched to coincide with the run-up to christmas - the busiest time of year for ambulance crews .
lives at risk every year , up to a quarter of all 999 calls do not require an emergency response , said tim lynch , director of patient services at tenyas .
" we are not talking about hoax calls but people demanding an ambulance for all manner of reasons , including toothache and other minor ailments , " he said .

controllers for the tees , east and north yorkshire service are already dealing with 400 to 600 emergency calls a day and that is expected to rise to 900 a day over the peak festive period , a tenyas spokesman said .
hull-based paramedic ron wilkinson said : " i hope the poster will make people sit up and think about why we have emergency ambulances .

its ethical purchasing index found that in 2002 ethical consumption in the uk was worth £ 19.86bn.
more than half of uk shoppers claim to have deliberately avoided at least one product because of their principles .
ethical banking , energy , and food products are all growth areas , but the total market share of ethical goods and services is still less than 2 % .
local stores the co-op estimates that £ 6.9bn was spent on ethical goods and services , including fairtrade food products , while £ 7.4bn went to ethical financial services .
in addition around £ 5.6bn was spent in line with consumers ' principles through shopping locally , boycotting big brands , recycling and using public transport .
simon williams , director of corporate affairs at the co-operative bank , said : " the full extent of ethical consumerism will always be difficult to gauge , given that it is about the motivation behind a particular purchase as much as the product or service itself .
" for instance , many people shop locally for convenience but for others the overriding consideration is to buy from local stores in order to support their community . "
cosmetics sales the co-operative research found sales of energy efficient household appliances now have a 41 % market share , and 40 % of eggs sold are free range .
william sankey , author of the good shoping guide , said : " it is great that ethical purchases generally are growing .
" the effect of the boycotts - £ 2.6bn - might not seem a great deal at this stage ... but we believe big companies listen to this sort of thing . "
but while 80 % oppose testing cosmetics on animals , sales of cosmetics that comply with the humane cosmetics standard have yet to achieve a 2 % market share .

the chariot was unearthed in an iron age burial site earlier this year by engineers working on the new a1 motorway , but the discovery was only made public last week .
wakefield museums service said the find would be given to them and displayed first in pontefract in 2005 and then in castleford when the centre there opens .
the move is expected to take place in about five years ' time .
it is believed the site at darrington , near pontefract , where the chariot was found was the scene of a large funeral ceremony about 500 bc .
the burial chamber also held the bones of a 40-year-old man and the remains of 250 cattle .
archaeologists said the 2,500-year-old site was important because the chariot appeared to have been placed in the pit intact .

the flotation , which was oversubscribed tenfold , values the airline at 2.3bn australian dollars -lrb- £ 980m ; $ 1.7bn -rrb- .
the airline , founded by richard branson three years ago , has almost one-third of the domestic market in the face of resistance from incumbent qantas .
it hopes to beat off competition from jetstar , qantas 's new budget airline , which launches next may .
after the flotation , and having sold almost half the firm to australian transport company patrick corp , mr branson owns only 25 % of virgin blue .
bits and pieces mr branson reckons that virgin blue will see a 50 % -plus jump in sales this year .
he plans to replicate the idea in new zealand , another relatively uncompetitive market , with the launch of pacific blue in the new year .
mr branson used the flotation publicity campaign to trumpet a few other pieces of news from the sprawling virgin group .
he said that california governor arnold schwarzenegger may use tax breaks to persuade him to locate his planned us budget airline in los angeles .
virgin plans to set up an as-yet-unnamed carrier in the us in the middle of next year , and is currently looking for a base and partners .
he also said that his uk-based virgin mobile business could be the next piece of the branson empire to float , possibly only after buying out its partner , german t-mobile .

sex discrimination legislation , a national minimum wage , and more flexible working hours are all helping women catch up in the salary stakes .
but women in part-time work have not made up any ground on the opposite sex , while the best paid professions remain dominated by males .
the biggest divergence in wages is in the financial industry .
managerial differences according to the incomes data services poll , men earned an average 18 % more than women this year , 1 % less than in 2002 .
the 1 % change is double the average annual rate of change over the past 20 years .
men , however , are more likely to work longer hours and put in overtime .
when these extras are included , the difference between earnings rises to 25 % , with men bringing home an average £ 525 a week and women £ 396 .
within the 257 full-time occupations examined in the survey , men earned more than women in 236 .
the biggest gaps were in managerial positions , where salary structures tended to be less transparent , according to ids .

more than two-fifths of the female workforce is employed on a part-time basis .
better earners women also tend to dominate areas such as retail assistants , cleaners and " caring " roles , the survey said .
it is in low-paying jobs , such as retail cashiers , where women tend to be better earners than men .
nearly two-thirds of all public sector employees are women .
according to ids , " because one-in-ten women are either teachers or nurses compared to one-in-thirty men , substantial pay increases for these jobs would close the gender pay gap provided all other things were equal " .
