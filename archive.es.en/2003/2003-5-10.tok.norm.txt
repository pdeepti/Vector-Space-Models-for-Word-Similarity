the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .
" namely a french-german-belgian-luxembourg initiative that is seen as being against the u.s. and against nato . "

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .

" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2003 german socialists lose leader in fight over orientation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabi zimmer says she 's had enough of the party 's internal politics .
a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .
" namely a french-german-belgian-luxembourg initiative that is seen as being against the u.s. and against nato . "

the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?
at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .

the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .

even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .

unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .

from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .
" namely a french-german-belgian-luxembourg initiative that is seen as being against the u.s. and against nato . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.05.2003 german socialists lose leader in fight over orientation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabi zimmer says she 's had enough of the party 's internal politics .
a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .
" namely a french-german-belgian-luxembourg initiative that is seen as being against the u.s. and against nato . "

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .

a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .
the internal strife threatens to send the party into the political wilderness . the head of the left-wing party of democratic socialism gabi zimmer , announced on wednesday she would step down as soon as the pds , the successor to communist east germany 's ruling sed party , could hold a special meeting to find a new leader .
zimmer , 48 , fell victim to a bitter internal power struggle between traditionalists and reformers that is threatening to tear the party apart . zimmer , who has held the top job since october 2000 , said internal party developments had brought her to the decision .
she added she hoped her resignation would bring about a " new start " in both the positions and personnel of the pds , which has been struggling to define a role for itself on the german political landscape and has been hemorrhaging voters in the last several elections . " the pds has simply failed to come up with a political platform that is interesting to the german voters , " gero neugebauer , political scientist at berlin 's free university told dw-world , " and now gabi zimmer has found she can no longer fulfill her duties as head of the party . " two entrenched factions that failure is in part due to the development of two rival camps in the party , which are reflected in the party 's executive committee and have lead to the party 's near paralyzation since last fall . one group , the so-called reformers , wants to orient the party toward " realpolitik " and work within the parliamentary system to be actively involved in the development of policy .
the other faction , made up largely of traditional stalinists and left-wing social democratic apostates from western germany , see the pds future as one of an uncompromising protest party espousing far-left positions that often have little chance of being turned into political reality . while zimmer got backing from the traditionalists as recently as one year ago when she fought off a challenge to her leadership , her one-time allies have since turned against her .
the last straw for zimmer was a strategy paper she presented at the end of april which was to serve as a basis for a counterproposal to chancellor gerhard schröder 's controversial economic and social reform plans .
members of the traditionalist wing of the party executive quashed zimmer 's draft plan . " she was pulverized by people in the executive committee , " said neugebauer .
" resignation was the only thing she could do . " return of the old guard ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the question confronting the party is who will lead it next , and a debate has broken out over whether to bring back an old familiar figure or present a younger , fresher face .
zimmer 's predecessor as pds chief , lothar bisky , said he would be willing to return to the ring if needed .
even gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- , probably the country 's best known pds member and former economics senator in berlin , was mentioned as a possible candidate . but most analysts say that would be a step in the wrong direction .
" it 's about as intelligent as using voodoo to resuscitate a dead body , " said free university 's neugebauer . even pds members are cautioning against returning to the old guard , even though party members like gysi and bisky have name recognition that few other members of the party enjoy . " playing musical chairs with members who have been around for some 13 years is n't going to get us anywhere anymore , " said peter porsch , zimmer 's deputy .
he and other members are advocating putting a new face at the top . who that new face might be will likely be decided at a party meeting this summer .
zimmer has requested that the party meet at the end of july to elect her successor .
but even deciding on the date is falling victim to internal dissent .
zimmer 's opponent on the executive committee and leader of the traditionalists , diether dehm , has called for a ten-week cooling off period before a new head is elected .
if the party goes ahead and meets in july , he and others in his camp have threatened to contest any decision . quo vadis pds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight over the party 's future direction threatens to tear it apart , according to petra pau -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , one of the two pds parliamentarians sitting in the bundestag .
unless the party can convince voters it has its own house in order , she said , it will lose credibility with the voters . looking at recent poll results , that process seems to be already underway . in the 1998 federal elections , the pds got 5.1 percent of the vote and with it , 37 members sitting in parliament .
but in the last federal election in 2002 , that percentage dropped to 4 percent which robbed the pds of its official party status and left just two lonely pds parliamentarians relegated to the back of the chamber .
the party 's flagging fortunes are little better on the local level .
from 22 percent a year and a half ago , only 9 percent of berliners marked pds on their ballots in the last election . after the recent election debacles , many analysts said the pds was condemned to becoming a regional party of the east . there 's no question that that is going to be the fate of the pds over the next ten year , " neugebauer told dw-world .
" the question is whether it can eventually agree on a platform that speaks to voters across germany .
the outlook is n't very good . " in fact , in surveys over the past year , the pds has consistently polled under four percent and there is nothing to indicate that the number of germans willing to vote for the pds will climb anytime soon . some have suggested that the pds might be able to draw voters from the left side of the ruling social democrats and the greens , many of whom are feeling disillusioned with schröder 's reform plans that they claim will dismantle germany 's welfare state . " the pds could possibly siphon off some protest votes , " neugebauer said .
" but that will only a temporary solution .
it 's nothing that will save the party in the long run . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of germany ’ s leftist party ?
at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .

the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations . iraq may not officially have figured on the agenda at the so-called weimar triangle summit in the southwestern polish city of wroclaw on friday , but the leaders of germany , france and poland could not sidestep the issue that has once again strained ties between their countries in recent days .
in an obvious attempt to put aside deep divisions over iraq , chancellor schröder of germany , french president chirac and polish president kwasniewski pledged not to let their differences get in the way of european expansion .
warsaw ’ s determination to play a key role in keeping the peace in postwar iraq has drawn the scorn of berlin and paris at what they see as poland 's upstart ambitions .
washington has offered poland leadership of a 7,000-strong multinational force to secure peace in the northern military zone in iraq as a reward for its strong backing of the u.s. military campaign .
schröder plays down german criticism towards poland this week poland angered berlin when its defense minister told a u.s. newspaper that he intended to ask denmark and germany to contribute to warsaw ’ s division and help with military logistics of the planned operation .
it is widely believed that the polish army alone does not have the necessary experience for heading such an operation .
germany ’ s defense minister peter struck frostily rejected the polish proposal , saying germany had no intention of sending soldiers to iraq without a clear united nations mandate along with backing from the german parliament .
german newspaper editorials also mocked poland ’ s offer to deploy 1,500 troops and lead a force in northern iraq , with one calling warsaw america 's " trojan donkey " and another describing the poles as " insolent . "
but in wroclaw on friday , chancellor schröder attemted to tone down germany 's strong rhetoric in recent days towards the polish proposal .
he said the polish offer had been " communicated unfortunately , " but added that a u.n. security council resolution could open the way for germany to play a role .
" we will do what we can to rebuild iraq , as long as it is under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder told a joint news conference .
chirac strikes conciliatory note poland ’ s refusal to toe germany and france ’ s anti-war line in the months leading up to the u.s.-led war in iraq and its eventual military support for the american campaign in the form of a small troop contingent has led to sharp tensions with its western partners .
in february , french president jacques chirac admonished eu candidate countries , in particular poland , for supporting president bush and publishing an open declaration of their backing instead of keeping their mouths shut .
he warned the candidate countries their pro-u.s. stance could harm their eu accession prospects .
the trenchant french position incensed warsaw , which is still believed to be smarting from the bruising insult .
it is reported that a walkabout for the three leaders on the streets of wroclaw on friday has been cancelled after french fears that president jacques chirac might be jeered by local people .
for his part , chirac struck a conciliatory note but still urged closer dialog among future eu partners .
" when you are building a family , before taking an external position , you need a minimum of consultation - and at least to tell the other family members , " chirac told reporters .
he said france was prepared to discuss how to rebuild iraq .
" our goal is economic reconstruction and restoration of full sovereignty . "
poland defends its iraq moves but despite the obvious tensions over iraq that are expected to overshadow the summit - set up in 1991 originally to help anchor newly-democratic poland in western europe - the poles have struck a conciliatory tone and are casting it in a favorable light .
at the summit , kwasniewski defended poland 's bid to play a role in postwar iraq .
he insisted that that it was possible to be both a reliable eu ally and a backer of washington .
however , kwasniewski made it clear that the french and german leaders could not point fingers at poland ’ s iraq policy .
" if it -lrb- discussions -rrb- go in the other direction then i have my own arguments as to who is doing the dividing , " he said .
" namely a french-german-belgian-luxembourg initiative that is seen as being against the u.s. and against nato . "

a survey by the counter-spam firm brightmail detected more than four million pieces of junk mail on just this day sent to uk internet users .
the volume of unsolicited mail has shot up in the last year , making up nearly half of all net traffic , according to some estimates .
an insight into the staggering scale of the spam problem was provided by microsoft , which said this week that it now blocks 2.4 billion junk messages to its msn and hotmail subscribers every day .
' astonishing ' figure brightmail monitored mails sent for a week in march over the uk net provider , bt openworld .
it found that nearly 11 million out of 25 million messages were scanned were spam - a weekly average of 41 % .
a large chunk of the junk mail , more than four million , was sent on the thursday .
" the problem with spam is well documented , but to get close to the 50 % mark is astonishing and that figure can only increase , " said duncan ingram , managing director at bt openworld .
the deluge of spam is prompting online services like bt openworld to take action to stem the flow of unwanted offers for miracle cures , get-rich-quick schemes and adult products .
the company offers an e-mail protection service free to most of its subscribers .
legal steps in the us , internet giants aol , yahoo and microsoft have all been touting their anti-spam features .
aol recently said it blocked about two billion junk messages in a single day , while last week microsoft revealed its anti-spam measures now net about 2.4 billion spam e-mails sent to its hotmail and msn customers .
some firms are taking to the courts to stop the spammers .
earlier this week , us net provider earthlink won $ 16.4m -lrb- £ 10.3m -rrb- damages and a permanent injunction against someone who sent 850 million unsolicited e-mails via its service .
law suits brought by microsoft and aol against suspected spammers are still making their way through the courts .
