in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .
" it 's incomprehensible that you can be prosecuted for possessing over two grams in bavaria while you can easily get away with 30 grams in schleswig-holstein . "
according to ströbele , the health risks of cannabis are often grossly exaggerated .
after all , he said , " cannabis has never killed anyone .

in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .
" it 's incomprehensible that you can be prosecuted for possessing over two grams in bavaria while you can easily get away with 30 grams in schleswig-holstein . "
according to ströbele , the health risks of cannabis are often grossly exaggerated .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .

in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .
" it 's incomprehensible that you can be prosecuted for possessing over two grams in bavaria while you can easily get away with 30 grams in schleswig-holstein . "
according to ströbele , the health risks of cannabis are often grossly exaggerated .
after all , he said , " cannabis has never killed anyone .

in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .
" it 's incomprehensible that you can be prosecuted for possessing over two grams in bavaria while you can easily get away with 30 grams in schleswig-holstein . "
according to ströbele , the health risks of cannabis are often grossly exaggerated .
after all , he said , " cannabis has never killed anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2003 debate on stem cell research enters new phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research could hold the answers to curing certain diseases in a controversial vote , the european parliament has voted in favor of granting eu money for the use of stem cell research .
the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- feedback do you think government should allow stem cells to be harvested from aborted embryos , or should there be strict limits placed on where such cells can come from ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2003 debate on stem cell research enters new phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research could hold the answers to curing certain diseases in a controversial vote , the european parliament has voted in favor of granting eu money for the use of stem cell research .
the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- feedback do you think government should allow stem cells to be harvested from aborted embryos , or should there be strict limits placed on where such cells can come from ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- feedback do you think government should allow stem cells to be harvested from aborted embryos , or should there be strict limits placed on where such cells can come from ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2003 debate on stem cell research enters new phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research could hold the answers to curing certain diseases in a controversial vote , the european parliament has voted in favor of granting eu money for the use of stem cell research .
the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .

in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .
" it 's incomprehensible that you can be prosecuted for possessing over two grams in bavaria while you can easily get away with 30 grams in schleswig-holstein . "
according to ströbele , the health risks of cannabis are often grossly exaggerated .
after all , he said , " cannabis has never killed anyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2003 debate on stem cell research enters new phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research could hold the answers to curing certain diseases in a controversial vote , the european parliament has voted in favor of granting eu money for the use of stem cell research .
the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview on german television , he argued that " criminal law is ridiculous in this respect - so much damage can be done by putting young people behind bars because of one gram of cannabis . "
the famously controversial politician announced the greens are set to launch an initiative aimed at bringing differing state legislation into line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2003 debate on stem cell research enters new phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research could hold the answers to curing certain diseases in a controversial vote , the european parliament has voted in favor of granting eu money for the use of stem cell research .
the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .
as it stands , legislation dictates that only stem cells obtained prior to january 2002 can be used for research . germany 's laws are much stricter than those in many other european states .
while in britain it is legal to conduct research for certain purposes on a human embryo up to the 14th day after fertilization , germany currently offers the same protection to an embryo created in a petri dish as it does to those inside the womb . germany 's justice minister , brigitte zypries , caused a stir last month when she said embryonic stem cell research opens up valuable opportunities for scientists .
she suggested that lawmakers ask themselves whether germany 's current regulations are too strict .
but even if the ruling is passed at the end of next month , and there is more money at germany 's disposal , it is likely to take some time before the current law is changed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hints at loosening of stem cell law germany could be facing a fundamental change in its bioethics policies , as justice minister brigitte zypries speaks out in favor of loosening the rules on embryonic research . -lrb- october 30 , 2003 -rrb- feedback do you think government should allow stem cells to be harvested from aborted embryos , or should there be strict limits placed on where such cells can come from ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the ballot could clear the way for the artificial fertilization of embryos for research . the european parliament narrowly voted on wednesday to fund research using stem cells taken from embryos , rejecting proposals from the eu commission , which favors tougher guidelines .
now the issue will go to the european council of ministers for the final word at the end of the month . the 298 - 241 vote in parliament recommends releasing eu funds for experimenting on cells from human embryos no more than 14 days old or those left over from fertility treatments . the result was disappointing to the european commission and the parliament 's legal committee , both of whom are opposed to using money from the eu 's coffers for stem cell research .
the commission argues that any decisions should be based on its suggestion to only allow research on stem cells imported prior to june 27 , 2002 .
a cut-off date is designed to allow the use of existing stem cells but prevent the production of new ones . unlike most of the cells in the body , which can only make copies of themselves , stem cells can develop into many different types of cells .
that capability makes them a potential source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
many see stem cell research as opening up new possibilities in the fight against diseases like parkinson 's or alzheimer 's . the fact that stem cells can be harvested from aborted embryos , embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization or cloned embryos has led to opposition by the catholic church , which equates destroying embryos with murder .
countries that are predominately catholic or have large catholic populations , such as italy , austria , portugal , spain , ireland and germany , are uncomfortable with stem cell research . full speed ahead for the industry committee the eu parliament 's industry committee has voted with an overwhelming majority to overturn the june 2002 cut-off date in a move which would facilitate the destruction of embryos for research purposes . the committee wants to secure the right to use eu money to conduct research on embryonic stem cells from both spontaneous abortions or those carried out for medical reasons .
but in a bid to prevent donors from engineering abortions for financial gain , they stress that doctors would receive no money , non-cash benefits or other payments .
they add that generally speaking , research would be conducted on adult stem cells , which could be extracted from the spinal cord . protecting embryos current law in germany is already tighter than the commission 's suggestions .

" a dictionary of bristle " is an idea spawned from the satirical website , that be bristle .
the site features a guide - partly created from user contributions - which explains the meaning of local slang phrases such as " babber " and " rit " one of the book 's authors , harry stoke , told the bbc that he hoped the book would help reignite interest in the accent .
he said : " bristol is a city which is built on history , and its language plays a large part in that .
" but like all regional dialects , bristolian is in danger of dying out .
local pride " the aim of the dictionary is to collate words and phrases in common usage in and around bristol in a bid to keep the language alive . "
the book started off as a tongue-in-cheek collection of bristolian words and phrases put together by mr stoke and co-author vinny green , but grew quickly on the web .
popular ' bristolian ' words " babber " - baby " cas n't " - ca n't " gurt " - very " kinave " - can i have " rit " - write " pitcher " - picture " wheres attoo ? " - where is that ?
" once it went public it became a sort of community project and has grown enormously thanks to submissions from bristolians throughout the city , and the world , who are proud of how they sound . "
thousands have contributed to the website behind the project - it has generated more than 1.5m hits since launching last year .
" it 's proved useful for bristolians living abroad whose new found colleagues do n't understand a word they say . "
although many of the words may seem strange , mr stoke says the most bizarre of them all is " gurt " .

ornithologists , conservationists and local councils are meeting to look at the problems caused by the urban gull population explosion .
the birds have adapted well to urban life and have been known to become aggressive during the mating season .
solutions to the problem include employing a hawk in bristol - and an owl in gloucester - to scare the birds away from their nesting places .
5,000 birds a spokeswoman for gloucester city council said : " this is the first conference on urban gulls and the problems they can create living so close to humans .
this is no longer a seaside issue .
" the birds can get very aggressive when they are feeding chicks and quite defensive .
people do get attacked . "
at the moment , around 5,000 live in and around gloucester and it is hoped that painting oil over gulls ' eggs to sterilise them will help reduce their numbers .
it is also thought that cutting rubbish on the streets will help .
shooting is not considered a viable option as the birds tend to occupy sites in urban centres ; and poisoning requires a special licence .

twelve new police community support officers -lrb- pcsos -rrb- will patrol kensington and chelsea from thursday .
london 's pcsos , usually funded by the metropolitan police , have no powers of arrest but can detain suspects .
councillor nicholas paget-brown said by paying for its own officers , the borough was " investing directly in tackling the concerns of residents " .
in january , 15 london boroughs were given police-funded pcsos who were intended to focus on community offences such as graffiti and litter .
but plans by the home secretary to allow householders to band together to buy their own pcsos were criticised by the police federation this month .
pushing back boundaries it said it would cause confusion about who was in charge of policing adding it had yet to be proven that pcsos had any impact on crime levels .
kensington and chelsea 's existing pcsos have reported 106 graffiti scrawls , 195 " suspicious activities " and 138 untaxed cars in earl 's court alone since april .
" pcsos are the extra eyes and ears of the metropolitan police and although they do n't take the place of police officers , they complement both the work of the police and the council 's own community safety efforts , " said mr paget-brown .
" we are proud to be showing the way and working with the police in pushing back the boundaries between the police 's work and our own priorities . "

wwf scotland expressed concern after analysing met office monthly temperature records .
it also called on the scottish executive to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
the group said three months this year had been classed as exceptionally warm , 2 ° c warmer than average .
and six months had been warmer than the same months in 1997 .
that year was identified as the warmest since 1861 in the met office scottish mainland temperature series of records .
climate change is a growing reality , and is the biggest environmental threat facing scotland richard dixon wwf scotland dr richard dixon , head of policy for wwf scotland , said : " the weather is notoriously unpredictable but , despite the cold snap in october , if i were a betting person , i would put money on 2003 turning out to be warmer than 1997 .
" this would make it the warmest year since accurate records began 142 years ago .
" climate change is a growing reality , and is the biggest environmental threat facing scotland . "
wwf scotland is urging the executive to ensure the new european emissions trading scheme is based on the labour party 's commitment to a 20 % cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010 .
this is opposed to the lower 12.5 % cut in all greenhouse gas emissions being lobbied for by some major power companies .
dr dixon added : " with scotland already experiencing climate change , the scottish executive must back the strongest possible action to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions , both through the new emissions trading scheme and in the forthcoming revision of the scottish climate change programme .
" failure to do so will leave scotland helplessly spiralling into climate chaos . "

wwf scotland expressed concern after analysing met office monthly temperature records .

the group said three months this year had been classed as exceptionally warm , 2 ° c warmer than average .

this is opposed to the lower 12.5 % cut in all greenhouse gas emissions being lobbied for by some major power companies .
dr dixon added : " with scotland already experiencing climate change , the scottish executive must back the strongest possible action to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions , both through the new emissions trading scheme and in the forthcoming revision of the scottish climate change programme .

mr schulte-hillen is leaving the media group after clashing with company chief executive gunter thielen .
divisions have emerged over a series of high-stakes , high-profile deals undertaken by the giant media group .
bertelsmann is due to report third-quarter results on thursday .
merger mania bertelsmann , which includes the fifth largest record company in the world , is currently negotiating a 50-50 joint venture with sony , the music industry leader .
the deal was queried by the supervisory board but was driven on by senior management , led by mr thielen .
mr schulte-hillen 's departure now strengthens the position of the chief executive .
but it also makes private splits on the company embarrassingly public .
" there had been different views between the supervisory board chairman and bertelsmann chairman and ceo gunter thielen on the strategic direction of the company , " bertelsmann said in a statement .
one such division emerged over a failed £ 300m -lrb- $ 500m -rrb- bid for time warner 's publishing division earlier this year .

australian veterinary officer dr hugh millar said a " shredded , ham-type material " had been found in a feedlot at portland , victoria .
it was not immediately clear how many of the shipment 's 50,000 sheep had been exposed to the contaminated food .
under australia 's livestock rules , sheep that have been fed animal products are no longer judged fit for human consumption .
police said they had arrested a 40-year-old man in connection with the incident .
animal liberation , a group which believes the conditions animals are shipped in is cruel , had said it added the pig products on tuesday night .
the latest incident follows a recent debacle during which 50,000 sheep were stranded for 11 weeks in the middle east after the country they were bound for , and several other states , refused to receive the animals for health reasons .
the australian government was eventually forced to buy them back and eritrea took them for free , but not before about 3,770 of the 50,000 sheep died .
animal liberation campaigner ralph hahnheuser said the sheep could not be harmed by the additive , but it would stay in their system for 21 days .
" the fact is they no longer meet the requirements of countries in the middle east , " mr hahnheuser said .
the protest is liable to pose a further threat to australia 's live export trade , which earns the country around aus $ 1bn -lrb- us $ 700m -rrb- a year .

at a meeting on wednesday evening , east hampshire district council rejected proposals from mmo2 airwave to erect masts without planning permission .
airwave had claimed that as they have strict deadlines to erect the masts on behalf of the police , they were justified in putting them up first and then applying for planning permission afterwards .
the whole system in hampshire was to be tested early next month but it could now be delayed for over a year .
independent study tetra is hoped to replace existing analogue radio systems by 2005 regulations about mobile phone masts do not apply to the tetra equipment and some experts have raised concerns about the health effects .
tetra masts pulse at 17.6hz , which is very close to the 16hz frequency the government 's independent expert group on mobile phones warns might affect brain activity .
some studies have suggested radio waves around this frequency could cause calcium to leak from the brain , triggering damage to the nervous and immune systems .
around 120 masts will be needed for the system in hampshire , and airwave were aiming to have them all installed by the end of november .
a home office spokesman said they had carried out a comprehensive research programme into the health and safety aspects of airwave , and that there were no discernable health risks associated with tetra masts .

at a meeting on wednesday evening , east hampshire district council rejected proposals from mmo2 airwave to erect masts without planning permission .
airwave had claimed that as they have strict deadlines to erect the masts on behalf of the police , they were justified in putting them up first and then applying for planning permission afterwards .
the whole system in hampshire was to be tested early next month but it could now be delayed for over a year .
independent study tetra is hoped to replace existing analogue radio systems by 2005 regulations about mobile phone masts do not apply to the tetra equipment and some experts have raised concerns about the health effects .
tetra masts pulse at 17.6hz , which is very close to the 16hz frequency the government 's independent expert group on mobile phones warns might affect brain activity .
some studies have suggested radio waves around this frequency could cause calcium to leak from the brain , triggering damage to the nervous and immune systems .
around 120 masts will be needed for the system in hampshire , and airwave were aiming to have them all installed by the end of november .
a home office spokesman said they had carried out a comprehensive research programme into the health and safety aspects of airwave , and that there were no discernable health risks associated with tetra masts .

some of the flightless birds survived unseen for decades , according to a statistical analysis by scientists reported in the journal nature .
the last confirmed sighting of the dodo was in 1662 on mauritius .
by then the species had long been in decline , driven to extinction by humans and the predators they took to the indian ocean island .
all that remains of the dodo now are the odd skeleton and other body parts , such as head and feet , scattered around the world in museums .
fragments of dna have been extracted from the bones , shedding light on its evolution .
extinction threat the dodo -lrb- raphus cucullatus -rrb- , which was bigger than a turkey , weighing in at about 23 kilograms , was uniquely adapted to its island habitat .
raphus cucullatus forest-dwelling and flightless waded in ponds to catch fish killed by sailors for extra food ship animals stole its eggs the dodo was first seen by portuguese sailors about 1507 but numbers were falling sharply by the beginning of the 17th century .
a pair of researchers , from the uk and the us , used the 10 most recent sightings of the bird , from 1662 to 1598 , to calculate when it might have died out .
it was a statistical analysis and it suggested the last dodo died not in 1662 but 28 years later , in 1690 .
it has always been assumed the bird was long gone by 1681 .
' poor estimate ' the mathematical method the team used could shed light on when other extinct animals , like the dinosaurs , met their demise , using dates from the fossil record rather than sightings .
it might even be possible to predict how long existing threatened species , which have been seen only sporadically in recent years , might survive .
" in most cases , the extinction of a species can be inferred from the record of sightings or from collections of individual organisms , " co-authors david roberts of the royal botanic gardens in south east england and andrew solow of the woods hole oceanographic institution , massachusetts , write in the journal nature .
" but when a species becomes increasingly rare before its final extinction , it may continue to exist unseen for many years - so the time of its last sighting may be a poor estimate of the time of extinction . "

by then the species had long been in decline , driven to extinction by humans and the predators they took to the indian ocean island .
all that remains of the dodo now are the odd skeleton and other body parts , such as head and feet , scattered around the world in museums .
fragments of dna have been extracted from the bones , shedding light on its evolution .
extinction threat the dodo -lrb- raphus cucullatus -rrb- , which was bigger than a turkey , weighing in at about 23 kilograms , was uniquely adapted to its island habitat .
raphus cucullatus forest-dwelling and flightless waded in ponds to catch fish killed by sailors for extra food ship animals stole its eggs the dodo was first seen by portuguese sailors about 1507 but numbers were falling sharply by the beginning of the 17th century .
a pair of researchers , from the uk and the us , used the 10 most recent sightings of the bird , from 1662 to 1598 , to calculate when it might have died out .
it was a statistical analysis and it suggested the last dodo died not in 1662 but 28 years later , in 1690 .
it has always been assumed the bird was long gone by 1681 .
' poor estimate ' the mathematical method the team used could shed light on when other extinct animals , like the dinosaurs , met their demise , using dates from the fossil record rather than sightings .
it might even be possible to predict how long existing threatened species , which have been seen only sporadically in recent years , might survive .
" in most cases , the extinction of a species can be inferred from the record of sightings or from collections of individual organisms , " co-authors david roberts of the royal botanic gardens in south east england and andrew solow of the woods hole oceanographic institution , massachusetts , write in the journal nature .
" but when a species becomes increasingly rare before its final extinction , it may continue to exist unseen for many years - so the time of its last sighting may be a poor estimate of the time of extinction . "

sarrosh , 18 , left john kelly girls ' technology college two years ago to start at another sixth form , but soon returned .
she said : " i tried two other places .
the first did n't have a lot of computers .
we shared one between about 10 of us .
" when i went to another place , they only had one computer room for the whole sixth form .
here , you have computers everywhere . "
specialist schools , which can also focus on sports , the arts , science , languages or business , get an extra £ 126 per year per pupil .
the money has enabled the two john kellys to invest heavily in technology .
alecia wants to go on to study languages at a-level this did not happen previously in neasden , a deprived area of the borough of brent .
at the two schools , 40 % of pupils have special needs , and 40 % get free school meals .
some 42 languages are spoken .
" it 's a really difficult area to work , " mrs heaps said .
" what our specialist school is about is not just offering the national curriculum but the national curriculum-plus , giving them more than normal .
" we are entirely non-selective , so everyone gets a chance .
but the children have so many more opportunities than they would in a normal school .
" a few weeks ago , some sixth-formers had a link-up to kenya , where they spoke to a nobel prize-winning scientist , who discussed his work with malaria .
they had just the most fantastic discussion .
" it was spine-tingling .
i would say that 97 % of schools still do n't have that sort of thing going on .
where else would many of the kids here ever experience that ? "
' not elitist ' enthusiasm for continued learning has grown , with 65 % of the boys and 50 % of the girls staying on at sixth-form .
when mr young and mrs heaps started in 1990 , both schools were barely half-full and often the last choice among local parents .
today , they are over-subscribed .
the number of girls getting five gcses / gnvqs at grade a * to c has more than doubled since 1994 .
for boys it has risen by 17 % to 41 % in two years .
both schools are open from 7.30am to 5pm each week day , as a " community facility " .
their buildings , mostly completed in 1958 , are not pretty but some corporate-style rebranding has taken place .
a firm has designed a simple logo with four colours - green , purple , blue and sandy yellow .
these broadly represent the afro-caribbean , indian , asian , middle-eastern and european cultures of the children .
' try our best ' the schools have also created links with 13 other secondaries and 11 primaries , sharing ideas for improvement .
however one feels about specialists , there is a palpable buzz among the pupils and staff at the two john kellys .
they have to re-bid for their status every four years , by proving to the department for education and skills that they have maintained standards .
if not , they lose the extra funding .
" it 's not elitist .
it does not matter who comes here , we will try our best to give them a better education , " mr young said .
" i would recommend to any school that it should become a specialist . "
mrs heaps added : " it made us feel special when we first became a specialist .
for the first time , john kelly had achieved something .
it still makes us feel special now . "
the two john kelly technology colleges have both won national awards from the specialist schools trust for their work helping other schools .

brian greenslade , leader of devon county council , called the government 's latest spending settlements for local authorities a " shabby blow to devon " .
he said most of the 4.2 % rise would be swallowed up by government demands for a big increase in spending on schools .
and he warned there could be another double-figure council tax rise - following the 18 % rise this year .
there is a limit to what people can afford to pay brian greenslade he said : " we are very conscious of the affects of council tax rises on local people , particularly in a county like devon where there are a lot of people on fixed incomes , like pensioners .
" so i think we shall be looking at an increase in council tax and cuts in services , but there is a limit to what people can afford to pay . "
mr greenslade said that if the council tax was kept down to the rate of inflation , the council would have to make £ 22m of cuts to services .
police encouraged he said : " i do n't think the rise will be as big as this year , but we will have to look at the impact on our spending .
" we have a grant increase of £ 15m next year , but the government is telling us that we have to pass on £ 14.2m to our schools .
" we have no objection to the schools getting the extra money , but that leaves just £ 800,000 to cover increased costs in all our other services . "
in torbay there is a provisional government grant increase of 5.9 % , which the council says will lead to a large increase in council tax .
devon and cornwall police authority said it was encouraged with its increase of 3.25 % , although it was still not enough .
in plymouth the provisional increase is 3.7 % .
a statement from the city council said more work needed to be done to determine the effect on services and tax levels .
