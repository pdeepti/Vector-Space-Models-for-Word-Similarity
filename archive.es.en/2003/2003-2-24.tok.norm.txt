u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .

the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .

the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .
the request set off an internal dispute that climaxed when germany , france and belgium filed vetoes against the plan on feb .
10 .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .
the base also played a major role in the persian gulf war .
today , it is the staging area for operation northern watch , the mission of monitoring the northern no-fly zone in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato finds solution to end crisis at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .

" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .

benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .
matthias heyl , however , believes that once young people learn about the history of the " white rose " , they can identify with the members of the group even today .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .
answers like " white rose – jews ? .
to be honest with you , i have no idea about them ... " , were common . topic of resistance not dealt with thoroughly in germany according to one survey , only about every third german in 1991 knew that there were students who had fought nazi germany .
resistance expert wolfgang benz , head of the center for anti-semitic research , says that even today , many german citizens have very vague ideas about resistance against hitler .
" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .
matthias heyl , head of the youth meeting point in the former concentration camp of ravensbrück , says that most of these ignorant attitudes also apply to german youngsters .
" we know from our own experience here , that there are certain schools , in which the topic is dealt with in detail and then there are others , where one has to begin really from scratch .
it -lrb- " white rose " and resistance groups -rrb- is not widespread . "
benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .
matthias heyl , however , believes that once young people learn about the history of the " white rose " , they can identify with the members of the group even today .
" when one looks at the biographies of hans and sophie scholl and the other members of the " white rose " , one realizes that they were completely normal people who used their ordinary opportunities to do something extraordinary , " he says .
indeed one place in germany where students look upon the members of the " white rose " as role models is a high school in the small town of pulheim near cologne , named after the brother and sister duo , hans and sophie scholl .
for the students here the young resistance fighters of the " white rose " stand for values that are valid even today : they ’ re a sign against the war and a symbol of hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.02.2003 fighting the battle of the bulge at a tender age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just baby fat ?
in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .
however she declined to comment on how nestlé , one of the world 's largest producers of chocolate and milk products , viewed the proposed voluntary guidelines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .

but he says citizens have no reason to panic . the german government warned over the weekend that the threat of terror attacks was higher than ever before . in an interview with the newspaper welt am sonntag , interior minister otto schily said that in the case of a war in iraq , it was likely militant groups would try to take advantage of the situation " to whip up further hostilities against western europe . " he said security experts inside and outside germany feared osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization , blamed for the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , had reorganized and was planning new strikes . " it ca n't be predicted what al qaeda 's next targets may be , " schily told public radio .
" the organization plans long term and counts on surprise effect . " although the number of foreign militants dropped by 1,600 to 57,000 in 2002 , schily said these were a potential danger to germany.bin laden 's terror network regards germany as a hostile country , he said .
" in addition , there is alarming information on the security of our troops in afghanistan in the case of a war in iraq , " he said . attacks aimed at ' soft targets ' in germany , schily warned of terror attacks on american , british and jewish institutions .
he said attacks also could be aimed at so-called " soft targets , " which do not have military protection , including office buildings , nightclubs and churches .
because these locations could not be protected day and night , schily said the public needed as much advance warning as possible . a domestic german intelligence service also voiced concern over the weekend about possible terror attacks in case of a war in iraq .
helmut rannacher , who leads the office for the protection of the constitution in baden-württemberg , told the stuttgarter nachrichten that he expected a high level of solidarity among islamic militants in the case of a war .
obviously , some militant branches are just waiting for a u.s.-led attack , rannacher said .
" the hatred of israel and the u.s. is increasing and is turning into a transnational phenomenon , " he said . but in sunday 's interview , schily warned of causing panic .
at vital utilities , the government has reinforced security measures , including water works , energy plants and communication centers , he said .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .

the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .
the request set off an internal dispute that climaxed when germany , france and belgium filed vetoes against the plan on feb .
10 .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .

on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .

" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .

they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .

a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .
answers like " white rose – jews ? .
to be honest with you , i have no idea about them ... " , were common . topic of resistance not dealt with thoroughly in germany according to one survey , only about every third german in 1991 knew that there were students who had fought nazi germany .
resistance expert wolfgang benz , head of the center for anti-semitic research , says that even today , many german citizens have very vague ideas about resistance against hitler .
" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .
matthias heyl , head of the youth meeting point in the former concentration camp of ravensbrück , says that most of these ignorant attitudes also apply to german youngsters .
" we know from our own experience here , that there are certain schools , in which the topic is dealt with in detail and then there are others , where one has to begin really from scratch .
it -lrb- " white rose " and resistance groups -rrb- is not widespread . "
benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .
matthias heyl , however , believes that once young people learn about the history of the " white rose " , they can identify with the members of the group even today .
" when one looks at the biographies of hans and sophie scholl and the other members of the " white rose " , one realizes that they were completely normal people who used their ordinary opportunities to do something extraordinary , " he says .
indeed one place in germany where students look upon the members of the " white rose " as role models is a high school in the small town of pulheim near cologne , named after the brother and sister duo , hans and sophie scholl .
for the students here the young resistance fighters of the " white rose " stand for values that are valid even today : they ’ re a sign against the war and a symbol of hope .
" they stood up for justice and were caught and killed in the end , " says one student . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live projekt zukunft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "

the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .
daschner made his decision as police tried to solve a case that shook the capital of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich and sylvia von metzler mourn the loss of their son .
german banking community , frankfurt .
eleven-year-old jakob von metzler did not return home from school on sept .
27 .
on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch the police vice president also has gained the support from the premier of the state of hesse , where frankfurt is located .
" personally , i think that in human terms daschner 's actions in this difficult dilemma are completely understandable , " roland koch said in a weekend newspaper interview .
group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .
but the vice president said he had no regrets about his actions .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .

the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .

they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .

" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .
daschner made his decision as police tried to solve a case that shook the capital of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich and sylvia von metzler mourn the loss of their son .
german banking community , frankfurt .
eleven-year-old jakob von metzler did not return home from school on sept .
27 .
on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch the police vice president also has gained the support from the premier of the state of hesse , where frankfurt is located .
" personally , i think that in human terms daschner 's actions in this difficult dilemma are completely understandable , " roland koch said in a weekend newspaper interview .
group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .
but the vice president said he had no regrets about his actions .
" i would do the same thing today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.02.2003 turkey could offer valuable launching pad for u.s. forces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing for war : turkish soldiers conduct a chemical warfare drill at incirlik air base last month .
u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .
the request set off an internal dispute that climaxed when germany , france and belgium filed vetoes against the plan on feb .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .
the request set off an internal dispute that climaxed when germany , france and belgium filed vetoes against the plan on feb .
10 .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .
the base also played a major role in the persian gulf war .
today , it is the staging area for operation northern watch , the mission of monitoring the northern no-fly zone in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato finds solution to end crisis at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .

" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .

benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .
answers like " white rose – jews ? .
to be honest with you , i have no idea about them ... " , were common . topic of resistance not dealt with thoroughly in germany according to one survey , only about every third german in 1991 knew that there were students who had fought nazi germany .
resistance expert wolfgang benz , head of the center for anti-semitic research , says that even today , many german citizens have very vague ideas about resistance against hitler .
" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .
matthias heyl , head of the youth meeting point in the former concentration camp of ravensbrück , says that most of these ignorant attitudes also apply to german youngsters .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .

on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "

group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .

turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .

a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .

29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .
the request set off an internal dispute that climaxed when germany , france and belgium filed vetoes against the plan on feb .

the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .
the base also played a major role in the persian gulf war .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .

as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .
voluntarily lean ?
the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .
" we ’ ve been talking to the industry about if and how it would be possible to produce products for children such as candies and chips with a lowered fat content of 5 to 10 percent , " the consumer protection minister said .
a spokeswoman from nestlé germany in munich confirmed that the company was involved in talks with the ministry at the national as well as european level about possible ways to lower fat content in snacks .
however she declined to comment on how nestlé , one of the world 's largest producers of chocolate and milk products , viewed the proposed voluntary guidelines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .

in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .
low awareness in germany about " white rose " over the years , the " white rose " and their brutal silencing by the gestapo has came to symbolize still relatively unknown german resistance against hitler , both internationally and within germany .
history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .

resistance expert wolfgang benz , head of the center for anti-semitic research , says that even today , many german citizens have very vague ideas about resistance against hitler .
" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .

it -lrb- " white rose " and resistance groups -rrb- is not widespread . "
benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .
matthias heyl , however , believes that once young people learn about the history of the " white rose " , they can identify with the members of the group even today .

history lessons at several schools and universities world-wide that deal with the world war and the holocaust inevitably find mention of the courageous student group that dared to defy hitler ’ s rule .
but despite international recognition of the munich student group and their brave role during nazi germany , few germans between the ages of 15 and 30 today are aware of the group or their significance .
in interviews with dw-radio , some young people on the streets of germany were pretty clueless of what " white rose " meant .
answers like " white rose – jews ? .
to be honest with you , i have no idea about them ... " , were common . topic of resistance not dealt with thoroughly in germany according to one survey , only about every third german in 1991 knew that there were students who had fought nazi germany .
resistance expert wolfgang benz , head of the center for anti-semitic research , says that even today , many german citizens have very vague ideas about resistance against hitler .
" one knows that there was resistance .
for sure , most also know that there wasn ’ t much of it .
and when it comes to the details of how resistance to the regime was actually carried out , that ’ s when the lack of knowledge becomes apparent , " he says .
matthias heyl , head of the youth meeting point in the former concentration camp of ravensbrück , says that most of these ignorant attitudes also apply to german youngsters .
" we know from our own experience here , that there are certain schools , in which the topic is dealt with in detail and then there are others , where one has to begin really from scratch .
it -lrb- " white rose " and resistance groups -rrb- is not widespread . "
benz and heyl explain the lack of knowledge regarding resistance groups by the fact that the nazi era lies too far back in the past – almost 60 years and the fact that the topic is hardly discussed at the moment in german society .
the present generation , according to them , can ’ t imagine the amount of courage one needed back then during the dictatorial regime to raise a voice of dissent against hitler .
matthias heyl , however , believes that once young people learn about the history of the " white rose " , they can identify with the members of the group even today .
" when one looks at the biographies of hans and sophie scholl and the other members of the " white rose " , one realizes that they were completely normal people who used their ordinary opportunities to do something extraordinary , " he says .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of . on a clear february day in 1943 , hans and sophie scholl entered the deserted atrium of the ludwig-maximilian university of munich bearing a suitcase full of leaflets containing a passionate appeal to germans to engage in " passive resistance " against hitler and the third reich .
they worked swiftly , dropping stacks of the explosive leaflets throughout the corridors , just minutes before the atrium would be flooded with students leaving lectures and classes .
before hurrying outside to safety , the brother and sister , on a last-minute urge , decided to get rid of the remaining few documents in the suitcase .
22-year-old biology and philosophy student sophie scholl hurriedly climbed the grand marble staircase to the upper level of the hall and in a rush of emotion , flung the last remaining leaflets high in the air .
the dozens of pamphlets glided down to the feet of scores of stunned students exiting lecture halls , among them university janitor and nazi party member , jakob schmidt .
schmidt spotted sophie and hans with the leaflets - within minutes the doors were locked , the police called and hans and sophie were hustled into gestapo custody .
four days later they went on trial for treason along with another accomplice , 24-year-old christoph probst , and were executed by the gestapo within hours on the same day .
inciting resistance through bold actions today , memories of the " white rose " student group live on through numerous memorials , films and books on the story of the courageous members who courted certain death as they worked night and day , cranking a hand-operated duplicating machine to create laboriously-penned leaflets urging ordinary germans to resist hitler and his anti-semitic policies .
the leaflets were stuffed into envelopes , stamped and mailed from various major cities in southern germany to students , academics , scholars and café owners , their addresses randomly chosen from telephone books .
some of them were even anonymously distributed in the streets of munich and at house doors .
" hitler can not win the war , he can only prolong it .
the guilt of his helpers has forever crossed every possible boundary .
that ’ s why you should separate yourself from the nazis !
show through your actions that you think otherwise ! , " one of the pamphlets said .
in an even bolder move , three members of the " white rose " also painted slogans on the sides of houses in ludwigstrasse , one of munich ’ s main thoroughfares .
they wrote , " down with hitler " , " hitler mass murderer " , " freedom " and drew crossed-out swastikas .
two months after the execution of sophie and hans scholl and christoph probst , three further members of the " white rose " , among them 49-year-old philosophy professor , kurt huber , the editorial brain behind the leaflets , were also sentenced to death and summarily executed .

but he says citizens have no reason to panic . the german government warned over the weekend that the threat of terror attacks was higher than ever before . in an interview with the newspaper welt am sonntag , interior minister otto schily said that in the case of a war in iraq , it was likely militant groups would try to take advantage of the situation " to whip up further hostilities against western europe . " he said security experts inside and outside germany feared osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization , blamed for the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , had reorganized and was planning new strikes . " it ca n't be predicted what al qaeda 's next targets may be , " schily told public radio .
" the organization plans long term and counts on surprise effect . " although the number of foreign militants dropped by 1,600 to 57,000 in 2002 , schily said these were a potential danger to germany.bin laden 's terror network regards germany as a hostile country , he said .
" in addition , there is alarming information on the security of our troops in afghanistan in the case of a war in iraq , " he said . attacks aimed at ' soft targets ' in germany , schily warned of terror attacks on american , british and jewish institutions .
he said attacks also could be aimed at so-called " soft targets , " which do not have military protection , including office buildings , nightclubs and churches .
because these locations could not be protected day and night , schily said the public needed as much advance warning as possible . a domestic german intelligence service also voiced concern over the weekend about possible terror attacks in case of a war in iraq .
helmut rannacher , who leads the office for the protection of the constitution in baden-württemberg , told the stuttgarter nachrichten that he expected a high level of solidarity among islamic militants in the case of a war .
obviously , some militant branches are just waiting for a u.s.-led attack , rannacher said .
" the hatred of israel and the u.s. is increasing and is turning into a transnational phenomenon , " he said . but in sunday 's interview , schily warned of causing panic .
at vital utilities , the government has reinforced security measures , including water works , energy plants and communication centers , he said .
and as to " soft targets , " he said " it would be wrong to panic .
that way , the terrorists would have won already .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.02.2003 police threat fuels debate on torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police threatened to torture jakob von metzler 's kidnapper in order to find out the missing boy 's whereabouts .
authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .
daschner made his decision as police tried to solve a case that shook the capital of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich and sylvia von metzler mourn the loss of their son .
german banking community , frankfurt .
eleven-year-old jakob von metzler did not return home from school on sept .
27 .
on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch the police vice president also has gained the support from the premier of the state of hesse , where frankfurt is located .
" personally , i think that in human terms daschner 's actions in this difficult dilemma are completely understandable , " roland koch said in a weekend newspaper interview .
group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .
but the vice president said he had no regrets about his actions .

authorities in frankfurt , germany , were ready to resort to violence in an attempt to solve a kidnapping case .
and some groups are upset that the ban on torture should ever be called into question . the pressure created by the kidnapping case was becoming unbearable for the vice president of the frankfurt police force .
the 11-year-old son of a prominent banking family had been missing for more than three days , and the law student arrested in the case was refusing to talk .
at that point on oct .
1 , wolfgang daschner had one troubling question weighing on his mind : " how much more time do we have to save the child 's life ? "
that question led to another question : what would make the suspect talk ?
daschner soon reached his conclusion .
" my mission , " he said in a recent newspaper interview , " was to let the suspect know one thing : if you do n't tell us where the child is , we will begin hurting you . "
comment fuels torture debate the statement , made this month as prosecutors put the finishing touches on their case against the 27-year-old law student , has triggered a debate over an issue that seemed to have been decided long ago in germany : should police be allowed to torture suspects ?
according to the german constitution , the answer is no .
" suspects being held in police detention may not be emotionally or physically abused , " it says .
internationally , the united nations has its own committee against torture aimed at stamping out the practice .
and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .

the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "

group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .

and german politicians regularly raise this issue in discussions concerning the possible admission of turkey to the european union .
" turkey still practices torture , " angela merkel , the head of germany 's biggest opposition party , the christian democratic union , said in december .
daschner made his decision as police tried to solve a case that shook the capital of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich and sylvia von metzler mourn the loss of their son .
german banking community , frankfurt .
eleven-year-old jakob von metzler did not return home from school on sept .
27 .
on the very same day , a ransom note demanding € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.07 million -rrb- was placed on the entrance gate of the metzler family 's villa .
the family agreed to pay , and the money was dropped at a frankfurt streetcar stop on sunday night .
at that point , the case took a positive turn for police .
police officers watching over the streetcar stop soon had a suspect , identified only as magnus g. they say he picked up the money in his own car and later went on a shopping spree , ordering a mercedes at a car dealer and booking a flight to fuerteventura , one of the canary islands .
on monday , police decided to make an arrest after they noticed the suspect had made no effort to free the boy .
police make torture threat daschner , knowing the boy had been missing since friday , then made his threat and let the suspect know just what he had in mind .
" every martial arts specialist knows there are places on your ear that will hurt , hurt a lot , without causing any injuries when you press them , " daschner told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
daschner did not have to carry out his threat .
ten minutes later , the suspect decided to talk .
and the message he had confirmed authorities worst fears .
the boy was dead .
he was killed shortly after the kidnapping , and his body was dumped in a lake north of frankfurt .
in justifying his decision , daschner said last week : " not one single person has been able to tell me what i should have done . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch the police vice president also has gained the support from the premier of the state of hesse , where frankfurt is located .
" personally , i think that in human terms daschner 's actions in this difficult dilemma are completely understandable , " roland koch said in a weekend newspaper interview .
group demands respect for ban but not everyone agrees with daschner 's comments .
they have produced an outcry from one human-rights organization and set off an argument within germany 's national coalition government of social democrats and greens .
the head of amnesty international germany demanded an investigation be launched into the case .
" we call on the hesse state government to examine the case and determine whether legal penalities should be applied , " said barbara lochbihler .
" the ban on torture must apply in germany as it should around the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries the argument between the country 's coalition members began last week after justice minister brigitte zypries suggested that daschner had acted properly .
in a radio interview , the social democrat acknowledged that torture was illegal .
but she also suggested that the german criminal code allowed police to take extraordinary meaures when they face what the law calls " justified emergency situations . "
a police officer charged as a result of such action would be acquitted , zypries said .
in response , a member of the greens criticized zypries .
" the minister would have been better off not saying anything , " said christa nickels , a legal expert for the party .
" i regret her comments . "
the criticism prompted a ministry spokeswoman to clarify zypries ' views , saying that officials were not thinking about altering the ban on torture .
for daschner , the case is far from over .
proseuctors are considering whether to charge him and police officials with attempting to violently extract information from the suspect .
but the vice president said he had no regrets about his actions .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .

the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .
u.s. backing of turkey in the give and take of international politics , the united states has stood by turkey in another international arena , the north atlantic treaty organization .
the united states asked nato last month to begin military planning to support the member turkey in case of war .

the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was finally settled late sunday after a 13-hour session .
turkey and the united states have long military ties .
a key focus of u.s. military operations is incirlik air base in south-central turkey .
in 1960 , francis gary powers took off from the base in a u-2 spy plane before he was shot over the soviet union in an incident that triggered a cold war crisis .

u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say . u.s. secretary of state colin powell headed off to asia on friday with difficult issues involving japan , china and south korea on his agenda .
but the retired u.s. army general also was likely to be mulling over a pressing problem created by a key ally that lies at the crossroads between europe and the middle east .
that ally is turkey and the issue is the potential turkish endorsement of a plan that would allow washington to deploy tens of thousands of troops in the nato country for a possible invasion of iraq . turkey has been wary of complete support for a us-led invasion and on friday said their decision on allowing american troops to use turkey as a springboard was still a few days off .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul " they understand our worries , we understand theirs .
a result will be reached in the coming days , " turkish prime minister abdullah gul told an istanbul meeting .
the reason to use turkey for the united states , turkey would provide a key launching pad if the bush administration decided to invade iraq .
knowing the country 's value , the u.s. government is willing to pay a major price , up to $ 26 billion in grants and loan guarantees to compensate turkey for war-related economic damage .
turkey has asked for $ 30 billion .
the point of the u.s. assistance is to win valuable maneuver room for the commander of u.s. forces , army general tommy franks .
with turkish permission , franks could open what one analyst called a " two-pronged " war against the forces of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in this scenario , u.s. troops would swarm across the 218-mile border that turkey shares with iraq and pour in from the south in kuwait .
" that would split saddam 's forces , " said phillip mitchell of the international institute for strategic studies in london .
" saddam would not know from one day to another where the pressure would come from . "
oil fields would be a key goal as part of this two-front assault , the forces invading from the north would have their eye fixed on the iraqi oil fields stretching across this region , said jeremy binnie , middle east editor for jane 's sentinel security assessment in london .
the short-term goal of this mission would be clear , binnie said : to prevent iraqi forces from destroying the oil fields in the same way they did in kuwait in 1991 .
by preventing a repeat of this pollution and cleanup nightmare , u.s. forces could also help a postwar government , he said .
" they need as much oil flowing as possible to fund the reconstruction of iraq , " binnie said .
even if they accomplish the task of protecting the fields , a successor government in iraq would be unable to count on major revenue for years to come , according to a study by rice university 's baker institute and the council on foreign relations .
the report concludes that it will take 18 months to three years and $ 5 billion to bring the iraqi oil industry back to pre-1990s production levels of 3.5 million barrels per day .
currently , the country 's oil production capacity in iraq is around 100,000 barrels per day , the study said .
u.s. troops seen as security force as an offshoot of the operation , u.s. forces could help secure a region that is a potential source of trouble for turkish leaders .
northern iraq is the home of the kurds , and the turkish leaders worry that if the kurds formed an independent state in the north of iraq , kurdish guerrillas in southeastern turkey could resume their rebellion .
in anticipation of turkish approval , four u.s. ships carrying tanks and other heavy equipment for the army 's 4th infantry division are waiting off the turkish coast , according to the washington post and other news reports .
a pentagon spokesman would not confirm these figures in an interview with dw-world on friday .
a turkish refusal would force franks to make other plans .
the general acknowledged this much in a television interview with the fox news channel this week .
' ' in every case with a good war plan , there are many ways to accomplish the mission that we may be given , " franks said .
life-saving operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marines of the 15th marine expeditionary unit disembark from ch-46e sea knight helicopters aboard the uss peleliu somewhere in the arabian sea , monday oct .
29 , 2001 .
the uss peleliu is an amphibious assault ship based in san diego .
the marines are part of the 15th marine expeditionary unit that is supporting operation enduring freedom .
loren thompson , chief executive officer of the lexington institute , a think tank in arlington , va . , said the loss of turkey as an invasion launching pad would have two major disadvantages .
the operation " would take longer and more americans would be likely to die , " thompson told dw-world on friday .
binnie also suggested this change of plan " would make things harder . "
instead of sending troops backed by armor from turkey , franks would likely have to send in airborne units to accomplish the mission , he said .
in an earlier interview with the boston globe , thompson said he envisioned a similar solution .
but thompson said an assault using c-17 transport planes to airlift forces into northern iraq would be difficult .
that deployment ' ' would require a lot of sorties , and we do n't have a lot of those aircraft , " he told the globe .
such airlifts would raise another logistical problem as well , thompson told dw-world .
" you have to get the forces to a secure location where they could board the planes , " he said .
focus on the political issue for now , though , washington officials ' priority is the political decision to be made by the turkish government .
the united states already has won one round of support from the turks as part of the military buildup against iraq .
earlier this month , the country 's parliament took a first step in supporting the united states by allowing the american military to renovate several bases and ports for use in case a war starts .
but the issue of allowing thousands of more u.s. troops into the country for an invasion of iraq remains a problem .
binnie suggested that the turkish government eventually would go along .
" they can not afford to say no , " he said .
for one thing , such a refusal could dampen u.s. support in other areas , like turkey 's drive to join the european union , he said .
" the united states might not be as supportive as previously , " binnie said .
thompson also said he expected the turkish government to support the united states .
" they do n't want to lose influence over a postwar iraq , " he said .

in the face of an alarming rise of obesity among children in germany , consumer protection minister renate künast has suggested a plan to trim the flab at an early age . like much of the rich industrialized world , germany is watching its children grow increasingly fat .
kids ' tendencies to snack on chocolate bars during school breaks , hang out in fast-food restaurants after school and chomp on chips and candies while watching television or the computer screen has led to a dramatic increase in childhood obesity .
the problem has gained new urgency in light of statistics that show a dramatic jump in the number of overweight children in germany .
according to a new study by the german society for nutrition , every fourth to fifth german child is considered too heavy for his age and size by the time he or she starts school .
when compared to statistics from 25 years ago , the number of " fat " children in the 5-7 age group has more than doubled .
among ten year olds , the number has quadrupled .
doctors warn that obesity in children and youth raises the risks of developing diabetes , high blood pressure and heart problems later in life .
fat kids today = more obese , ill adults tomorrow last month , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- and the stiftung warentest , an organization which carries out comparison surveys of products and services , used the occasion of berlin 's international agricultural fair , the green week , to urge political leaders and the food industry to recognize the problem of obesity among children and to make countering it a priority .
stiftung warentest and vzbv described the large numbers of overweight children as one of the most important and urgent problems facing nutrition policies in germany today .
" the affected children often suffer the psychological and physical consequences of faulty nutrition for a lifetime .
as a result , the health system must bear costs that reach into the billions , " vzbz chairperson edda müller said .
" these costs will dramatically rise in the near future because an increasing number of overweight children today means more obese and ill adults tomorrow . "
three-pronged approach to fighting fat her message has now reached the ears of some top german politicians .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , renate künast , consumer protection minister and member of the green party , acknowledged what nutritionists have been arguing for years .
" an increasing number of children are too fat , " she said .
" among the 10-year-olds , about 40 percent are massively overweight . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has now announced a three-point program to fight the fat - in the future one warm , nutritious meal will be offered at those schools which offer student lunches ; a new classroom subject , nutrition and consumer protection , will be introduced ; and the food industry will be asked to voluntarily lower the fat content in products aimed at children and youth .
the consumer protection minister emphasized it was important that schools teach children about food and nutrition as well as cooking .
künast said her ministry would help the schools to develop and put together the necessary teaching material for the lessons .
" sensible " proposals but difficult to implement ?
dr. mathilde kersting of the research institute for child nutrition said the minister ’ s proposals are " sensible . "
in an interview with dw-world , she said the state of north-rhine westphalia already did have certain secondary schools where warm meals were offered at noon .
but she admitted that the situation was far from ideal .
" i have my doubts about getting extra personnel and finding the financial resources for them .
it ’ ll be too expensive , " she said with reference to the proposal to set up new school kitchens .
because of budget shortfalls , german schools are currently struggling with just the necessities .
still , kersting welcomed the minister ’ s idea of introducing a nutritional awareness course at schools .
" it ’ s long overdue .
apart from a few primary schools which deal with the topic , the subject is largely ignored in german schools , " she said .

the proposal to ask the food industry to voluntarily lower the fat content in products for children could turn out to be the trickiest issue in künast 's battle against the bulge .

jones was inspired by her mother 's billie holliday records she played her first gig at a local coffee house on her 16th birthday , and won student music awards for her singing , before joining a band called laszlo , playing " dark , jazzy rock " .
she studied jazz piano at the university of north texas , but after two years , in 1999 , took a summer trip to manhattan .
there , she became hooked on the music scene , and stayed in new york , deciding not to return to her course .
i never thought i 'd have a record like this - i thought it would be at least five years before i 'd reach that point norah jones " the music scene is so huge , i found it very exciting , " she said .
" i especially enjoyed hearing amazing songwriters at places like the living room .
everything opened up for me , i could n't leave . "
for a time , she performed with groove-based band wax poetic , and during 2000 she assembled her own group with local songwriter jesse harris and lee alexander .
jones sang and played piano .
that october , they made a demo for legendary jazz label blue note , and on the strength of those recordings and a live showcase , jones was signed three months later .
blue note president bruce lundvall said : " she sings like and angel and plays the piano like her fingers are feathers . "
early recording sessions were dumped as sounding too cluttered and guitar-based .
debut album but a new set with producer and arranger arif mardin , which put more emphasis on jones ' voice , was the one which made it onto her debut album come away with me , released in february 2002 .
jones " sings like an angel " , says her label boss blue note was unsure whether or not the record would fit in its jazz portfolio - but stuck with it , which jones credits her with easing her away from commercial pressures .
" you do n't ever have to sell a million records to be successful in their books , " she said .
" sell 50,000 and you can make another record . "
now the accolades are rolling in .
in november 2002 she featured on the cover of the us edition of vanity fair alongside big name performers alicia keys , sheryl crow , gwen stefani and jennifer lopez .
" i never thought i 'd have a record like this - i thought it would be at least five years before i 'd reach that point .
this is really the record i wanted to make , " she said of her debut .
now , after a triumphant night at the grammys , it will be surprising if jones ever does return to north texas to finish the course she abandoned just over three years ago .
