reuel khoza , chairman of south african-based eskom , said that nuclear power was set to be " progressively important " in meeting customers ' electricity needs .
thanks to research in south africa , backed by firms including electricite de france and the uk 's bnfl , eskom was at the " cutting edge of a new -lsb- nuclear -rsb- technology " .
" nuclear power certainly has a future , " mr khoza , a delegate at the world economic forum 's annual summit in davos , told bbc news online .
" you can not wish it away . "
while nuclear power has been discredited in some circles by events such as the chernobyl disaster , mr khoza noted that it had been " given greater emphasis " by the administration of george w bush .
" in france , 80 % of electricity produced is nuclear based , " mr khoza said .
eskom , the world 's seventh largest utility and responsible for supplying africa with more than half its electricity , was also seeking to boost its reliance on renewable energy sources , he added .
corruption battle demand for eskom electricity is set to increase with economic growth which , in south africa at least , has continued despite the slowdown affecting many larger economies .
mr khoza credited the country 's performance largely to the " sound level " of partnership between government and business .
the country 's clean-up after the end of apartheid a decade ago , and continuing efforts to fight corruption , had also spared it the headline scandals which affected firms such as enron and worldcom .
" by and large , business and political leadership in south africa is at a very high level , " mr khoza said .
an exodus of , typically white and often skilled , workers from south africa had been spurred by unnecessary concerns over the country 's black empowerment programme .
" they have left ... because of misperceptions about what the programme is about , " he said .
" it is a worry . "

2 november 1991 : victoria adjo climbie is born near abidjan , the ivory coast .
november 1998 : seven-year-old victoria adjo climbie leaves abobo in the ivory coast to lives with her aunt , marie-therese kouao initially in paris .
kouao takes the girl to london after she is pursued by french authorities over benefit payments .
april - june 1999 : on arrival in england , victoria 's name is given as anna because of the assumed identity on the false passport used to get her into europe .
kouao takes a job as a hospital cleaner and the pair initially live in a hostel in north london .
some weeks later victoria is on a bus with her aunt when they meet carl manning , the driver , for the first time .
july 1999 : kouao and victoria , who speaks no english , move into carl manning 's home in tottenham , north london .
within days , victoria would be suffering abuse at the hands of carl manning .
that abuse would lead to her torture and death .
14 july 1999 : kouao : pretended to care for victoria victoria makes her first visit to the central middlesex hospital after the daughter of her childminder suspects the girl has non-accidental injuries .
the doctor accepts kouao 's story that victoria has inflicted the wounds on herself by scratching at scabies sores .
during this period , doctors alert child protection authorities as a precaution .
haringey social worker lisa arthurworrey and pc karen jones are assigned to the case .
they later cancel a home visit scheduled for 4 august after hearing about the scabies .
24 july 1999 : victoria is taken to north middlesex hospital 's casualty department with scalding to her head and face .
doctors immediately suspect that the injuries have been deliberately inflicted .
kouao tells lisa arthu4worrey and pc jones that she poured hot water over victoria to try and stop her scratching her scalp .
she says that victoria caused other injuries with utensils .
6 august 1999 : victoria is discharged from the hospital and is collected by kouao after her explanation for the injuries is accepted by child protection authorities .
october 1999 trial evidence reveals that from october 1999 until the following january , carl manning forces victoria to sleep in a bin liner in the bath every night at this flat .
1 november 1999l : kouao tells social workers that carl manning has sexually assaulted victoria .
she withdraws the accusation the next day .
pc jones is asked to investigate why but takes no further action after her letter to kouao remains unanswered .

doctors later transfer her to an intensive care ward at st mary 's hospital in west london .
25 february 2000 : victoria is declared dead at 3.15pm at st mary 's hospital .
dr nathaniel carey , the home office pathologist who examines her body , finds 128 separate injuries and scars , many of them cigarette burns , and describes them as " the worst case of child abuse i 've encountered " .
the climbie trial carl manning and marie therese kouao are charged with the murder of victoria climbie .
during police interviews both claim that victoria was possessed .
november 2000 : the trial opens with the prosecution making it clear that the blame lay not only with kouao and manning in the dock but child protection authorities who had been " blindingly incompetent " .
manning denies murder but pleads guilty to child cruelty and manslaughter .
kouao denies all charges .
12 january 2001 : almost a year after victoria climbie 's death , manning and kouao are found guilty of her murder .
sentencing both of them to life imprisonment , judge richard hawkins says : " what anna endured was truly unimaginable .
she died at both your hands , a lonely drawn out death " .
the inquiry april 2001 : the government announces a public inquiry into the death to be headed by lord laming .
the inquiry is the first in britain to use special wide-ranging powers to look at everything from the role of social services to police child protection arrangements .
ministers make clear that they expect the inquiry to scrutinise the child protection system and not just the failings in the climbie case .
may 2001 : lord laming opens the inquiry and in an unprecedented move calls both marie therese kouao and carl manning to give evidence .
he says the killers should appear at the inquiry to help it establish where the authorities failed to stop them .
the inquiry is split into two parts .
you can read the key stories on the victoria climbie special report .
the first part or phase takes the testimony of more than 230 witnesses including neighbours , child protection officers and high-ranking social services officials .
during this phase , the inquiry heard allegations of racism , incompetence and agencies neglecting their duty of care to victoria .
the inquiry hears of 12 occasions when agencies could have intervened and possibly saved the girl 's life .
the second part during 2002 uses a series of special one-day seminars to bring invited experts together to debate the nature of the child protection system and help lord laming draw up his conclusions .
july 2002 lord laming reopens the first phase of the inquiry after it emerges that a critical document by social services inspectors had not been revealed to his team .
august 2002 carole baptiste , one of the key social workers in the case , is found guilty of failing to attend the public inquiry and fined $ 500 .
november 2002 two further social workers at the heart of the victoria climbie child abuse scandal are sacked for gross misconduct .
lisa arthurworrey and her manager angella mairs are dismissed by haringey council in north london following disciplinary proceedings . : at-a-glance 12 missed chances to save victoria full coverage key stories major reforms sought chain of neglect inquiry 's legacy background the reaction case timeline missed chances a life of horror child care trusts the trial guilty of murder scabies scared police ' tortured ' to death talking point are safeguards now in place ?

july 1999 : kouao and victoria , who speaks no english , move into carl manning 's home in tottenham , north london .
within days , victoria would be suffering abuse at the hands of carl manning .
that abuse would lead to her torture and death .
14 july 1999 : victoria makes her first visit to the central middlesex hospital after the daughter of her childminder suspects the girl has non-accidental injuries .
the doctor accepts kouao 's story that victoria has inflicted the wounds on herself by scratching at scabies sores .
during this period , doctors alert child protection authorities as a precaution .
haringey social worker lisa arthurworrey and pc karen jones are assigned to the case .
they later cancel a home visit scheduled for 4 august after hearing about the scabies .
24 july 1999 : victoria is taken to north middlesex hospital 's casualty department with scalding to her head and face .
doctors immediately suspect that the injuries have been deliberately inflicted .
kouao tells lisa arthu4worrey and pc jones that she poured hot water over victoria to try and stop her scratching her scalp .
she says that victoria caused other injuries with utensils .
6 august 1999 : victoria is discharged from the hospital and is collected by kouao after her explanation for the injuries is accepted by child protection authorities .
october 1999 trial evidence reveals that from october 1999 until the following january , carl manning forces victoria to sleep in a bin liner in the bath every night at this flat .
1 november 1999l : kouao tells social workers that carl manning has sexually assaulted victoria .
she withdraws the accusation the next day .
pc jones is asked to investigate why but takes no further action after her letter to kouao remains unanswered .
24 february 2000 victoria is rushed to north middlesex hospital suffering from a combination of malnutrition and hypothermia .
doctors later transfer her to an intensive care ward at st mary 's hospital in west london .
25 february 2000 : victoria is declared dead at 3.15pm at st mary 's hospital .
dr nathaniel carey , the home office pathologist who examines her body , finds 128 separate injuries and scars , many of them cigarette burns , and describes them as " the worst case of child abuse i 've encountered " .
the climbie trial carl manning and marie therese kouao are charged with the murder of victoria climbie .
during police interviews both claim that victoria was possessed .
november 2000 : the trial opens with the prosecution making it clear that the blame lay not only with kouao and manning in the dock but child protection authorities who had been " blindingly incompetent " .
manning denies murder but pleads guilty to child cruelty and manslaughter .
kouao denies all charges .
12 january 2001 : almost a year after victoria climbie 's death , manning and kouao are found guilty of her murder .
sentencing both of them to life imprisonment , judge richard hawkins says : " what anna endured was truly unimaginable .
she died at both your hands , a lonely drawn out death " .
the inquiry april 2001 : the government announces a public inquiry into the death to be headed by lord laming .
the inquiry is the first in britain to use special wide-ranging powers to look at everything from the role of social services to police child protection arrangements .
ministers make clear that they expect the inquiry to scrutinise the child protection system and not just the failings in the climbie case .
may 2001 : lord laming opens the inquiry and in an unprecedented move calls both marie therese kouao and carl manning to give evidence .
he says the killers should appear at the inquiry to help it establish where the authorities failed to stop them .
the inquiry is split into two parts .
you can read the key stories on the victoria climbie special report .
the first part or phase takes the testimony of more than 230 witnesses including neighbours , child protection officers and high-ranking social services officials .
during this phase , the inquiry heard allegations of racism , incompetence and agencies neglecting their duty of care to victoria .
the inquiry hears of 12 occasions when agencies could have intervened and possibly saved the girl 's life .
the second part during 2002 uses a series of special one-day seminars to bring invited experts together to debate the nature of the child protection system and help lord laming draw up his conclusions .
july 2002 lord laming reopens the first phase of the inquiry after it emerges that a critical document by social services inspectors had not been revealed to his team .
august 2002 carole baptiste , one of the key social workers in the case , is found guilty of failing to attend the public inquiry and fined $ 500 .
november 2002 two further social workers at the heart of the victoria climbie child abuse scandal are sacked for gross misconduct .
lisa arthurworrey and her manager angella mairs are dismissed by haringey council in north london following disciplinary proceedings .

reuel khoza , chairman of south african-based eskom , said that nuclear power was set to be " progressively important " in meeting customers ' electricity needs .
reuel khoza : nuclear dreams thanks to research in south africa , backed by firms including electricite de france and the uk 's bnfl , eskom was at the " cutting edge of a new -lsb- nuclear -rsb- technology " .
" nuclear power certainly has a future , " mr khoza , a delegate at the world economic forum 's annual summit in davos , told bbc news online .
" you can not wish it away . "
while nuclear power has been discredited in some circles by events such as the chernobyl disaster , mr khoza noted that it had been " given greater emphasis " by the administration of george w bush .
" in france , 80 % of electricity produced is nuclear based , " mr khoza said .
eskom , the world 's seventh largest utility and responsible for supplying africa with more than half its electricity , was also seeking to boost its reliance on renewable energy sources , he added .
corruption battle demand for eskom electricity is set to increase with economic growth which , in south africa at least , has continued despite the slowdown affecting many larger economies .
mr khoza credited the country 's performance largely to the " sound level " of partnership between government and business .
the country 's clean-up after the end of apartheid a decade ago , and continuing efforts to fight corruption , had also spared it the headline scandals which affected firms such as enron and worldcom .
" by and large , business and political leadership in south africa is at a very high level , " mr khoza said .
an exodus of , typically white and often skilled , workers from south africa had been spurred by unnecessary concerns over the country 's black empowerment programme .
" they have left ... because of misperceptions about what the programme is about , " he said .
" it is a worry . "

opinion on sally clark was polarised during her trial and her subsequent campaign to quash her conviction .
mrs clark , 38 , from wilmslow , cheshire , was convicted of murder at chester crown court in november 1999 .
we were meant to have children and i loved them so much i could n't believe it happened twice . "
sally clark she denied smothering her sons , eight-week-old harry , and christopher , aged 11 weeks , and said they must have died of " cot death syndrome " .
the crown portrayed her as a " lonely drunk " who missed her well-paid job as a solicitor and resented her children for keeping her at home .
but her supporters say she always loved her children and was supported by her husband stephen .
mrs clark herself told the trial : " we were meant to have children and i loved them so much i could n't believe it happened twice . "
she gave birth to a third child after harry 's death , who is now being cared for by her husband .
statistics the crux of the case revolved around whether it was conceivable the " cot deaths " of two of mrs clark 's children were coincidences .
eminent paediatrician professor sir roy meadow , who appeared for the prosecution , estimated the likelihood of two siblings dying of " cot death syndrome " were one in 73 million .
husband stephen has campaigned for his wife 's freedom this was damning evidence against mrs clark .

opinion on sally clark was polarised during her trial and her subsequent campaign to quash her conviction .
mrs clark , 38 , from wilmslow , cheshire , was convicted of murder at chester crown court in november 1999 . "
we were meant to have children and i loved them so much i could n't believe it happened twice . "
" sally clark she denied smothering her sons , eight-week-old harry , and christopher , aged 11 weeks , and said they must have died of " cot death syndrome " .
the crown portrayed her as a " lonely drunk " who missed her well-paid job as a solicitor and resented her children for keeping her at home .
but her supporters say she always loved her children and was supported by her husband stephen .
mrs clark herself told the trial : " we were meant to have children and i loved them so much i could n't believe it happened twice . "
she gave birth to a third child after harry 's death , who is now being cared for by her husband .
statistics the crux of the case revolved around whether it was conceivable the " cot deaths " of two of mrs clark 's children were coincidences .
eminent paediatrician professor sir roy meadow , who appeared for the prosecution , estimated the likelihood of two siblings dying of " cot death syndrome " were one in 73 million .
this was damning evidence against mrs clark .
but her husband and supporters took issue with sir roy 's evidence .
they were supported by the royal statistical society , which took the unprecedented step of writing to the lord chancellor stating " there was no statistical basis " for the figure .

oil prices are still up almost a third from mid-november on concerns that hostilities in iraq could upset oil supplies from the middle east while production in venezuela is crippled .
an icy arctic wind sweeping across the eastern united states over the past two weeks has also boosted prices by lifting heating demand .

the scottish parliament has been hearing an appeal from conservationists who want to protect the hedgehogs .
the board of scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- sanctioned the slaughter in an effort to help preserve rare birds on the uist isles .
the hedgehogs are due to be killed by lethal injection in a few weeks time .
members of the british hedgehog preservation society -lrb- bhps -rrb- appeared before the parliament 's petitions committee in edinburgh on tuesday .
the hedgehogs are accused of eating the eggs of rare waders during the breeding season , causing a drop in the waders ' numbers .
the conservationists want the chance to collect and move the hedgehogs to new homes on the mainland before extermination begins .
snh told the committee it was prepared to seek ways of saving some of the animals but insisted the society 's proposals were not based on robust evidence .
snh deputy chairman michael scott ruled out delaying the cull , but said only 200 of the animals were expected to be caught this year .
he said snh was due to meet bhps and other animal welfare groups next week in a bid to find a way forward on the issue .
however , he said the expert advice to snh to date was that transportation was likely to cause " most suffering to the animals " .
relocation the society 's kay bullen told bbc news : " we 're suggesting instead of culling them , taking them off the island and putting them on mainland britain .
" we believe this can be done without having a detrimental effect on either the hedgehogs being relocated or the mainland population . "
she said such a mass hedgehog relocation had not been done before , but hedgehogs were regularly taken in from the wild , nursed and released .
a handful of hedgehogs were first introduced to the uists in 1974 to help control slugs and snails in islanders ' gardens .

clay companies imerys - formerly english china clay - and watts blake bearne -lrb- wbb -rrb- had rights to quarry 400 acres of shaugh moor and the blackabrook valley , one of the most popular parts of dartmoor .
the rights , granted in 1951 , were worth tens of millions of pounds because of the rarity and quality of the unique china clay deposits there .
but two years ago , the companies gave them up , without claiming compensation .
white heaps dartmoor national park authority is to award them the prestigious edward moorshead award for " significant contributions " to dartmoor .
imerys said it was a recognition of their sensitivity to environmental issues .
the army continues to use vast areas of dartmoor but the dartmoor preservation association , who led a campaign against the quarrying , said the firms had had little choice .
an independent study into quarrying in the area had concluded that was no way they could quarry the area , which includes bronze age settlements , in an environmentally friendly manner .
the china clay industry on dartmoor continues to attract controversy elsewhere .
at lee moor on south dartmoor , extraction by open-cast mining leaves unsightly white heaps of waste .
granite and limestone is also quarried on dartmoor .
other pressures on dartmoor include the military who won a controversial extension for training earlier this month .

a widely-leaked un report on the humanitarian consequences of a war has estimated that the conflict would create two million refugees .
in mid-january , the turkish red crescent society began preparations for the large number of refugees expected to cross into turkey - a 24,000-tent refugee camp is planned .
un estimates 16 million or 60 % of iraqis dependent on government rations two million refugees expected -lrb- half inside iraq -rrb- 500,000 people will need medical treatment in early stages of war two million children and one million pregnant or lactating women will need immediate " therapeutic feeding " these dire warnings reflect widespread concerns over the effects that any us-led war could have on the iraqi people .
they are based on previous experience and on studies of the current state of health of iraqis and how they are getting food .
despite these warnings , the un refugee agency , the unhcr , has admitted to bbc news online that its preparations are in the initial stages and " in terms of scope they are not really on a large scale " .
during the 1991 gulf war turkey received 500,000 of the 1.8 million refugees went on the move .
nearly a million crossed into iran .
the overall death toll among iraqi civilians 12 years ago is hotly disputed .
estimates for civilian deaths as a direct result of the war range from 100,000 to 200,000 .
in a sustained war this time around , the expectation among aid organisations and un agencies is that the casualty and refugee figures will be higher because the aim of the war will be regime change .
all this assumes that non-conventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction are not used .
food rations the fear that large numbers of iraqis will starve comes from the assessment that the system of government food rations on which many iraqis depend will be severely disrupted .
the problem is we are trying to prepare for something in iraq while we have real , existing crises on out plate in the ivory coast and afghanistan .
these real , rather than hypothetical , operations are themselves out of money chris janovski , unhcr more than 60 % of iraqis , 16 million people , are dependent on government rations , the un estimates .
under the un oil-for-food deal in place since 1996 , iraq has used oil sales to cover around 70 % of its food needs .
mike rowson , the director for british health charity medact , told bbc news online that the iraqi people as a whole are far less healthy than they were before the 1991 gulf war .
this means they will be more vulnerable to the illness and distress caused by war and being forced on the move .
the main problems are likely to be : the immediate injuries and deaths from a bombing campaign civilian deaths and illness from the damage done to essential infrastructure such as water and electricity supplies health services in iraq , already overstretched , can be expected to be overwhelmed .
these conditions are likely to create , mr rowson says , widespread epidemic disease and hunger .
possible scenarios in a report released in 2002 , medact tried to assess the most likely scenario for a war in iraq and then estimated the likely casualties .
" war is unpredictable , but planning must try to use evidence gained from previous conflicts and comparable situations to make these kinds of estimates , " mr rowson said .
it is astonishing to us how little the potential humanitarian effects of war are discussed either in parliament or in the media - there should be a full and open assessment of the likely costs followed by a public debate about the implications of this assessment mike rowson , medact " we know that the iraqi population is much weaker than a decade ago , so the death toll of up to 200,000 from the 1991 war could be higher ; this pessimistic scenario should be coupled with the fact that war could be even more intense because its aim is regime change and saddam hussein may well fight on to the bitter end . "
depending on what kind of conflict it turns out to be and how long it lasts , medact estimates civilian deaths as a direct result of fighting and bombing could range from 48,000 to over 260,000 .
" it is astonishing to us how little the potential humanitarian effects of war are discussed either in parliament or in the media - there should be a full and open assessment of the likely costs followed by a public debate about the implications of this assessment , " mr rowson told bbc news online .
preparations when asked what preparations the uk government was making for the humanitarian consequences of a war , the department for international development was able to say only that the government was " planning for all eventualities " .
the un 's refugee agency , the unhcr , told bbc news online that its preparations were of a general nature and at an initial stage .
existing refugees crises , like that in afghanistan , are the unhcr 's focus " the point is that we do n't know what the humanitarian consequences will be .
if there is some sort of military intervention , we have absolutely no idea what is going to happen .
nonetheless we have to be ready in broad terms , " unhcr spokesman chris janovski said .
being ready means buying tents , sheeting , blankets , and non-perishable foods and medicines that are needed for any refugee crisis and stockpiling them in the countries neighbouring iraq .
mr janovski said : " we are making preparations , but in terms of scope they are not really on a large scale .
this is linked to the fact that we are out of money .
we have spent close to $ 19m from various emergency funds for basic preparations and this is really it .
