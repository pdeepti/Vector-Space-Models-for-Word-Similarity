the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .
" the eu already has protective measures against u.s. beef imports .
we think our measures are sufficient at the moment . "
stringent controls already in place the 15-nation eu , which has considerable experience with the devastating disease also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- , has banned for years the import of most u.s. beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the existing measures were implemented by brussels in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in britain in 1996 , which forced a mass culling of cattle in europe .
" the united states was classified as an ' at risk country ' at the time of the united kingdom crisis and so we 've had restrictions on the import of certain beef ... for years now , " mochan told afp .
mochan also pointed out that u.s. exports to the eu are " not significant " and added that " what we import is top-end , high-quality stuff . "
the european beef industry suffered massive losses when mad cow disease broke out there in the 1990s .
british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .
since then cases of the disease have been reported in france , germany , austria , finland , greece and luxembourg , according to the office of the european commissioner for health and consumer protection .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of vcjd , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from vcjd patients .
britain offers help given its considerable expertise in dealing with the outbreak , britain has offered the americans help in coping with the crisis .
britain ’ s department of environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was standing by to aid its u.s. counterparts .

british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .

the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 listening for the beagle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists hope this british telescope can track the missing beagle .
the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .
" the eu already has protective measures against u.s. beef imports .
we think our measures are sufficient at the moment . "
stringent controls already in place the 15-nation eu , which has considerable experience with the devastating disease also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- , has banned for years the import of most u.s. beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the existing measures were implemented by brussels in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in britain in 1996 , which forced a mass culling of cattle in europe .
" the united states was classified as an ' at risk country ' at the time of the united kingdom crisis and so we 've had restrictions on the import of certain beef ... for years now , " mochan told afp .
mochan also pointed out that u.s. exports to the eu are " not significant " and added that " what we import is top-end , high-quality stuff . "
the european beef industry suffered massive losses when mad cow disease broke out there in the 1990s .
british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .
since then cases of the disease have been reported in france , germany , austria , finland , greece and luxembourg , according to the office of the european commissioner for health and consumer protection .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of vcjd , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from vcjd patients .
britain offers help given its considerable expertise in dealing with the outbreak , britain has offered the americans help in coping with the crisis .
britain ’ s department of environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was standing by to aid its u.s. counterparts .
" we ’ re willing to give our advice on the disease if required , based on the knowledge we have , " a defra spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. experts have also flown a tissue sample of the infected dairy cow to an animal laboratory in england for additional confirmation .
nightmare for u.s. cattle industry experts believe the bse case will deal a heavy blow to the $ 27 billion u.s. cattle industry .
japan and south korea , leading buyers of u.s. beef , have already stopped imports along with south africa , singapore , malaysia , hong kong , taiwan , russia and ukraine .
" it is a big deal , " joe kropf , livestock analyst with kropf and consulting told reuters .
" consumers cut back on consumption and countries , for safety reasons , embargo beef from affected countries . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .
" the eu already has protective measures against u.s. beef imports .
we think our measures are sufficient at the moment . "
stringent controls already in place the 15-nation eu , which has considerable experience with the devastating disease also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- , has banned for years the import of most u.s. beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the existing measures were implemented by brussels in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in britain in 1996 , which forced a mass culling of cattle in europe .
" the united states was classified as an ' at risk country ' at the time of the united kingdom crisis and so we 've had restrictions on the import of certain beef ... for years now , " mochan told afp .
mochan also pointed out that u.s. exports to the eu are " not significant " and added that " what we import is top-end , high-quality stuff . "
the european beef industry suffered massive losses when mad cow disease broke out there in the 1990s .
british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .
since then cases of the disease have been reported in france , germany , austria , finland , greece and luxembourg , according to the office of the european commissioner for health and consumer protection .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of vcjd , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from vcjd patients .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .

struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .

in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .

british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .

the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .
" the eu already has protective measures against u.s. beef imports .
we think our measures are sufficient at the moment . "
stringent controls already in place the 15-nation eu , which has considerable experience with the devastating disease also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- , has banned for years the import of most u.s. beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 listening for the beagle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists hope this british telescope can track the missing beagle .
the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .

pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.12.2003 opposition to military cuts grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's army faces a serious downsizing the defense ministry wants to cut the bundeswehr by 30,000 soldiers by 2010 , but critics say it will be difficult for the country to fulfill its international defense obligations with a pared down military . as the new year approaches , germany ’ s opposition conservatives warn that the defense ministry ’ s plans for the restructuring of the national armed forces in 2004 are not worth the paper they ’ re written on .
criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .
" we hope the mission is going to be an even greater success yet . " dw staff with material from wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .

british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .

the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .

following the detection of the first likely case of mad cow disease in the u.s. on wednesday , the european union , which has banned the import of most american beef for years , has adopted a wait and see attitude . the european union on wednesday maintained a calm front as news emerged of a single holstein on a washington state farm testing positive for mad cow disease .
the incident , the first of its kind in the united states , triggered a panic reaction around the world as importers moved to slap bans on u.s. beef and shares in american fast food outlets plummeted .
the eu said it was closely following developments in the u.s. but was not considering tightening existing protective measures .
" we are keeping a close eye on the situation , " european commission spokeswoman antonia mochan told reuters .
" the eu already has protective measures against u.s. beef imports .
we think our measures are sufficient at the moment . "
stringent controls already in place the 15-nation eu , which has considerable experience with the devastating disease also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- , has banned for years the import of most u.s. beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the existing measures were implemented by brussels in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in britain in 1996 , which forced a mass culling of cattle in europe .
" the united states was classified as an ' at risk country ' at the time of the united kingdom crisis and so we 've had restrictions on the import of certain beef ... for years now , " mochan told afp .
mochan also pointed out that u.s. exports to the eu are " not significant " and added that " what we import is top-end , high-quality stuff . "
the european beef industry suffered massive losses when mad cow disease broke out there in the 1990s .
british farmers slaughtered about 3.7 million cattle to try to stem the bse outbreak .
since then cases of the disease have been reported in france , germany , austria , finland , greece and luxembourg , according to the office of the european commissioner for health and consumer protection .
the illness is believed to cause a form of creutzfeld jakob disease , or vcjd , in humans thought to be linked to eating bse-infected beef products such as diseased brain or spinal column material .
at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died of vcjd , either through eating beef or having received blood or tissue transplants from vcjd patients .
britain offers help given its considerable expertise in dealing with the outbreak , britain has offered the americans help in coping with the crisis .
britain ’ s department of environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was standing by to aid its u.s. counterparts .
" we ’ re willing to give our advice on the disease if required , based on the knowledge we have , " a defra spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. experts have also flown a tissue sample of the infected dairy cow to an animal laboratory in england for additional confirmation .
nightmare for u.s. cattle industry experts believe the bse case will deal a heavy blow to the $ 27 billion u.s. cattle industry .
japan and south korea , leading buyers of u.s. beef , have already stopped imports along with south africa , singapore , malaysia , hong kong , taiwan , russia and ukraine .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .
many believe there ’ s no justice in a system under which only some of the eligible young people are drafted , while the majority wouldn ’ t have to serve . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr afghanistan expansion met with threats germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz .

criticism has focused on the lack of financial means to support structural reforms that would prepare the forces better for peacekeeping and enforcement missions abroad .
shrinking budget , shrinking force social democratic defense minister peter struck -lrb- photo -rrb- had to acknowledge earlier this year that the defense budget would be capped at around € 24 billion until 2006 .
that ’ s less than 1.5 percent of the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck national budget .
it also goes against calls by washington and nato for members of the military alliance to increase future joint military operations , especially in fighting against international terrorism .
the defense minister plans to cut the forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings .
opposition : ' cuts alarming ' in an interview with the german news agency ddp , the opposition christian democratic union ’ s defense policy spokesman , christian schmidt , called the planned personnel and equipment cuts highly alarming .
he said the restructuring , to be supervised by top military officer wolfgang schneiderhahn , would result in a fiasco with the scarce resources at hand .
the cdu estimates that the forces will even have to reduce the number of professionals by another 20,000 .
schmidt says any more troops couldn ’ t be financed under the budget .
meanwhile , the head of the armed forces employee ’ s association , bernhard gertz , has warned that the number of troops can ’ t be reduced endlessly , especially at a time when the bundeswehr is expected to be deployed on new missions and provide even better performance .
" you can ’ t give endless quality instead of quantity , " gertz told deutsche welle .
" you have to have quantity , too .
so this goal of 250,000 soldiers is an operative minimum .
if we reach this goal , we would still have about 130,000 soldiers for engagement in , for example , afghanistan or in the balkans , but that wouldn ’ t be much more than today . "
a simmering conscription debate schmidt is also wary of the defense minister ’ s intention to reform the forces so that they could be turned easily into a fully professional army .
peter struck himself is known to be a staunch supporter of the current conscription-based army , but is aware of mounting opposition to conscription within his own social democrat ranks and even more within the greens , the junior government partner .
the greens ’ most prominent figure , foreign minister joschka fischer said struck could go down in german history by ushering in the end to conscription , which was introduced in post world war ii west germany in 1955 .
struck himself demanded last week that the issue be raised again during a special parliamentary debate early next year .
he personally doubts that a professional army will be cheaper as the opponents of conscription claim .
but other factors have to be taken into consideration as well .
in line with the planned reduction in troop strength , a maximum of 50,000 soldiers , down from around 80,000 today , will be drafted each year starting in 2004 .

the fate of the european space agency ’ s beagle 2 mars lander has become increasingly uncertain after the failure of two successive attempts to pick up the probe ’ s signal . on christmas night , scientists at the observatory at jodrall banks near manchester , england , attempted to track the location of the beagle lander without success .
the next opportunity for contact will come on friday when nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter again crosses over the beagle ’ s landing area at about 7:14 p.m.
cet .
the jodrell bank observatory will have another opportunity to listen for the beagle ’ s relatively weak 5 watt signal between 11:40 p.m. and 12:20 a.m.
friday night .
meanwhile , a radio telescope at stanford university will aid in the search starting on saturday .
if all else fails , beagle 2 ’ s mother ship , the mars express orbiter , will fly over the landing site during the first week of january .
express is the only device that has been specifically programmed to communicate with the beagle lander .
" the hope is strong that the mars express orbiter will be successful in this task , " esa officials said in a statement .
european space officials have sought to assuage fears that the beagle was destroyed on impact or disintegrated entering the martian atmosphere , but concern is growing that it may have been lost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor colin pillinger during a press conference friday morning , the beagle ’ s creator , colin pillinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , outlined possible reasons for the failure to pick up a signal from the beagle .
it may have crashed , landed in the wrong place , it could have failed to open its lid or its antenna could be facing in the wrong direction .
pillinger said it ’ s also possible there are problems with the onboard clock that automatically turns the lander ’ s radio signal on and off .
if the clock has changed , the telescopes and probes trying to track the beagle ’ s signal could be doing so at the wrong times .
despite increasingly grim prospects and the fact that two-thirds of all previous mars missions have failed , scientists involved in the project are not giving up hope yet .
' it 's lke waiting for a response to a love letter ' " we 're still early days in extra time , " pillinger told reporters .
" so we ’ re not concerned about not being able to contact it . "
he said the lander could survive for weeks or months on its automated systems , which would still give esa scientists plenty of time to track it .
" if we can contact it , we can pull this thing round .
but it 's very much like ... sending somebody a love letter .
you know they 've got it and you 're waiting for their response . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beagle 2 lander on mars .
esa officials said the british-made beagle 2 should have landed on mars at around 3:52 a.m.
cet on thursday morning .
the lander should have touched down in isidis planitia , a relatively flat area near the martian equator that may have once been the site of water .
if it landed safely and scientists eventually make contact with it , the beagle 2 will " scratch and sniff " the surface of mars using an array of tools for collecting and analyzing soil and rock samples in its search for signs of life .
core of mission still intact although the beagle lander could prove to be the mission ’ s true audience pleaser , delivering photos from the martian surface and tantalizing details about the planet ’ s composition reminiscent of nasa 's successful mars pathfinder mission in 1997 , it still only represents 10 percent of the total scientific experiments the € 300 million mars express project is expected to undertake .
the vast majority will be conducted by the mars express orbiter , which is equipped with a stereo camera and a radar capable of penetrating the martian surface and will study the atmosphere and composition of mars in an effort to search for water .
the orbiter has successfully entered its intended orbit and will now circle the planet for two years .
" the landing probe on mars is in essence the icing on the cake , " gerhard schwehm , an esa planetary mission official in darmstadt told the associated press .
" for the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission . "
augustin chicarro , the mission ’ s scientific director said other instruments on the orbiter would provide " very interesting images , with a global coverage of the planet , which does not exist at present . "
meanwhile , germany ’ s top research official , who was present in darmstadt during the landing window on christmas morning , also praised the success of mars express .
" mars express has been a great success as it is in a stable and very good orbit , " said research and technology minister edelgard bulmahn .

chief election commissioner james lyngdoh , who leaves office in two months , told the bbc that not one of them was committed to democracy .
the plain-speaking commissioner has been widely credited with holding a largely peaceful and fair election in indian-administered kashmir last year .
in july , he was awarded one of asia 's most prestigious honours , the ramon magsaysay awards , for what the organisers described as his convincing validation of free elections .
mr lyngdoh told bbc world television 's hard talk india programme that the indian political system was under threat of being " killed " by its elected representatives .
" they are cheating all the time , " he said .
there are very few who talk to you on equal terms as a human being james lyngdoh chief election commissioner " democracy means basically individual freedom and that you respect individual freedom to the utmost extent .
" i ca n't think of any -lsb- politician -rsb- who is that involved in individual freedom , " mr lyngdoh said .
' uneducated and impolite ' the present lot of indian politicians are by and large uneducated and impolite , he added .
" there are very few who talk to you on equal terms as a human being .
" either they have their noses stuck in the air or they prostrate at somebody 's feet - and there 's nothing in between . "
after last year 's religious violence in india 's gujarat state , in which more than 1,000 people died , mr lyngdoh chastised local officials for playing down the attacks , calling them " jokers " .
in his bbc interview , mr lyngdoh defended his language but regretted that the comment became public .
" the anger was perfectly justified but maybe i should have been more aware of the mikes and the media around me , " he said .
in a parting message to the indian public before his retirement , mr lyndoh urged them to put pressure on politicians and their parties to make free and fair elections a fundamental right under the indian constitution .

in july , he was awarded one of asia 's most prestigious honours , the ramon magsaysay awards , for what the organisers described as his convincing validation of free elections .
mr lyngdoh told bbc world television 's hard talk india programme that the indian political system was under threat of being " killed " by its elected representatives .
" they are cheating all the time , " he said .
there are very few who talk to you on equal terms as a human being james lyngdoh chief election commissioner " democracy means basically individual freedom and that you respect individual freedom to the utmost extent .
" i ca n't think of any -lsb- politician -rsb- who is that involved in individual freedom , " mr lyngdoh said .
' uneducated and impolite ' the present lot of indian politicians are by and large uneducated and impolite , he added .
" there are very few who talk to you on equal terms as a human being .
" either they have their noses stuck in the air or they prostrate at somebody 's feet - and there 's nothing in between . "
after last year 's religious violence in india 's gujarat state , in which more than 1,000 people died , mr lyngdoh chastised local officials for playing down the attacks , calling them " jokers " .
in his bbc interview , mr lyngdoh defended his language but regretted that the comment became public .
" the anger was perfectly justified but maybe i should have been more aware of the mikes and the media around me , " he said .
in a parting message to the indian public before his retirement , mr lyndoh urged them to put pressure on politicians and their parties to make free and fair elections a fundamental right under the indian constitution .

the men had expected to learn their fate at egypt 's emergency high state security court on thursday but their case was adjourned until 25 march .
maajid nawaz , of essex , and londoners ian nisbet and reza pankhurst say they were tortured into signing confessions .
mr pankhurst 's wife , hodan , said there was no reason for the adjournment .
" it is yet another form of pressure , of abuse and of punishment for a group of innocent people who are not guilty of any crime , " she said .
" we would have been waiting for this verdict for eight months by march unnecessarily so where is the justice ?
" it is very disappointing . "
" there was never any law passed to ban this group " hodan pankhurst the britons , along with 23 egyptians , are accused of trying to revive an islamic liberation party , hizb-ut-tahrir .
the britons , who are all married with children , were seized in a post 11 september crackdown and accused of promoting aims - including the overthrow of the egyptian government .
the prosecution says hizb-ut-tahrir was banned in 1974 following an attempted coup .
but mrs pankhurst told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " there was never any law passed to ban this group . "
the legality of the court and the emergency laws used to detain the men were being contested , she added .
the men had been denied access to lawyers , independent doctors and amnesty international , mrs pankhurst told today .

a trek from the gwynedd village of beddgelert to the top of snowdon and back will also burn away the turkey , gravy , stuffing , sausage wrapped in bacon and christmas pudding that most of us will consume .
professor joe doust of the university of wales aberystwyth says a typical person can expect to eat about 2000 calories in a day .
but a full christmas dinner with all the trimmings , preceded by breakfast , a few sneaky chocolates while watching the queen 's speech , and the usual cold supper can tip the scales at a belt-straining 6000 calories .
the number of calories burned while walking depends on body weight , distance , type of surface and the slope joe doust based on a 2000 calorie christmas dinner , prof doust has calculated that a man weighing 12 stone eight pounds will need to walk 18 miles - or a woman of 9 stone 6 pounds 24 miles - to burn off those excess calories .
alternatively , those who favour the couch potato option will need to watch 33 hours of television , an activity which burns calories at a rate of one per minute .
but the good news for those of us already struggling to see our toes is that a light person will have to walk further than a heavy person to burn off the same number of calories .
long legs " the number of calories burned while walking depends on body weight , distance , type of surface and the slope , " said prof doust .
" also , you will have to walk further on flat land than hilly terrain to burn off the same calories . "
and people with long legs burn more calories than those with short legs , claims prof doust .
" you might take more steps but each one is shorter and needs less energy than the longer steps of a taller person . "
the christmas dinner burn off golf 6 hours 40 minutes football 3 hours 20 minutes swimming 4 hours 10 minutes horse riding 6 hours 30 minutes cycling 4 hours 45 minutes gardening 7 hours housework 7 hours 24 minutes dancing 4 hours 46 minutes fishing 11 hours 42 minutes watching television 33 hours " the calories you burn walking does n't seem a lot , but if you walk on a daily basis the calories soon mount up . "
the academic 's latest work on calories follows on from the aberystwyth calorie map which he published in july 2002 .
the map features 15 walks in and around the seaside town and calculates the average number of calories burned .
since it was launched prof doust and his team have mapped more than 80 walks for clients in the uk ranging from city centres to large forests .
for his christmas walk calculations prof doust assumed a typical winter path where it is wet , muddy in places and windy .
he reckons that someone weighing 70 kg will need to walk 33 km to burn off their christmas dinner and someone weighing 100 kg will need to trudge 23 km .

john kelly , the county council 's emergency planning officer , said : " we have agreed to provide whatever is available at the time but the expected number of evacuees is far beyond what we have dealt with in past evacuations .

the pair gained worldwide recognition in 1999 when they became the first to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon .
now they plan to repeat the journey in a solar-powered aeroplane which will have to use batteries to fly at night .
a feasibility study has confirmed the viability of the solar impulse project and experts are now preparing to design the craft for launch some time in 2006 .
immersive pilots shaped like a glider , the plane will be black and covered in blue photovoltaic cells .
sixty-metre wings and two tail-mounted engines will enable it to take off unassisted and carry the heavy batteries needed to store energy for night flying .
jones and piccard are consulting the world 's best glider and yacht manufacturers to help them source state-of-the-art composite materials .
meanwhile robotics experts at the swiss federal institute of technology , lausanne , are assessing the idea of making the craft interactive with the pilot .
" the design incorporates a computerised body vest , " explains jones .
" if there 's stress on part of the wing , the pilot would feel pressure on one side of his body .
" equally , if the pilot is stressed the plane would sense this and only feed him must-know information . "
press for play as well as pushing the limits of technology , the pair hope the aeroplane will prove the viability of sustainable development .
it will not carry any fossil fuels on board and so will offer completely pollution-free transport .
" the great thing about this project is that it allows us to be a force for good from the beginning , " says jones .
" we want to use it as a communications platform for the concept of sustainable development and renewable energy resources .
" solving our ecological problems is not simply a case of persuading people to turn off the lights and not keep their vcrs on standby .
this may be important but it wo n't solve the situation .
what will solve the situation is technology . "
solar acquaintance jones and piccard 's first aim is to fly the plane at night , something never before achieved in a solar-powered craft .
after that , they hope to recreate historic journeys made in conventional aircraft by the likes of lindberg and amy johnson .
the ultimate goal will be to fly non-stop round the world .
the task that confronts them is a huge one .
the us space agency 's helios project - an advanced solar-powered craft - had been attempting to overcome the hurdle of night flying on batteries when it broke up in a test flight over the pacific this year .
jones , though , is well aware of the technological hurdles he faces .
he was mission controller on the ill-fated qinetiq 1 balloon attempt to take a manned envelope 40 kilometres above the earth 's surface .
the balloon , which ripped on inflation , was to have flown a tethered solar aeroplane , called zephyr 3 , under the gondola .
