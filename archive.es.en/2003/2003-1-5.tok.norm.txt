clashes in the capital caracas on friday left two people dead and dozens injured .
a one-month old general strike aimed at ousting mr chavez has been accompanied by almost daily street protests in many of the nation 's cities .
protesters battled with police officers in caracas to make matters worse , many venezuelans carry guns .
every time supporters and opponents of mr chavez meet on the streets , there is a risk of bloodshed .
bloodshed is exactly what happened on friday , when tens of thousands of opposition marchers arrived at the capital 's main military base , fuerte tiuna , to demand the release of a detained dissident general and military support for the strike .
hundreds of the president 's supporters tried to stop the march reaching the barracks .
they threw stones , bottles and fireworks at the rally .
i saw a young guy with blood pouring out of his stomach from where he had been hit opposition marcher jose boccardo national guard troops fired tear gas and rubber pellets in an attempt to keep the two sides apart .
in the tense stand-off that followed more than a dozen gunshots rang out .
" people threw themselves to the ground , " said opposition marcher , jose boccardo .
" there were at least 15 shots .
they seemed to be coming from the other side .
later i saw a young guy with blood pouring out of his stomach from where he had been hit . "
' dictatorial government ' more than 24 hours , later it is still not clear who started shooting .
the mainly opposition-supporting media have blamed mr chavez ' supporters for the violence , some of whom were caught on camera firing handguns .
chavez supporters are resisting pressure to hold early elections witnesses saw people on both sides with guns once the shooting had started .
police officers may also have fired at demonstrators .
" again , this dictatorial government attacked and repressed the venezuelan people , " said opposition labour leader alfredo ramos .
the government 's education minister aristobolo isturiz said the opposition-controlled metropolitan police were responsible for one of the deaths .
the truth is unlikely to ever come out .
peace shattered almost nine months on from a failed coup attempt against mr chavez , triggered by the deaths of 19 people during street clashes , not a single person has been prosecuted .
neither , for that matter , has anyone been arrested for the deaths of up to 60 others in the two days mr chavez was detained by the military .
the violence shattered what had been a relatively quiet holiday season .
as the strike drags on , venezuelans are putting up with the inconvenience .
the strike has paralysed the country 's main oil industry .
in the worst hit areas , motorists sleep overnight in their cars waiting to fill up their tanks .
in a country where petrol is cheaper than bottled water , people are paying more than 10 times the price for a litre of petrol on the black market .
banks , supermarkets and chemists are opening on restricted hours , and most people had to spend christmas without products such as fresh milk , beer or soft drinks .
chavez defiant the political deadlock looks set to continue .
the opposition have said they will continue the strike until mr chavez resigns .
the venezuelan leader says early elections would be unconstitutional .
he says his foes will have to wait until august when a constitutionally-binding referendum can be held to decided whether he should step down .
the chronic shortage of fuel supplies has not brought the government down .
but the country has lost more than $ 2 bn in lost oil sales , and the government can ill afford to keep haemorrhaging money forever .
nor will venezuelans put up with much more bloodshed .

archbishop desmond tutu his criticism came as preparations for a possible war continued with president george w bush building-up us forces in the gulf , currently totalling around 60,000 troops .
the british government is expected to announce later this week that it is planning to deploy troops to the region , reportedly numbering 27,000 .
mr blair came home from his family holiday in egypt on saturday to be met with the fresh controversy at home from the leading anti-apartheid campaigner .
archbishop tutu - the former head of the south african council of churches - demanded on lwt 's jonathan dimbleby programme : " when does compassion , when does morality , when does caring come in ?
" i just hope that one day that people will realise that peace is a far better path to follow .
" many , many of us are deeply saddened to see a great country such as the united states aided and abetted extraordinarily by britain . "
it was " mind-boggling " the prime minister was showing such support , the archbishop went on .
" i have a great deal of time for your prime minister but i 'm shocked to see a powerful country use its power frequently , unilaterally .
" the united states says you do this to the world , if you do n't do it we will do it - that 's sad . "
archbishop tutu asked why iraq was being singled out when europe , india and pakistan also had weapons of mass destruction .

the tiny islands are among five uninhabited islands known in japanese as the senkaku islands and by china and taiwan as the diaoyu islands .
the chinese government and people have the unswerving determination to safeguard the country 's territorial sovereignty wang yi , china vice foreign minister the islands , which lie between taiwan and the southern japanese islands of okinawa , in the east china sea , are claimed by all three countries and are believed to be rich in oil resources .
the japanese government is reported to have leased the three islands for about 22 million yen -lrb- $ 183,300 -rrb- a year .
last week , the japanese newspaper yomiuri shimbun said the lease was intended to block anyone landing on the islands and to prevent their sale .
both china and taiwan say the contract is invalid and chinese vice foreign minister wang yi urged mr anami to tell tokyo it must give up its plan .
but the ambassador responded by saying that the islands were japanese territory and that china 's claims were groundless , china 's official xinhua news agency reported .
troubled history " the chinese government and people have the unswerving determination to safeguard the country 's territorial sovereignty , " xinhua quoted mr wang as saying .
the islands have been a major sticking point for years mr wang insisted that the islands had belonged to china since ancient times and warned that continuing with the plan could be harmful to the two countries ' bilateral relations .
japan first claimed sovereignty of the islands in 1895 .
they temporarily fell under united states control after world war ii , but were handed back in 1972 along with okinawa .
however , when oil was discovered near the islands in the early 1970s china and taiwan renewed their claims on the territory .
in taiwan , some mps have called for their government to take the dispute to the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- .
the dispute escalated in 1996 when a group of japanese right-wingers travelled to the islands and built a temporary lighthouse there to bolster the japanese ownership claim .
