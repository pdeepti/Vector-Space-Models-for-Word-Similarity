a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 russians go to polls under shadow of terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster for the united russia party poster reads " a strong russia is a united russia . "
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , the party has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president .

leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .

international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , the party has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president .

people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , the party has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”

the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .

money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .
focus on the future once payments are completed , the work of the federal foundation created to deal with compensation issues , “ remembrance , responsibility and the future ” will focus on the “ future ” part of its title . schemes that fall under this category are meant to contribute to awareness about the crimes of the nazis , or provide for the social and psychological well-being of nazi-era victims . approved projects include a scholarship fund for young jewish immigrants to germany from the former soviet union and a foundation to support meetings between young people and holocaust survivors .
money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .
but projects like that can easily exceed € 10 million , and when we have to turn them down , we feel bad about it , but it ’ s just not possible . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .

in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .
7 .
international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "

leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 italians protest pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians turned out in masses to protest pension reforms .
thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .

a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .

a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .

however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .

the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .

north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .

many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

but president putin has vowed to tromp the separatist movement , and this has fueled discontent in the break-away region . the conflict between the chechens and the russians is a centuries-old clash .
when chechnya ’ s southern neighbor , christian georgia , agreed to a union with moscow in 1783 , the muslim north caucasus were encircled and a holy war ensued .
decades later , the caucasus war stretched out for 47 years , finally ending in 1864 . josef stalin , who accused chechens of helping germans during world war ii , sent the entire nation into exile , killing about one-third of them on the trek to kazakhstan . “ when they came back , they never stopped thinking of separatism , but it was impossible during soviet times , ” says gasan gusejnov , an expert on ethnic conflicts in the former soviet union who has taught chechen history and politics at the heinrich heine university in düsseldorf . the separatist movement took off with the collapse of the soviet union and resulted in bloody battles in 1994 and 1995 .
before the fighting began , the population was 1.1 million - two-thirds ethnic chechens and a quarter of them russians .
nearly 400,000 people lived in the capital , grozny , which is now in ruins . tens of thousands of civilians died in the fighting , though accurate figures on the exact death toll are not available .
many chechens live in refugee camps today . anti-separatism a main cause the situation calmed somewhat after a kidnapping in january 1996 prompted the yeltsin regime to make moves toward allowing the creation of a separate state .
that never materialized , however , and when vladimir putin became president , he made anti-separatism a main cause . “ when putin came to power in 1999 , his main message to the population was , ‘ there is a wounded place on the territory of the former soviet union and i will heal this wounded place .
i will stop the separatists once and forever ’ , ” gusejnov explains . while this message was hugely popular among russians , it was a tougher sell in the outside world .
until the attacks on september 11 , 2001 . “ immediately after september 11 , putin decided he could get support for this position because it looks very similar -lrb- to terrorism -rrb- and it is very similar , ” says gusejnov .
“ and no doubt there are contacts between chechens and arab groups or the taliban or al qaeda because it is a shadow world .
and it is a world with huge amounts of weapons . ” in the two years since 9/11 , hundreds of people have died both inside and outside chechnya .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , the party has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president .

world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .

the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .

an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .

in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .

money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .

money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .
focus on the future once payments are completed , the work of the federal foundation created to deal with compensation issues , “ remembrance , responsibility and the future ” will focus on the “ future ” part of its title . schemes that fall under this category are meant to contribute to awareness about the crimes of the nazis , or provide for the social and psychological well-being of nazi-era victims . approved projects include a scholarship fund for young jewish immigrants to germany from the former soviet union and a foundation to support meetings between young people and holocaust survivors .
money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .
but projects like that can easily exceed € 10 million , and when we have to turn them down , we feel bad about it , but it ’ s just not possible . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .
7 .
international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a long history of chechen terror attacks in the last year alone some 250 people in moscow and elsewhere have been killed in bombings linked to chechen separatists .
here is a summary of the most dramatic attacks .
chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .
but president putin has vowed to tromp the separatist movement , and this has fueled discontent in the break-away region .

a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .

the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .
focus on the future once payments are completed , the work of the federal foundation created to deal with compensation issues , “ remembrance , responsibility and the future ” will focus on the “ future ” part of its title . schemes that fall under this category are meant to contribute to awareness about the crimes of the nazis , or provide for the social and psychological well-being of nazi-era victims . approved projects include a scholarship fund for young jewish immigrants to germany from the former soviet union and a foundation to support meetings between young people and holocaust survivors .
money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .
but projects like that can easily exceed € 10 million , and when we have to turn them down , we feel bad about it , but it ’ s just not possible . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .

international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a long history of chechen terror attacks in the last year alone some 250 people in moscow and elsewhere have been killed in bombings linked to chechen separatists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .
7 .
international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .

money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 italians protest pension reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians turned out in masses to protest pension reforms .
thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .

international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .
but “ i ’ ve gotten used to the idea that this probably will not happen anymore , ” he said during an interview last summer . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died one week after her 101st birthday .

"
two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election . going into sunday ’ s parliamentary election , opinion polls show the united russia party leading with 30-40 percent of the vote , far ahead of the opposition communist party .
a sweeping victory by the kremlin-backed party is almost certain and will boost president vladimir putin ’ s standing ahead of next year ’ s presidential election .
but the kremlin ’ s anticipated win has been overshadowed by a suicide bombing on a commuter train in southern russia on friday which killed 42 people and injured more than 170 .
putin said the attack , which has been linked to chechen rebels , was aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of the crucial vote .
in response to the attack , security was tightened at polling booths , train stations and markets across the country .
russia ’ s election chief , alexander veshnyakov , said on state television " unprecedented measures " would be taken to ensure every russian could cast their vote .
low voter interest if voter turnout on sunday is down , fear of a terrorist attack will only be one reason many people chose to stay at home .
in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote , pedrov told dw-radio .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .

the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians also do not see the elections as decisive .
the duma is a relatively weak body whose power has been whittled away during putin ’ s reign .
for many its influence has been virtually taken away as it developed into a rubber stamp parliament .
" the next duma will pass any law , including constitutional ones , including changing the constitution which will not be controlled in any way by civil society , " said irina khakamada , deputy leader of the small liberal union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- .
aiming for a constitutional majority the main question ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its allies can secure 260 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes .
" i think that the kremlin is pushing for a parliamentary majority - perhaps allowing putin to run in 2008 , " said michael mcfaul of the carnegie foundation .
the two-thirds majority would enable putin to change the constitution so he can run again after the end of his likely second term .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " petrov said .
putin , whose approval ratings are around 80 percent , is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , the party has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

more than 1.5 million people have so far received payments totalling € 2.6 billion from a german compensation fund for nazi-era forced laborers .
the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .

the directors of the fund hope their work will be completed by may , 2005 . two years after the start of compensation payments to people forced to work for the nazi regime , approximately half of the money donated by german government and industry to a special compensation fund has been paid out . the director of the fund , dieter kastrup , said that payments should be mostly completed by the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , in may , 2005 . but he admitted that due to the advanced age of many of the claimants , fewer compensation payments are actually benefiting the victims of forced labor . “ unfortunately , it ’ s been confirmed that a growing number of the recipients aren ’ t able to personally receive their payments , ” kastrup said in berlin on thursday .
time running out a recently released report on the progress of the compensation fund states that in up to 15 percent of cases , the claimant can ’ t personally receive their payment because of death , illness , or other reasons . in such cases , the claimant ’ s heirs may receive 6.3 percent of the money . compensation sums range from € 2,556 to € 7,669 . kastrup said such figures mean his staff are working even harder to ensure that as many as 300,000 claimants yet to be compensated receive their payments as quickly as possible . under the nazi regime , millions of people were forced to work for german industry . it ’ s estimated that in august 1944 , every fourth workplace in germany was filled by a forced foreign laborer . the compensation fund , established more than 50 years after world war ii , was created as a reaction to the growing possibility of class action suits in the u.s. directed against german companies that profited from this forced labor .
german government and industry each contributed € 2.56 billion to the fund .
focus on the future once payments are completed , the work of the federal foundation created to deal with compensation issues , “ remembrance , responsibility and the future ” will focus on the “ future ” part of its title . schemes that fall under this category are meant to contribute to awareness about the crimes of the nazis , or provide for the social and psychological well-being of nazi-era victims . approved projects include a scholarship fund for young jewish immigrants to germany from the former soviet union and a foundation to support meetings between young people and holocaust survivors .
money has also been set aside for the care of nazi-era victims in romania , moldavia and the ukraine .
however , foundation board member michael jansen said that funds for such projects are limited .
“ many of the survivors and the victims ’ associations have the sense that this foundation is in a position to respond considerably to the problems and questions they may have , ” jansen said . “ that means that we have many more applications than we can possibly approve , and so disappointments are going to be inevitable . for example , from the very beginning , we had applications asking if we could finance hospitals .

the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .

militants raid russian region of ingushetia current affairs -pipe- 06.12.2003 train bombing overshadows russian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb blast tore a hole in a commuter train in southern russia .
a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region . more than 24 hours after a bomb ripped through a commuter train near the border to chechnya the death toll has risen to 42 .
some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .
we will find them and punish them as the law demands . "
speaking on russian television after the attack , president vladimir putin denounced it as " an attempt to destabilize the situation in the country on the eve of parliamentary elections , " which take place on dec .
7 .
international condemnation european and international leaders have unanimously condemned friday ’ s bombing as an act of terror .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , in a personal letter to putin , said he was shocked to hear of the " cruel attack . "
" this hateful attack should be condemned in the strongest terms , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called the bombing a " despicable act of terror " that " fills us with dismay and outrage . "
the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "
white house press secretary scott mcclellan issued a statement offering condolences to the families of the victims : " we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " he said .
despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .
the president of the european commission , romano prodi , said the eu executive rejected any form of terrorism " whatever the motives and whoever the authors . "
speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .
previously berlusconi had created a stir by accusing the media of " telling tales " about the situation in chechnya , where russian troops have been accused of killing civilians in the war against the separatists .
in a letter to putin , the italian leader wrote " let ’ s deal with the pain together , united in our determination to defeat hatred and violence with the arms of the rule of law and democracy . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a long history of chechen terror attacks in the last year alone some 250 people in moscow and elsewhere have been killed in bombings linked to chechen separatists .
here is a summary of the most dramatic attacks .
chechnya and russia : a history of conflict after fighting in 1994 and 1995 , the situation in chechnya calmed somewhat .
but president putin has vowed to tromp the separatist movement , and this has fueled discontent in the break-away region .
russians go to polls under shadow of terrorism two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .
polls show the kremlin-backed united russia party will come out ahead , strengthening putin ’ s chances for next year ’ s presidential election .

some 200 people have been hospitalized with injuries in the blast which occurred during the main rush hour on friday just outside the southern russian city of yessentuki .
many of the victims were children and students on their way to school and university .
authorities say the blast is the work of suicide bombers , and although they have not explicitly linked the attack to chechen rebels , it is the latest in a long series of bombings that have struck russians in recent years , both inside and outside chechnya .
in the last year alone 250 people were killed in a wave of attacks in moscow and elsewhere which were blamed on the separatists .
however , aslan maskhadov , a rebel leader and former chechen president , has denied chechen responsibility for the train attack and issued a statement condemning acts of violence against civilians .
russian officials have vowed to find those responsible .
" the earth will be burning under their feet , " the interfax news agency quoted russian interior minister boris gryzlov as saying .
" these animals will not feel safe anywhere .

the united states said nothing could justify such a " terrorist act . "

despite european criticism of russia ’ s policies in chechnya , eu leaders made no reference to the kremlin ’ s actions in the break-away republic in their condemnation of the attack .

speaking in brussels , prodi said the blast was aimed at destabilizing the election .
he said the european commission was committed to the fight against world terrorism " side by side with russia and other international partners , in full respect for the rules of law . "
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the bombing another " cowardly " and " barbaric " attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.12.2003 europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a boat 's ride away from europe , north africa is still world 's apart socially and economically .
at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration . on saturday european leaders attending an unprecedented summit in tunis vowed to help north africa overcome poverty and to combat factors that breed islamic extremism .
leaders from the western mediterranean countries , including france , italy , malta , portugal and spain , agreed to bolster economic ties in the region and to " strengthen security cooperation between the arab maghreb union -lrb- amu -rrb- and european union countries . "
the amu , which comprises algeria , libya , mauritania , morocco and tunisia , was established in 1989 , but due to regional rivalries it has been essentially ineffective since its creation .
" it is necessary to bridge the gap of social and economic disparities between the two west mediterranean shores , " the tunis declaration stated .
although short on specifics , the text adopted after the two-day summit , called for the creation of a maghreb free trade zone .
french president jacques chirac called upon the states in north africa to put aside their disputes with one another and work together with the eu in developing a " zone of peace , cooperation , security and stability . "
chirac said better regional integration in the maghreb would allow it " to fully benefit from its trade association with the european union . "
in exchange for improving economic ties with north africa , the european leaders stressed that its southern counterparts must share part of the burden and increase efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants heading to europe .
washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .

washing up on europe ’ s shores bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish civil guards .
the illegal aliens were trying to reach the southern spanish port of tarifa but were stopped before even reaching shore .
the spanish government in conjunction with the european union has begun intensifying its efforts to catch illegal aliens before they enter the country .
the port city of tarifa is one of the most popular entry points .
north africa , with its population of some 80 million , is an impoverished region where the majority of people earn less than € 2,000 a year .
located just a boat ’ s ride away from europe ’ s el dorado , the maghreb has become a transit point for tens of thousands of sub-saharan africans seeking a better life in the west .
many set sail packed into make-shift boats that wash up on europe ’ s shores and have to be rescued by coast guards .
an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants enter the eu each year and their numbers are growing .
the issue of clamping down on immigration is a crucial one , especially for spain and italy , which bear the brunt of the tide .
in the previous months , eu leaders have increased their demands on north african states to do more to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving their country .
but leaders from the region , particularly libya ’ s mummar gaddafi , have said they need more financial help from the eu to alleviate poverty , which is the primary cause for migration .
the tunis declaration reflects this shared responsibility : " the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking requires joint action and cooperation .
partner in the fight on terror recognizing the link between economic development and security , the 10 leaders also stressed the need to reinforce stability in a region plagued by a decade of islamic militant violence in algeria and recently hit by suicide bombings in morocco and tunisia .
in an effort to allay worries that the eu has turned its back on the southern neighbors in its focus on integrating 10 new members from eastern europe in 2004 , chirac stressed that the eu " will not turn away from its southern bank . "
north africa is a key ally in the fight against terror .
many of those accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks and recent suicide bombings have come from north africa , where social inequalities and poverty have pushed many disenfranchised youths into the arms of radical islam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro-med talks focus on immigration and economic ties the sixth european-mediterranean conference kicked off in naples tuesday .

thousands of italians took to the streets of rome on saturday in a massive demonstration of force against government plans to drastically shake-up the state ’ s pension system . traffic jams in rome ’ s downtown are notorious , but this saturday the streets were packed with people not cars .
an estimated one million protesters took to the streets in anger over prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government plans to reform the pension system .
if passed by parliament , the reforms will require italians to pay contributions for a minimum of 40 years to receive a full pension .
that ’ s a significant change from the current 35 years now required .
" this is a big rip-off .
i think this is just the first step for the government to try to take our pensions away when we are older and in favor of private pensions , " an unnamed protester told reporters .
the march , which was organized by italy ’ s three main trade unions and endorsed by leaders of the main center-left opposition parties , brings to a head months of protests against the proposed reforms .
back in october the unions staged a four-hour strike to protest the pension reforms and have warned they will organize more strikes if the government does not change its plans .
aging population in need of reforms like germany and france , italy is struggling to overhaul its state pension system , which accounts for about 15 percent of the gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in europe .
and that proportion is likely to go up as a declining birth rate and increased life expectancy -lrb- one-fifth of the population is over age 65 -rrb- alter the demographics are place a greater burden on government coffers .
in addition to requiring italians to work longer , the berlusconi ’ s plans also offer incentives for those people who work after reaching retirement age .
currently , italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years .
unionists say the proposed reforms only benefit italy ’ s industrialists .
speaking to reporters , guglielmo epifani , head of the left-wing cgil union , said , " there is a vast majority in the working world , the nation in general , that asks for change but not policies ... that only help the few and put young people , workers , the middle-class and the elderly at a disadvantage . "
" berlusconi had better listen to the street , " said epifani , whose union is the country ’ s largest with about 5.5 million members .
the last time italians turned out in such large numbers to protest pension reform was in 1994 when berlusconi launched his last attempt to push through drastic changes and eventually brought down his seven-month-old government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.12.2003 hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes heesters was always just interested in performing .
the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .
the list included dutch-born actor johannes heesters , who turned 100 on friday . when german public television threw heesters a birthday gala and showed clips from his old movies , no one mentioned the fact that he ’ d made many of them during the third reich . but the artist , who is still revered by generations of germans for his performances in operettas and on screen , did respond to questions about why he ’ d kept silent under hitler 's regime during another tv program immediately following the gala .
“ honestly , i was too busy working , ” heesters said .
“ i couldn ’ t do anything about politics . ” the “ leni riefenstahl syndrome ” it ’ s a position common among artists whose careers took off after the nazis came to power .
like film director leni riefenstahl , whose documentaries “ triumph of the will ” and “ olympia ” helped glorify the regime , most artists denied any knowledge of hitler ’ s atrocities against the jews until after 1945 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director leni riefenstahl died last september . many people find it difficult to believe that these artists had no idea of hitler 's aims .
“ if johannes heesters says today that he was completely apolitical , i can ’ t accept that , ” says melissa müller , the author of a book on hitler ’ s list of “ divinely gifted ” artists due out in february .
the list included celebrities such as german conductors wilhelm furtwängler and herbert von karajan , actor and director gustaf gründgens and composer richard strauss . müller told dw-world that heesters was in touch with the highest-ranking members of the regime , and that his career depended on the goodwill of joseph goebbels , hitler ’ s propaganda minister .
after arriving in berlin in 1935 , heesters began appearing in movies and on stage and became a teen idol as well as one of hitler ’ s favorite stars . but “ the question is whether one can blame him for his behavior , ” said müller , who has also written a biography of anne frank and is co-author of an autobiography by hitler ’ s secretary . a generation ’ s grand delusion others see things differently .
“ riefenstahl did everything for her career , heesters had a career but kept his distance to the regime , ” says jürgen trimborn , who has written biographies on both . riefenstahl , who died in september at age 101 , was often under pressure to repent for her past .
in contrast , heesters was viewed by many as a star with a past innocent enough to keep him on a pedestal after world war ii .
“ he was a sympathetic figure and the germans wanted to have stars , ” trimborn said . it 's not just the nazi-era stars who want to forget about their past . “ basically nobody wanted to know anything about what happened before 1945 after 1945 , ” says wolfgang benz , who heads the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university .
“ it ’ s part of a generation ’ s grand delusion .
people said , ‘ we couldn ’ t do anything without risking death . ’
their children and grandchildren still believe this today . ” artists as propaganda tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the third reich 's dream couple : johannes heesters and marika rökk .
heesters has tried to demonstrate that he did resist nazi attempts to draw him in further .
he claims that he was banned from working between 1936 and 1938 after refusing to become a german citizen .
melissa müller questions this in her book , saying that he continued to make movies and appear on stage during that time . she says the roughly 1,000 “ divinely gifted ” artists were given much more freedom than ordinary germans , and adds that although they apparently didn ’ t know about their status , they were exempted from military service , paid fewer taxes and given work . while stars had to play along , they were on occasion allowed to say things that were normally punishable by death .
many in the regime looked the other way , because the artists served the nazis as propaganda tools both at home and abroad . within germany , the artists played an enormous role in maintaining a careful balance of oppression and entertainment for the masses , explains benz .
“ following propaganda-filled party conferences , there would be nothing but marika rökk for weeks , ” benz says , referring to heester ’ s hungarian co-star , who is now 90 years old . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after party conferences , nazi leaders fed soft entertainment to the masses .
to improve their image in the outside world , the nazis banked on their lenient treatment of artists “ critical ” of the regime .
“ it was much more effective than only having absolute conformists , ” müller said . visiting dachau in return , nazi leaders required artists to support troop morale by performing for soldiers and ss officers stationed at concentration camps .
in 1941 , heesters and his munich theater colleagues visited dachau concentration camp .
although it ’ s unclear whether the group actually staged an operetta there , pictures of the visit put heesters in a tough position when they first surfaced in 1978 . while downplaying the incident , the actor and singer managed to apologize for the visit in his autobiography .
“ i was ashamed of myself and i still haven ’ t stopped feeling this way , ” he wrote .
“ i am angry with myself for being gullible , credulous and naïve . ” germans have never pressed heesters on the issue and keep watching his old films such as “ always you ” and “ illusion ” -lrb- both 1941 -rrb- and the 1944 hit “ it began with such innocence . ”
his dutch countrymen , however , never forgave him for his decision to pursue a career in the land of their nazi occupiers . a dutch production of the musical “ the sound of music ” with heesters in the leading role was cancelled after one performance because of protests , according to müller .
the centenarian still dreams about returning to a dutch stage .

while several papers report on and discuss the security environment in which the attack took place , one commentary argues that the widespread availability of explosives in russia makes it too easy for militants .
and a rebel chechen website rubbishes accounts of the bombing put forward by russian officials .
according to russia 's ntv television , the attack was " the 11th act of terror in the stavropol territory in the last 18 months " .
echoing the language , moscow 's business broadsheet kommersant describes the bombing as " the biggest terrorist act this year " .
according to the paper , " it is already possible to explain why the power-wielding authorities were not ready for the new terrorist attack . "
the north caucasus railways has traditionally been a zone of higher risk rossiyskaya gazeta following bomb attacks earlier this year , the efforts of the russian interior ministry and the federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- were focused not on chechnya but on ingushetia and kabarda-balkaria " where an entire terrorist underground was discovered " , the paper says .
furthermore , it adds , the " active cleansing " of the stavropol police as part of russia 's campaign to fight police corruption nationwide led to the jailing of several senior officers ; this damaged intelligence networks in the region .
" as we know , placing hundreds of policemen on the streets is not the way to prevent terrorist acts , " the paper concludes .
but according to the government daily rossiyskaya gazeta , there was no failure in the security system .
staff of the directorate of internal affairs for transport , who are responsible for transport security , " have been carrying out their duties in a heightened state of alert for some time " , it says , adding that " the north caucasus railways has traditionally been a zone of higher risk " .
intelligence and security in the area was already stepped up , the paper says : " additional police posts were set up , the regime of checking documents and luggage was tightened and the number of police patrols were increased . "
izvestiya , the leading moscow daily , goes even further by saying that attacks were expected by the authorities .

while several papers report on and discuss the security environment in which the attack took place , one commentary argues that the widespread availability of explosives in russia makes it too easy for militants .
and a rebel chechen website rubbishes accounts of the bombing put forward by russian officials .
according to russia 's ntv television , the attack was " the 11th act of terror in the stavropol territory in the last 18 months " .
echoing the language , moscow 's business broadsheet kommersant describes the bombing as " the biggest terrorist act this year " .
according to the paper , " it is already possible to explain why the power-wielding authorities were not ready for the new terrorist attack . "

furthermore , it adds , the " active cleansing " of the stavropol police as part of russia 's campaign to fight police corruption nationwide led to the jailing of several senior officers ; this damaged intelligence networks in the region .
" as we know , placing hundreds of policemen on the streets is not the way to prevent terrorist acts , " the paper concludes .
but according to the government daily rossiyskaya gazeta , there was no failure in the security system .
staff of the directorate of internal affairs for transport , who are responsible for transport security , " have been carrying out their duties in a heightened state of alert for some time " , it says , adding that " the north caucasus railways has traditionally been a zone of higher risk " .
intelligence and security in the area was already stepped up , the paper says : " additional police posts were set up , the regime of checking documents and luggage was tightened and the number of police patrols were increased . "
izvestiya , the leading moscow daily , goes even further by saying that attacks were expected by the authorities .
" fsb officers who were working on the site of the tragedy , " the paper reports , " did not hide the fact that they had received operational information at the end of last week about terrorist acts being planned in southern russia . "
" bearing in mind that there are several terrorist groups , new attacks could take place in the next few days , " it warns .
the paper also quotes the chairman of russia 's electoral commission , aleksandr veshnyakov , as saying that it is possible the bombing was " an attempt to frighten people on the eve of -lsb- parliamentary -rsb- elections " .

" over the last 18 months over 500 firms have received such licences ... there are no rules to prevent the illegal use of explosives in russia .
" over 1,000 organisations work with explosives ; the number of people involved in such work is 55,000 ... every year 350,000 tonnes of explosive materials are transported on russian roads . "
" a kilogram of tnt costs 1,000 roubles -lrb- $ 34 -rrb- on the black market , " it says .
" the russian state is losing control of the production of explosives , " the commentary concludes on a note of warning .
the chechnya problem in a studio-based discussion on russia 's ren tv , boris nemtsov , co-chairman of the union of right forces party , argued that " the growing number of terrorist acts " proves that " the chechen problem can be resolved by negotiations only " .

most of the dead and some 200 injured in the rush-hour blast in southern russia were students going to classes .
security is being further tightened ahead of sunday 's parliamentary poll .
a minister suggested chechen rebels were behind the bombing near the town of yessentuki but chechnya 's separatist leadership in exile denied this .

president putin said the attack was an attempt to destabilise russia in the run-up to the elections .
russian justice minister yuri chaika earlier suggested evidence at the scene pointed to " chechen terrorism " as a possible theory for the blast which took place in a province which borders the war-ravaged region .
investigators believe a male suicide attacker and three female accomplices carried out the attack which ripped a packed railway carriage in two as it was travelling through the southern region of stavropol . "

" the united states strongly condemns this terrorist act and all acts of terrorism , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said in a statement .
" we stand with the russian people in their fight against terrorism , " the statement said .

rosa sandoval 's daughter maria was abducted , tortured and killed " these are the case files just for the women who have been murdered in the last few months , " she says .
" and these are just the ones who 've been killed in the capital . "
these documents tell the story of a wave of brutal and sadistic murders which is terrifying guatemala 's female population .
since 2001 , more than 700 women and young girls have been killed in apparently motiveless attacks .
so far this year more than 250 bodies have been found .
in the past six months there have been five sets of double murders , with the tortured corpses of the young girls found together .
despite making a number of arrests , police have been unable to stop the killings .
teenage gangs about four women or young girls , mostly from poor families , are being killed each week .
the connection is that they are all murdered in the same way : first they are abducted , then they are tortured , then raped , then stabbed to death and their bodies dumped .
i cry every night because i could n't do anything to save her ileana peralta the authorities suspect that vicious teenage gangs , known locally as " maras " , are responsible .
these are groups that have developed and thrived in guatemala 's impoverished slums .
ms zayas flicks through gruesome photos of some of the bodies which she has helped to recover .
one shows the decomposing face of 15-year-old girl , her eye sockets filled with maggots .
helplessness the police are facing a huge task - but have few resources .
" our police work 24 hours a day , " says ms zayas , " but they 're having to deal with about 300 cases each , which just is n't possible . "
this is little comfort for rosa elvira sandoval , whose daughter maria isabel was among those killed .
at a mass in guatemala city , her hand shakes as she lights a candle .
she has brought to the church a photograph which shows her daughter as she likes to remember her - smiling and radiant in the white dress and crown she wore when she attended her first mass .
nancy was abducted after she left work maria isabel was abducted on her way home from work .
she was later tortured , her fingernails were ripped out , and she was stabbed 47 times .
rosa learnt about her daughter 's death from the evening news .
tears streaming down her face , she sobs : " it hurts so much , to see someone you love so much , so beautiful , so happy .
to see her afterwards , to see her in a coffin , and then to see nothing .
all you have left are memories . "
maria elena and ileana peralta are still traumatised by the murder of their 30-year-old sister nancy .
she too was abducted and murdered after leaving work one evening .
" it 's so difficult , " says ileana .
" i cry every night because i could n't do anything to save her . "
it is this feeling of helplessness that links together hundreds of families .
all have lost loved ones to ferocious and senseless attacks , and all are left looking for answers that the authorities have so far been unable to provide .

here he explains why it 's so difficult to stop illicit gun trafficking around the world .
serbian-made weapons have been found in liberia a fragile peace now reigns in the west african state of liberia , where years of instability and civil war have caused widespread devastation .
this history of internal uprisings and factional fighting has created a huge demand for weapons .
and the guns frequently end up in the hands of child soldiers , some as young as 12 years old .
in an effort to bring peace and security to the country , an arms embargo was imposed in late 1992 by the united nations .
however , the embargo was regularly violated so in 2001 the security council decided to start policing it for the first time .
it appointed a panel of experts to monitor and report embargo violations to the security council sanctions committee .
liberia 's experience is not isolated ; it remains too easy for unscrupulous brokers to export weapons with false documents in march 2003 , our panel had heard rumours that a specific belgrade arms broker was preparing shipments of weapons for the liberian government in violation of un sanctions .
we wanted to build up a strong case for the authorities in belgrade to act upon and prosecute , as well as to stop any attempt by liberia to continue to buy weapons from serbian dealers .
we had tried to prosecute sanctions violators in other countries before but without success .
but this case had much promise , especially with the new post-milosevic government in belgrade .
child 's gun clue we started our investigation by looking at weapons held by deserting government soldiers and rebels from neighbouring sierra leone brought across the border into liberia .
alex vines inspects weapons in liberia and it was in no-man 's land , in the middle of the mano river union bridge between sierra leone and liberia , that i first realised we were on the right track .
a rebel child soldier showed me his ak-47 assault rifle which was stamped with m-70 2002 and a serial number .
i knew immediately that this weapon had been made in serbia .
the child told me that he had captured the weapon recently from a liberian government soldier he had killed .
from then on we found scores of serial numbers from serbian-made m-70 assault rifles , all made in 2001 and 2002 .
we also crossed into northern liberia and discovered government soldiers carrying similar weapons .
false paperwork armed with this information we travelled to belgrade to discuss our findings with the serbian authorities .
we needed to match our serial numbers with those of six shipments of weapons that were exported in 2002 from belgrade and supposedly destined for nigeria , according to the " end user certificate " .
this certificate , stating which country weapons are to be sold to , is legally required for an international arms sale to take place .
but as there is no standardised , internationally-recognised certificate , it is difficult for authorities to tell if a document is genuine or not , and so prevent an illegal deal .
in this case , the documentation was false .
the serbian officials confirmed that all our serial numbers matched the m-70 weapons exported from a serbian arms factory , even though the factory genuinely believed the guns were destined for nigeria .
we managed to prove that the serbian broker knowingly exported the weapons to liberia .
we then handed over the case to the serbian authorities to follow up and act upon .
as a result , the broker lost its export licence and has now closed down .
challenges since the making of the bbc 's film there have been serious political changes in liberia .
former president charles taylor is now in exile in nigeria and is wanted by interpol .
it is hoped un peacekeepers will bring security to liberia a un peacekeeping force has been sent to liberia following an agreement between warring factions .
there are tremendous challenges ahead : the country is awash with weapons and thousands of child soldiers need to be re-integrated into civilian life .
militias need to be disbanded and the government 's army transformed .
a serbian un peacekeeper stationed in liberia could find himself staring down the barrel of a gun made in his home country .
liberia 's experience is not isolated ; it remains too easy for unscrupulous brokers to export weapons with false documents .
a new system including standardisation of documentation , marking of weapons and a verifiable supply chain could make deals like the one from belgrade to liberia much less easy .

here he explains why it 's so difficult to stop illicit gun trafficking around the world .
serbian-made weapons have been found in liberia a fragile peace now reigns in the west african state of liberia , where years of instability and civil war have caused widespread devastation .
this history of internal uprisings and factional fighting has created a huge demand for weapons .
and the guns frequently end up in the hands of child soldiers , some as young as 12 years old .
in an effort to bring peace and security to the country , an arms embargo was imposed in late 1992 by the united nations .
however , the embargo was regularly violated so in 2001 the security council decided to start policing it for the first time .
it appointed a panel of experts to monitor and report embargo violations to the security council sanctions committee .
liberia 's experience is not isolated ; it remains too easy for unscrupulous brokers to export weapons with false documents in march 2003 , our panel had heard rumours that a specific belgrade arms broker was preparing shipments of weapons for the liberian government in violation of un sanctions .
we wanted to build up a strong case for the authorities in belgrade to act upon and prosecute , as well as to stop any attempt by liberia to continue to buy weapons from serbian dealers .
we had tried to prosecute sanctions violators in other countries before but without success .
but this case had much promise , especially with the new post-milosevic government in belgrade .
child 's gun clue we started our investigation by looking at weapons held by deserting government soldiers and rebels from neighbouring sierra leone brought across the border into liberia .
alex vines inspects weapons in liberia and it was in no-man 's land , in the middle of the mano river union bridge between sierra leone and liberia , that i first realised we were on the right track .
a rebel child soldier showed me his ak-47 assault rifle which was stamped with m-70 2002 and a serial number .
i knew immediately that this weapon had been made in serbia .
the child told me that he had captured the weapon recently from a liberian government soldier he had killed .
from then on we found scores of serial numbers from serbian-made m-70 assault rifles , all made in 2001 and 2002 .
we also crossed into northern liberia and discovered government soldiers carrying similar weapons .

the mod is in the second stage of public consultation on the proposals and held an exhibition and meeting at plymouth guildhall .
there are four firms bidding for the work to remove the reactors , and three of them are proposing dismantling the submarines at devonport .
eleven submarines have already been decommissioned but remain with their reactors intact floating in the docks at rosyth in fife and at devonport , the uk 's only nuclear-licensed dockyards .
but space is running out and there are 16 more submarines coming to the end of their working lives .
people at plymouth guildhall give their views on submarine dismantling at-a-glance a number of proposals , including shipping the reactors to the dounreay nuclear plant in scotland , are also being considered as part of the consultation .
the dismantling work could create about 100 jobs , says the mod .
but ian avent , of the plymouth-based campaign against nuclear storage and radiation -lrb- cansar -rrb- , said many more jobs could be lost in tourism if the plans went ahead as people stayed away .
he said : " there is always a risk of an accident because you are using things like thermic lances and burning torches to cut the submarine up .
" if you had a fire in a reactor compartment , you could have the equivalent of a ' dirty bomb ' . "
devonport in spotlight what do you think about sub dismantling at devonport ?
the mod say the reactors are defuelled before removal and the radioactivity involved is tiny .
project manager brian hooper , of the ministry of defence , said : " there is more nuclear material in a nuclear refit than there is in cutting up one of these submarines .
" and the bids which we are considering for devonport do not involve storing the reactors at devonport .
" all of the bids at present are for taking the waste away from devonport . "
dr jane hunt , from lancaster university , is leading the public consultation team .
she said : " people are concerned about cancer rates and that the proposals are commercially driven and whether waste can be managed in the middle of a large city .
" people in plymouth are saying take it somewhere remote like scotland whereas people in scotland are saying leave it in plymouth . "
she added : " one of the arguments that has been raised elsewhere is that plymouth has had the benefit of the employment , so plymouth should bear the burden of the waste .
" but clearly people in plymouth do not feel like that . "

the mod is in the second stage of public consultation on the proposals and held an exhibition and meeting at plymouth guildhall .
there are four firms bidding for the work to remove the reactors , and three of them are proposing dismantling the submarines at devonport .
eleven submarines have already been decommissioned but remain with their reactors intact floating in the docks at rosyth in fife and at devonport , the uk 's only nuclear-licensed dockyards .
but space is running out and there are 16 more submarines coming to the end of their working lives .
people at plymouth guildhall give their views on submarine dismantling at-a-glance a number of proposals , including shipping the reactors to the dounreay nuclear plant in scotland , are also being considered as part of the consultation .
the dismantling work could create about 100 jobs , says the mod .
but ian avent , of the plymouth-based campaign against nuclear storage and radiation -lrb- cansar -rrb- , said many more jobs could be lost in tourism if the plans went ahead as people stayed away .
he said : " there is always a risk of an accident because you are using things like thermic lances and burning torches to cut the submarine up .
" if you had a fire in a reactor compartment , you could have the equivalent of a ' dirty bomb ' . "
devonport in spotlight what do you think about sub dismantling at devonport ?
the mod say the reactors are defuelled before removal and the radioactivity involved is tiny .
project manager brian hooper , of the ministry of defence , said : " there is more nuclear material in a nuclear refit than there is in cutting up one of these submarines .
" and the bids which we are considering for devonport do not involve storing the reactors at devonport .
" all of the bids at present are for taking the waste away from devonport . "
dr jane hunt , from lancaster university , is leading the public consultation team .
she said : " people are concerned about cancer rates and that the proposals are commercially driven and whether waste can be managed in the middle of a large city .
" people in plymouth are saying take it somewhere remote like scotland whereas people in scotland are saying leave it in plymouth . "
she added : " one of the arguments that has been raised elsewhere is that plymouth has had the benefit of the employment , so plymouth should bear the burden of the waste .
" but clearly people in plymouth do not feel like that . "

the mod is in the second stage of public consultation on the proposals and held an exhibition and meeting at plymouth guildhall .
there are four firms bidding for the work to remove the reactors , and three of them are proposing dismantling the submarines at devonport .
eleven submarines have already been decommissioned but remain with their reactors intact floating in the docks at rosyth in fife and at devonport , the uk 's only nuclear-licensed dockyards .
but space is running out and there are 16 more submarines coming to the end of their working lives .
people at plymouth guildhall give their views on submarine dismantling at-a-glance a number of proposals , including shipping the reactors to the dounreay nuclear plant in scotland , are also being considered as part of the consultation .
the dismantling work could create about 100 jobs , says the mod .
but ian avent , of the plymouth-based campaign against nuclear storage and radiation -lrb- cansar -rrb- , said many more jobs could be lost in tourism if the plans went ahead as people stayed away .
he said : " there is always a risk of an accident because you are using things like thermic lances and burning torches to cut the submarine up .
" if you had a fire in a reactor compartment , you could have the equivalent of a ' dirty bomb ' . "
devonport in spotlight what do you think about sub dismantling at devonport ?
the mod say the reactors are defuelled before removal and the radioactivity involved is tiny .
project manager brian hooper , of the ministry of defence , said : " there is more nuclear material in a nuclear refit than there is in cutting up one of these submarines .
" and the bids which we are considering for devonport do not involve storing the reactors at devonport .
" all of the bids at present are for taking the waste away from devonport . "
dr jane hunt , from lancaster university , is leading the public consultation team .
she said : " people are concerned about cancer rates and that the proposals are commercially driven and whether waste can be managed in the middle of a large city .
" people in plymouth are saying take it somewhere remote like scotland whereas people in scotland are saying leave it in plymouth . "
she added : " one of the arguments that has been raised elsewhere is that plymouth has had the benefit of the employment , so plymouth should bear the burden of the waste .
" but clearly people in plymouth do not feel like that . "
public consultation is continuing , with a decision expected in 2007 .
