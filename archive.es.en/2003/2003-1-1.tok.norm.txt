migrants also tried to break out of the villawood camp , police said , in the latest of a series of violent incidents to hit the country 's centres for asylum seekers .
security is being increased at the camps in australia and at a centre on christmas island , where detainees had an angry stand-off with guards .
the fires have caused damage estimated at millions of dollars refugee advocates say the trouble stems from desperation among migrants , who may be held for years while their claims for asylum are processed .
prime minister john howard has said the protests will not alter his government 's policies .
there have been protests and fires at the woomera and baxter detention centres in south australia , port hedland in western australia , as well as christmas island and now villawood .
immigration officials said about 20 mainly chinese migrants broke windows at the villawood camp to steal keys to a staff car .
some then tried to use the car to ram their way through perimeter gates but were blocked by a police vehicle .
criminal investigation elsewhere in the camp , other detainees set buildings on fire causing damage estimated at about us $ 270,000 , officials said .
" this was criminal damage of the worst kind - a rampage intended to cause destruction with no regard for the safety of the other detainees housed at villawood , " an immigration spokesman said .
fires caused serious damage at baxter at the weekend he said security had been stepped up at all detention centres in australia and federal police were investigating the blazes with a view to laying criminal charges .
the refugee council of australia believes a fear of indefinite detention is the main factor behind the disturbances .
the bbc 's phil mercer in sydney says the processing of asylum claims usually takes a few months , but it is not uncommon for some detainees to be held for up to three years while awaiting a final decision .
mr howard acknowledged the unrest but said his government would not be deterred from detaining illegal immigrants or from diverting boats carrying mainly afghan and middle eastern asylum seekers to pacific islands .
both policies have been criticised by human rights groups and the united nations .

on the other hand , there is less agreement about what lies behind the policy .
the structure of washington 's global strategy has a pleasing logic to it .
but there are dangers the official reason for military action , if it becomes necessary , is to get rid of weapons of mass destruction .
but washington 's approach to iraq illuminates something much broader - the global strategy of the bush administration .
its most obvious manifestation has been president bush 's war on terrorism , jolted into life by the galvanic shock of the 11 september attacks .
that became the first strand of washington 's grand strategy , as analysed recently in the diplomatic monthly of the french newspaper , le monde .
unconvincing threat the war on terror was then extended - many would say unconvincingly - to iraq and other states in the rogues ' gallery which might supply weapons of mass destruction to terrorists .
the us is committed to " regime change " in iraq the bush administration has had a hard job convincing its allies that the weakened iraqi regime poses a substantial , imminent threat to other countries .
it is commonly said that the us ' real aim in wishing to remove saddam hussein is to get control of iraq 's huge oil reserves .
however important this motive is in the minds of those around mr bush , it can certainly be argued that the second strand in their global strategy is to secure greater supplies of foreign oil .
an energy report by vice-president dick cheney 18 months ago forecast that american oil imports would have to rise by more than half by 2020 - partly , of course , because the administration is not much interested in reducing consumption .
energy needs the report recommended increasing imports from the gulf , but also diversifying sources of supply to the caspian sea basin , latin america and sub-saharan africa .
this effort is now a reality .
missile defence looks set to become a keystone us policy mr bush 's officials , for example , are on record as saying that african oil is of strategic national interest to the united states .
securing foreign oil and fighting the war on terror require many instruments , including the unrelenting use of american political influence and commercial weight .
but the most obvious tool is the military one .
and the heart of the third strand of washington 's strategy is to transform the american armed forces and ensure military pre-eminence for the united states into the far future .
missile defence is supposed to make americans invulnerable at home , while mobile forces equipped with hi-tech weapons project power across the world .
that has become all the more important because of the emphasis on acting before potential threats become actual - a key argument for going to war against iraq .
guiding principles in the bush military doctrine , pre-emptive action has been elevated to a cardinal principle .
the three strands of the global strategy intertwine .
the us is flexing its military muscles to take one example , american military bases set up to fight al-qaeda in central asia may also serve to safeguard oil supplies , to back up the commercial exploitation of the caspian basin .
then there is the military training the americans are giving to the georgian armed forces - to help them fight terrorists , yes , but it is not coincidental that a new oil pipeline is planned through georgia .
the structure of washington 's global strategy has a pleasing logic to it .
but there are dangers .
the george bush who before 11 september used to call for less military involvement abroad now sets no limit on such operations .
where is the exit strategy ? - as his secretary of state , colin powell , used to say .
complex military operations in unstable regions could simply provoke more disorder and anti-american violence .
muslim backlash they could , as is often argued , simply increase the pool of recruits for al-qaeda .
invading iraq might in the long term make middle east oil supplies less , not more , secure .
a war against iraq is likely to foment muslim anger there are those in and on the fringes of the bush administration who have even more far-reaching ambitions .
some hardliners favour going beyond toppling saddam hussein to remove two other governments accused of supporting terrorists - in syria and iran .
one motive for this scheme would be to eliminate any possible remaining threat to israel .
but a more high-minded ambition inspires some - that the united states should remake the whole middle east in its own democratic image .
those who see the policy in these terms have been labelled democratic imperialists - or fantasists by their opponents .
after all , european attempts to redraw the map of the middle east in the 20th century were pretty disastrous .
george w bush himself , it should be said , has in practice been cautious up to now .
but the picture of iraqis dancing in the streets as the americans liberate baghdad is a beguiling one .
that might indeed be the first reaction .
but would it last ?
do the visionaries in washington really believe that a democratic saudi arabia would love america more ?

the number of people going to attractions which used to charge rose from less than eight million in 2001 to more than 13 million in 2002 - a rise of 70 % records show .
the most startling increases were at london 's main museums , but museums in other major cities have also fared well . "
no longer is income an obstacle to enjoying the riches of our cultural heritage " culture secretary tessa jowell visitor numbers doubled at london 's victoria and albert and the science museum - and are up by more than 80 % at the natural history museum .
outside the capital , the success has been repeated .
museum attendances have on average increased by more than half - with admissions to manchester 's museum for science and industry up by two thirds .
in leeds 24 % more people went through the doors of the royal armouries collections while in portsmouth visitor numbers at fort nelson rose by 54 % .
culture secretary tessa jowell welcomed the figures .
" no longer is income an obstacle to enjoying the riches of our cultural heritage , " she said .
first time or regulars ?
what the figures do not reveal , however , is whether the huge rise is down to people going to a museum or gallery for the first time or whether traditional visitors were just going more often .
it was also unclear from the report whether free admission was attracting people who would not normally consider going to museums or galleries .
mark jones , director of the v & a is convinced that scrapping fees has attracted a wider group of people .
" these are the highest figures in the v & a 's history , with more than two million visitors , and show that free entry has been a resounding success .
" more people are visiting the v & a for the first time and more people are making return visits to enjoy our collections and exhibitions , " he said .
free entry to museums was a policy initiative promised by labour when it came to power in 1997 .
but it took several years to come to fruition with museums concerned about losing out financially , although they were keen to open their doors free to the public .
chancellor gordon brown eased these concerns by introducing tax changes in the 2001 budget .
many museums and galleries still charge entrance fees for their exhibitions .

the number of people going to attractions which used to charge rose from less than eight million in 2001 to more than 13 million in 2002 - a rise of 70 % records show .
the most startling increases were at london 's main museums , but museums in other major cities have also fared well .
no longer is income an obstacle to enjoying the riches of our cultural heritage culture secretary tessa jowell visitor numbers doubled at london 's victoria and albert and the science museum - and are up by more than 80 % at the natural history museum .
outside the capital , the success has been repeated .
museum attendances have on average increased by more than half - with admissions to manchester 's museum for science and industry up by two thirds .
in leeds 24 % more people went through the doors of the royal armouries collections while in portsmouth visitor numbers at fort nelson rose by 54 % .
culture secretary tessa jowell welcomed the figures .
" no longer is income an obstacle to enjoying the riches of our cultural heritage , " she said .
first time or regulars ?
what the figures do not reveal , however , is whether the huge rise is down to people going to a museum or gallery for the first time or whether traditional visitors were just going more often .
it was also unclear from the report whether free admission was attracting people who would not normally consider going to museums or galleries .
mark jones , director of the v & a is convinced that scrapping fees has attracted a wider group of people .
" these are the highest figures in the v & a 's history , with more than two million visitors , and show that free entry has been a resounding success .
" more people are visiting the v & a for the first time and more people are making return visits to enjoy our collections and exhibitions , " he said .
free entry to museums was a policy initiative promised by labour when it came to power in 1997 .
but it took several years to come to fruition with museums concerned about losing out financially , although they were keen to open their doors free to the public .
chancellor gordon brown eased these concerns by introducing tax changes in the 2001 budget .
many museums and galleries still charge entrance fees for their exhibitions . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's razia iqbal " the government says it is committed to the free admission policy " freeing the museums see also : 01 may 02 -pipe- entertainment visitors flock to free museums 01 dec 01 -pipe- entertainment museums ' no longer special treats ' 30 nov 01 -pipe- entertainment behind the museum doors 08 nov 01 -pipe- entertainment museums turn on government 01 may 01 -pipe- entertainment museums set dates for free entry 07 mar 01 -pipe- budget 2001 museums and galleries will be free internet links : victoria & albert museum natural history museum imperial war museum department for culture , media and sport the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top entertainment stories now : fans await beatles ' jam ' footage afghans repair broken heritage mona lisa smile secrets revealed gallery unveils titian show spice girls dismiss comeback plan hello ! executive denies ' court plot ' star wars strikes $ 15m tv deal tv 's joe millionaire picks his lady links to more entertainment stories are at the foot of the page .

there is conflicting evidence over whether some types of cancer might be linked to the contaminated vaccine .
batches of polio vaccine tainted with " simian virus 40 " -lrb- sv40 -rrb- were given between 1955 and 1963 .
this was because monkey kidney cells were used in the jab 's production process .
traces of the monkey virus have been found in some human tumours , raising the possibility that it could play a role in the disease .
however , this has not been supported by the majority of epidemiological data .
us cancer incidence data have not shown an increased incidence of pleural mesothelioma among the birth cohorts that were exposed to sv 40-contaminated poliovaccine us research team the latest research , published in the journal of the national cancer institute , looked at a rare cancer of the membrane that covers the lungs known as pleural mesothelioma .
there was a rise in cases of this cancer between the mid 1970s and the late 1990s , and the sv40 virus has been detected in some biopsy samples .
a us team looked at the incidence of the cancer in men and women of different age groups and compared it with trends in exposure to the tainted vaccine .
howard strickler and colleagues of the albert einstein college of medicine in new york found no clear link .
conflicting reports the group most prone to pleural mesothelioma - men aged 75 or over - was least likely to have received the vaccine .
furthermore , the cancer was rare in women even though they were just as likely to have been exposed to the contaminated poliovaccine as men .
genetic traces of the virus have been found in tumours among those most heavily exposed to the early vaccine - men aged 25 to 54 - incidence rates of the cancer remained stable or decreased .
the authors say that after almost 40 years of follow-up , " us cancer incidence data have not shown an increased incidence of pleural mesothelioma among the birth cohorts that were exposed to sv40-contaminated poliovaccine " .
they add , however , that continued surveillance of all people exposed to the vaccine is needed " in view of conflicting reports on the detection of sv40 genomic dna sequences in mesothelioma tumour samples " .
aids controversy the us study did not look at other types of cancer linked with the monkey virus such as non-hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system .
previous research has found genetic " footprints " of the virus in 43 % of the non-hodgkin 's tumour cells .
there is no proof that sv40 causes the human cancer , although animal experiments suggest this can happen .
in addition , it is not proven that the polio vaccine was the source of the sv40 .
some patients born long after the contaminated batches were given have tested positive for the virus , yet scientists are unsure whether it is communicable between humans .
it has also been alleged that the virus which causes aids was passed from primates to humans in contaminated batches of poliovaccine , although close examination of frozen samples of 1950s stock appear to suggest otherwise .

the good news is that 2003 looks set to be another exciting year in film , with some hugely anticipated blockbuster sequels , high-quality oscar favourites and new films from the likes of steven spielberg , spike lee , martin scorsese and the coen brothers .
in fact scorsese 's latest , gangs of new york , is one of the first big films of the new year , released on 10 january .
the film focuses on the conflicts between italian and irish immigrants in the big apple in the mid-19th century , which ultimately led to the formation of the mafia , and has been a long-time coming .
con artist scorsese first had the idea for the film in 1978 and planned to make it in 1981 , but it was shelved after the historical epic heaven 's gate became one of the biggest flops of all time and studios became wary of tackling similar projects .
gangs of new york has already been tipped for oscar success , notably for daniel day-lewis who came out of retirement to star in the film .
it also sees leonardo dicaprio back on screen for the first time since he starred in the beach in 2000 .
dicaprio also features in the latest film from steven spielberg , catch me if you can , which opens on 31 january .
based on a true story , it sees him playing charismatic con artist frank abagnale jr , who made millions in the 1960s by posing as an airline pilot , a top surgeon and a lawyer despite still being in high school and having no formal training in any of the above .
tom hanks co-stars as an fbi agent hot on his trail .
stellar cast another film attracting a lot of attention is the hours , uk director stephen daldry 's follow-up to billy elliot .
due for release in february , it is based on the novel by michael cunningham and centres on three women living in different eras whose lives are profoundly affected by the works of virginia woolf .
the stellar cast has julianne moore as a housewife compulsively reading mrs dalloway in 1949 while preparing a party , meryl streep as a modern-day woman throwing a party for an aids-stricken friend -lrb- ed harris -rrb- , and nicole kidman as virginia woolf herself , looking unrecognisable under make-up .
of course , speculation as to what will be in the running come oscar time is rife .
gangs of new york and the hours are early front-runners , as is chicago , the screen version of the hit musical , starring catherine zeta-jones , renee zellweger and richard gere .
other contenders include far from heaven , a 50s-set drama which is almost certain to land its star julianne moore a best actress nomination , spielberg 's catch me if you can and roman polanski 's holocaust drama the pianist .
denzel washington , who won best actor oscar in 2002 , could do well with his directorial debut antwone fisher , as could adaptation , spike jonze 's offbeat follow-up to being john malkovich , in which nicolas cage plays screenwriter charlie kaufman -lrb- who , just to confuse matters , actually did write the screenplay -rrb- .
blockbuster sequels in the acting categories , expect the casts of the hours -lrb- meryl streep , julianne moore , nicole kidman -rrb- and chicago to register , along with michael caine for the quiet american and oscar perennial jack nicholson for his turn as a world-weary retired businessman in about schmidt .
and on the directing front , scorsese could be in line for his first ever oscar for gangs of new york .
naturally 2003 will bring its share of blockbuster sequels to screens , with the likes of x-men 2 , terminator 3 : rise of the machines , charlie 's angels 2 and tomb raider 2 all due in cinemas before the end of the year .
but perhaps the most highly anticipated of the pack is the matrix reloaded , which is set for release in may 2003 .
it has been almost four years since this ground-breaking film series made its debut .
but the wait will be worth it as two sequels are due to be released in the same year .
keanu reeves returns as the rebel leader neo , along with cast members carrie-anne moss , laurence fishburne and hugo weaving and newcomers monica bellucci and jada pinkett smith .
a second sequel , the matrix revolutions , which was filmed at the same time , is also on the way next year , and is currently due for release in november .
golddigger 's plot for those seeking respite from the blockbusters , there is always the latest film from the coen brothers .
intolerable cruelty , once tipped as a reunion project for pretty woman stars richard gere and julia roberts .
the film , about a golddigger 's plot to marry a rich lawyer and bag his millions in a divorce settlement , instead features catherine zeta-jones along with coen regulars george clooney and billy bob thornton .
and in a year when seemingly every big hollywood director has something to offer , let 's not forget quentin tarantino .
he has not done a film since jackie brown in 1997 , which makes the arrival of his latest project , kill bill , all the more exciting .
the film was shot in china in 2002 , and stars uma thurman as an assassin who is gunned down at her wedding -lrb- along with the rest of her guests -rrb- and emerges from a coma five years later hungry for revenge .
it is reportedly heavily inspired by martial arts films , so expect some terrific kung-fu fighting and lots of violence , all bound together with tarantino 's trademark wit .
it is expected to hit screens in october .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- us backs diplomacy against n korea bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point wednesday , 1 january , 2003 , 09:49 gmt us backs diplomacy against n korea united states president george w bush says america is involved in a diplomatic showdown with north korea , not a military one .
taking time out from a new year break at his texas ranch , mr bush said he believed the dispute over pyongyang 's decision to restart its nuclear programme could be resolved peacefully .
crisis chronology 16 oct : n korea acknowledges secret nuclear programme , us announces 14 nov : fuel shipments to n korea halted 12 dec : n korea threatens to reactivate yongbyon plant 22 dec : n korea removes monitoring devices at yongbyon reactor 26 dec : un says 1,000 fuel rods have been moved to the plant 27 dec : n korea says it will expel un nuclear inspectors 31 dec : inspectors leave north korea 31 dec : n korea threatens to nuclear npt withdrawal south korea is also pinning its hopes on diplomacy and deputy foreign minister lee tae-shik has arrived in beijing , seeking support from china - a traditional ally of pyongyang .
north korea said on tuesday it had no choice but to reopen its reactors , because the us was planning a pre-emptive strike against them .
pak ui-chun , pyongyang 's ambassador to moscow , was quoted by russian news agencies as saying the us had followed moves to cut off fuel oil supplies to the energy-starved state by " threatening us with a preventative nuclear strike " .
" in these circumstances , we also can not fulfil the non-proliferation treaty , " he added .
correspondents say this is the clearest indication yet that the secretive state may pull out of the key nuclear non-proliferation pact , which it signed in 1985 .
' diplomacy a better tactic ' " one of my new year 's resolutions is to work to deal with these situations in a way that they 're resolved peacefully , " mr bush said of the growing crises in iraq and north korea . "
all options , of course , are always on the table " us president george w bush asked why he was prepared to go to war with iraq , which may not have nuclear weapons , but not against north korea which does have them , mr bush said diplomacy was the better tactic to adopt with pyongyang .
" i view the north korean situation as one that can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy , " he said , while adding that " all options , of course , are always on the table . "
the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says south korea is trying to get support from russia and china , both of which are seen to have some influence over north korea .
he says it is hoped that pyongyang 's old allies will play a more active role in trying to persuade north korea to halt its nuclear programme again .
seoul is planning to send an envoy to moscow later .
in the latest signal of difficult relations between the us and south korea , thousands of protesters in seoul saw in the new year with another mass rally against the us military presence there .
inspectors out the last united nations nuclear inspectors left the country on tuesday morning after pyongyang ordered them out last week .
an international atomic energy agency spokeswoman said the agency regretted the expulsion , but hoped to return to north korea .
pyongyang ordered the inspectors to leave amid an escalating stand-off over its plans to revive a mothballed nuclear complex at yongbyon , 90 kilometres -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- north of pyongyang .
inspectors had been stationed at yongbyon for the past eight years , monitoring nuclear activities at the complex - which experts say is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
