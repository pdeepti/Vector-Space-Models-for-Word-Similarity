estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .
-lrb- sept .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .
the church of fear “ congregation ” seems to be growing .
the group says chapters have been started in nicaragua , britain and namibia .
and the future may have cof gospel choirs in store .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .
" if we want something of the developing countries - and we should - then we should put an end to the protection we continue to claim in agriculture and the textile industry .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .
the church of fear “ congregation ” seems to be growing .
the group says chapters have been started in nicaragua , britain and namibia .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .
-lrb- sept .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .
-lrb- sept .
9 , 2003 -rrb- ten new countries to join european union along with estonia , nine other countries have satisfied enough european union criteria to be seriously considered for membership .

others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .

developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .
" if we want something of the developing countries - and we should - then we should put an end to the protection we continue to claim in agriculture and the textile industry .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .
“ one could critically say to the swedes you have to do whatever the central bank decides , but you aren ’ t allowed to be part of the decision making process . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedes stick to the krona swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency .
-lrb- september 15 , 2003 -rrb- swedish pm blames big economies for euro weakness prime minister persson of sweden says europe 's biggest economies are responsible for the weakness of the eurozone .
that 's not likely to convince his skeptical compatriots to vote for the euro in an upcoming referendum .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2003 putting the brakes on budget airlines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of no-frills airlines want to take away the tax breaks they enjoy .
german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2003 pillars of society - tree-sitting performance art in frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first church of fear pole-sitters appeared in venice at the biennale art exhibition in june .
the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .
the church of fear “ congregation ” seems to be growing .
the group says chapters have been started in nicaragua , britain and namibia .
and the future may have cof gospel choirs in store .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .
the church of fear “ congregation ” seems to be growing .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .

with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .

with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .
" if we want something of the developing countries - and we should - then we should put an end to the protection we continue to claim in agriculture and the textile industry .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.09.2003 swedish ' nej ' to euro bolsters euroskeptics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members from the left party and the green party celebrate in stockholm after sunday 's vote .
sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .
“ one could critically say to the swedes you have to do whatever the central bank decides , but you aren ’ t allowed to be part of the decision making process . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedes stick to the krona swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .

cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2003 putting the brakes on budget airlines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of no-frills airlines want to take away the tax breaks they enjoy .
german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .

maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .
church of fear , described on its website as an international association of sects and religious communities , is schilingensief ’ s latest vehicle .
the well-known german gadfly loves to take aim at politicians and major corporations as well as cultural issues .
cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .
our beliefs are destroyed .
that 's why church of fear says fight the terror monopoly of politics … sabotage the media machinery that produces fear … our beliefs have been taken from us , our fear will not be ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .
schlingensief was apparently preparing for his staging of the opera " parsifal " at the bayreuth wagner festival in 2004 .
" win with your loser " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn is one of seven candidates in the third international pole-sitting competition in frankfurt .
then , after overcoming initial difficulties recruiting seven appropriate people to be “ pillar saints , ” occupants the tree trunks in frankfurt , the third pole-sitting contest was kicked off on monday with the theme " win with your loser . "
cof has said spectators will be able to follow the competition on its website and can place bets on who they think will win .
the church of fear “ congregation ” seems to be growing .
the group says chapters have been started in nicaragua , britain and namibia .
and the future may have cof gospel choirs in store .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2003 putting the brakes on budget airlines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of no-frills airlines want to take away the tax breaks they enjoy .
german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .

" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .

developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .

the church of fear , a project by german gadfly christoph schlingensief , has reached germany and it 's hard to know what to make of it .
maybe that 's the point . from monday until saturday , people strolling along frankfurt pedestrian zone in the city ’ s center will be treated to a group of people perched on top of tree trunks .
it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .

schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .
-lrb- sept .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .

it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .

cof seems to take aim at them all , religion , the government , media and modern society .
the website somewhat cryptically proclaims : " we are made to fear .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theater director christoph schlingensief the pole-sitting series got its start at this year 's venice biennale in june , where berlin-based director schlingensief positioned a group of motionless people wearing cof t-shirts on pillars at the entrance to the country pavilions at one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions .
schlingensief and the cof then moved on to kathmandu , nepal in late july , where they arranged another pole-sitting contest , this time with seven people from five different religious communities and a five-day , 191 km -lrb- 119 mile -rrb- procession from the city of pokhara to kathmandu .
while in venice pole-sitters only had to sit through the day , - but in 40 degree celsius -lrb- 104 degree fahrenheit -rrb- temperature heat - the seven participants in kathmandu spent night and day atop their tree trunks .
" here the seven now avow their beliefs - the remainders of belief , lack of belief , " schlingensief explained .
" eat terror " the director 's journal entries published in the berliner morgenpost newspaper during a nine-day pilgrimage from cologne to frankfurt -lrb- main -rrb- added make it easier to understand what church of fear is about .
schlingensief wrote enigmatic comments about the highlights of the " moving corpus " procession , such as being blessed by a cologne pastor , a foot injury he incurred walking through germany and his comments to a " red-capped arab " in a u.s. " snack bar " -lrb- " do n't eat bread , eat terror . " -rrb- .
the pilgrimage ended with a " last supper " in a former tram depot with an altar , incense , candles , a dining table laid out for more than 40 participants and music from composer richard wagner .

estonians voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining the european union in a referendum sunday with results showing the “ yes ” camp grabbing 63 percent of the vote . after sunday 's historic vote on whether or not the ex-soviet state should break with its cherished independence and join the 15-nation european union next year , estonians woke up on monday to find themselves suddenly feeling very european .
with 63 percent of the population voting in favor of membership in the new bloc and 37 percent against it , the country overwhelmingly decided to embrace europe as its future .
" europe , here we are ! " the country 's biggest daily sl ohtuleht splashed across its front page .
one of the smallest and economically strongest candidate countries slated to join the bloc on may 1 , 2004 , estonia emphatically repudiated fears the country ’ s dynamic and liberal economy would get mired in eu red tape if it joined the union .
" a ' yes ' in today 's vote will finalize a process that started 15 years ago - our aspiration to join europe in economic , political and cultural terms , " economy minister meelis atonen told reuters , referring to the freedom movement of the late 1980s .
estonia is the second to last of eight eastern european countries to hold an eu referendum to join the bloc when it expands from 15 members to 25 next may .
it 's neighbor latvia goes to the polls in five days .
complete revamp estonia went through a complete change when the soviet union collapsed and it gained independence in 1991 .
the communist designed planned economy became a thing of the past and the smallest of the three baltic states quickly developed into a free market economy and a modern democracy .
economic growth is around 6 percent , inflation at just 3 percent and unemployment has been brought down to around 9 percent , proving that the country 's economic policies pave the way for a successive entry into the eu .
economy the main argument in eu vote both supporters and opponents of eu membership employed economic arguments to back up their positions .
proponents believed eu membership would fuel further growth and create new jobs , but critics believed it could slow the country 's climb considering the recent economic troubles in larger eu countries like germany and france .
just as in latvia and lithuania , eu opponents contended the country should n't go from one union , the soviet union , into the european union .
does size matter ?
many estonians fear their small country of 1.4 million inhabitants will disappear in the vast eu , which will have close to 500 million inhabitants after the expansion is concluded next year .
only cyprus , malta and luxembourg are smaller .
but others , like estonian prime minister juhan parts , believe eu membership is crucial to the small country 's future .
" joining the eu will finalize estonia 's incorporation into europe and will help us secure continuity of the estonian state and democracy , " parts told the news agency reuters ahead of the vote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships .

sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .

that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .
“ one could critically say to the swedes you have to do whatever the central bank decides , but you aren ’ t allowed to be part of the decision making process . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swedes stick to the krona swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.09.2003 swedish ' nej ' to euro bolsters euroskeptics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members from the left party and the green party celebrate in stockholm after sunday 's vote .
sweden ’ s resounding rejection of the euro is likely to have important repercussions for the european union .
whereas swedish business may now suffer , euroskeptics elsewhere in europe have seen their hand strengthened . sweden , with its long tradition of neutrality , has always had a conflicted relationship with the european union .
despite strong support from the government , the press and business leaders , swedes overwhelmingly voted against joining the euro on sunday . amid high turnout following the tragic murder of swedish foreign minister anna lindh last week , over 56 percent of swedes chose to keep their currency the krona .
only 42 percent were in favor of becoming part of the euro zone .
while stockholm may now have to face declining influence in the eu , the decision could also have an impact on events far beyond the borders of the scandinavian nation of eight million . as to be expected , euroskeptics in denmark and britain – the two other current eu members besides sweden not participating in the euro – were immediately hearted by the result . “ this is proof there is a europe where one doesn ’ t have to be a part of economic and currency union , ” danish euro opponent and socialist party leader holger nielsen told the afp news agency . britain vote less likely euroskeptics in britain were also bolstered by the swedish ‘ nej ’ to the euro , saying on monday british prime minister tony blair could no longer argue the country would be isolated within the eu if it chose to keep the pound .
whereas denmark rejected joining the 12 nation euro bloc in a referendum three years ago , blair had hoped to lead britain into the euro zone by holding a similar vote before the next general election . but with the british public still against ditching the pound by nearly 2 to 1 , the swedish rejection of the euro is likely to make an already cautious blair even more reluctant to risk his political future over the issue . perhaps fearing the swedish vote could reverse momentum for the single currency project , european commission president romano prodi said sweden would “ certainly ” lose influence in the eu by staying outside the euro zone . whereas the 10 nations , mostly from eastern europe , that are set to join the eu next may are slated to join the euro whenever the economic conditions allow , brussels is now faced with the possibility that the three rich nations currently outside of the euro zone will remain so indefinitely .
that could delay or perhaps even scuttle the euro entry of already eu skeptical countries like poland . sweden faces " worse opportunities " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goeran persson swedish prime minister goran persson , who led the failed pro-euro campaign , said the country would remain an active participant in europe , but also admitted “ in the long term we will have worse opportunities than we would otherwise have had . ” besides the risk that foreign investors will now choose to avoid sweden in favor of setting up shop in neighboring euro zone countries , swedish firms like telecom equipment maker ericsson or utilities company vattenfall may now consider moving operations abroad to save costs . “ people still seem to believe that we live in a europe with national borders and national currency , but the reality is something else , ” said alf svensson , leader of sweden ’ s opposition christian democrats and a euro supporter , according to the associated press . many swedes feared that giving up monetary policy to the european central bank could endanger the country ’ s generous welfare system and being locked in to a one-size-fits-all interest rate with growth laggards germany and france would hurt the economy .
but with such close ties to the euro zone , some argue the central banks of countries like sweden have little choice but to follow the lead of the ecb . “ this thing with the euro is rather strange , ” wolfgang roth , vice president of the european investment bank , told deutschland radio on monday .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .
government spokesman béla anda did insist that there are currently no plans for introducing new taxes on airlines .
he said the ticket prices should be set by the laws of supply and demand and not imposed by government fiat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are budget airlines killing the planet ?
they 're cheap , easy and disastrous for the environment , according to german environmentalists .
no-frills airlines are under attack in a new awareness-raising campaign .

it is the latest performance art project from one of germany 's most famous agents provocateur , theater director christoph schlingensief , and his church of fear -lrb- cof -rrb- .
the seven volunteers perched two and a half meters in the air are described by cof as " jobless , homeless or hopeless . "
they were recruited to compete in its " third international pole-sitting contest , " where they are meant to " demonstrate their fears . "
the person who manages to remain on top of a pole the longest will win € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,250 -rrb- .

german politicians who focus on environmental issues have accused the popular no-frills airlines of dumping prices to attract passengers , all to the detriment of the environment .
they want ticket prices to go up . the environmental spokesman for the green party , winfried hermann , called the rock-bottom prices of the low-cost airlines a “ scandal ” for the environment , since they have drawn passengers from less polluting modes of transportation to airplanes .
he is in favor of introducing take-off and landing fees as well as “ noise control ” fees of up to € 5 per ticket , saying they would reflect the “ economic and ecological costs ” associated with no-frills airlines .
the parliamentarian also demanded the states and municipalities put an end to the practice of offering subsidies to regional airports which become hubs for low-cost carriers such as deutsche ba , easyjet , ryanair , and hapag-lloyd express , among others .
hermann has been joined by politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who say the low-cost airlines , which offer tickets across germany for as low as € 20 -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , enjoy an unfair advantage over other forms of transportation , such as rail travel , since they are exempt from vat and fuel taxes and can charge significantly lower prices .
“ this price dumping must come to an end as soon as possible , ” hermann scheer , member of the spd party executive , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
“ the goal should be that flights within germany are at least as expensive as the corresponding train trip . ”
a traveller flying from berlin to the city of cologne in western germany can , with some advance planning , get a one-way ticket on hapag-lloyd express , a no-frills airlines for € 19.95 .
the same trip by train would cost approximately € 80.40 .
anti-no-frills campaign the debate over the benefits and disadvantages of low-cost carriers comes just a week after several environmental groups in germany introduced a campaign warning of the environmental damage resulting from increasing air traffic .
hahn airport , hub to many of germany ’ s budget carriers , saw a million passengers pass though its gates last year , an 81 percent increase over the year before .
hapag-lloyd has estimated that between 5 and 6 million passengers fly no-frills every year .
environmental groups say such air travel is a climate catastrophe in the making , since airplanes emit three times the amount of greenhouse gases that automobiles do .
the no-frills travel boom , according to germany ’ s green lobby , is the country ’ s “ climate killer # 1 . ”
no-frills carriers bite back the low-cost carriers have come out against any new regulations that would force them to raise their prices and reject accusations of price dumping , saying tickets are priced according to the rules of market competition .
“ it would be nice if german rail would do the same , ” matthias andreesen , spokesperson of the low-cost carrier deutsche ba , told reporters .
herbert euler of hapag-lloyd express defended the low prices as good for consumers and made possible through the pared-down business model that is the norm among the no-frills airlines . “ if politicians demand society become ever more mobile , then they have to allow this inexpensive form of transport that is good for consumers and good for the economy , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
while the criticism of the no-frills flyers is coming from spd and green politicians , chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet has kept quiet on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2003 wto talks collapse in cancun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a black day for the wto : the second failure of talks in four years disappointment reigned among the world 's richer countries after world trade organization talks in cancun collapsed .
but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .
but jubilation among developing countries , may soon be tempered by bleak predictions from analysts . poor countries will suffer most from the failure to cut tariffs and open markets , the head of the organization for economic cooperation and development 's trade directorate , jean-maire metzger , told reuters news agency .
developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .
" if we want something of the developing countries - and we should - then we should put an end to the protection we continue to claim in agriculture and the textile industry .

but delegates from poorer countries celebrated their ability to block proposals from the eu and others . the world trade organization conference of trade ministers , which came to an end on sunday , was meant to dismantle barriers to global trade and further the doha round of trade talks begun in the qatar city two years ago and scheduled to be completed in late 2004 .
but from the very start of the five days of talks between the 146 wto member states , the meeting was dogged by the issue of farm subsidies .
the negotiations in the mexican resort town cancun were dealt the final blow when african and asian countries refused new measures to cut red tape on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grim faces from german minister wolfgang clement and renate künast in cancun after wto talks collapsed .
" in cancun , buzzwords prevailed over reason , " commented german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , interviewed by german broadcaster zdf on monday .
clement said an important chance to open markets had been wasted .
european trade commissioner pascal lamy was equally grim : " i would not say the doha round -lsb- of trade talks -rsb- is dead , but it is certainly in intensive care . "
and german agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast lamented : " those who now celebrate , celebrate on the backs of the weakest . " but some poorer countries boasted they had been successful in blocking u.s. and eu ambitions .
" -lsb- we are -rsb- elated our voices have now been heard , " philippine trade secretary manuel roxas said .
the president of the united federation of sugar producers in the philippines , manuel lamata , said it was impossible for the third world to compete with subsidized developed countries .
" it is about time the first world countries realize they can not just step on the poor countries , " he said . indeed , subsidies were one of the main stumbling blocks in the talks .
a 21-nation coalition of developing countries led by brazil , china , india and south africa had aimed to convince the united states and the european union , in particular , to slash farming subsidies that they said unfairly forced their farmers to compete against the world 's richest countries .
the talks on subsidies , which made no progress , bogged down the entire conference . moves by the eu , japan and south korea to curry agreement on the so-called singapore topics - foreign investment , competition , customs facilitation and government procurement - were shot down by poorer countries , who insisted that farm subsidies were the most pressing issue . pyrrhic victory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protest against the wto during the inauguration ceremony meeting in cancun .

developing countries would earn more than twice as much as they receive every year in official development aid from trade liberalization , he said .
" this is a pyrrhic victory for those who claim victory . " but in an interview with deutsche welle , the chief economist at deutsche bank , norbert walter , was critical of the richer countries refusal to give way on farm subsides .

swedish voters came out strong against the euro on sunday .
despite a last-minute boost to the " yes " camp after the murder of anna lindh , official results showed 56 percent were opposed to introducing the common currency . marked by shock and mourning for the loss of popular foreign minister anna lindh , sunday 's emotional referendum on the adoption of the euro in sweden turned in favor of the country 's strong eurosceptic camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna lindh despite a last-minute boost for the pro-euro camp in the aftermath of the shock murder of lindh who was a strong advocate of the common currency , the naysayers were in the clear majority .
with official results showing 56 percent against the euro and only 42 percent in favor , the swedes said " nej " to entering the euro zone and joined the ranks of denmark and britain as the third european union member to maintain its national currency .
a defeat for persson sunday 's outcome represents a defeat for prime minister goran persson , who like anna lindh campaigned hard for the adoption of the euro . supported by major political parties and big business , persson tried in vain to convince the country ’ s nine million citizens , the euro would boost trade and bring in stronger growth .
sweden ’ s eurosceptic camp was leading in opinion polls since april , but the sudden tragic death of foreign minister and leading pro-euro campaigner anna lindh just three days before the vote had raised hopes the " yes " side could benefit from an outpouring of sympathy votes .
swedes strongly wary of euro many swedes have been skeptical towards the euro since the swedish economy has performed better than those of euro zone heavyweights germany and france .
both countries also continue to flout eu rules on budget deficits that are supposed to secure the euro , increasing fears that such infringements could harm other euro zone members ' economies .
others in sweden feared joining the euro could mean stockholm would lose control over the country ’ s generous welfare system , as control over monetary policy is ceded to the european central bank in frankfurt .
despite their clear victory , celebrations among the eurosceptic winners were muted in light of the grief and mourning for anna lindh .
lindh 's killer still at large the 46-year-old mother of two , who was tipped as a future prime minister , died on wednesday after being stabbed repeatedly by an assailant in an upscale department store in stockholm .
on saturday , sweden ’ s tabloids published a series of photographs of the suspected killer , gleaned from the video footage .
the killer was shown wearing a blue baseball cap and a gray sweatshirt , his face obscured .
though police have no concrete information on the killer ’ s identity they contend that the attack was carried out by a person , acting alone and on impulse .
they believe he probably comes from the violent drug scene in stockholm .
" this is not the act of a novice criminal .
the killer has done this kind of thing before – you don ’ t begin your criminal career with this kind of crime , " an official told news agency afp .
swedish media said on saturday the police had focused their search on a pool of five to ten suspects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden mourns loss of a beloved leader swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday .

but i take no pleasure in the failure of the wto to resurrect the so-called doha development round .
a deal at cancun that reflected the concerns of developing countries could have lifted millions of people out of poverty .
the world bank estimated that 144 million people in the third world would benefit from the new round of trade talks .
a fair deal for the poor would have had to involve the eu and us accepting some painful concessions .
their system of supporting their farmers with $ 300bn per year is a scandal .
farm subsidies lead to dumping of cheap goods on third world markets , destroying the livelihoods of poor farmers .
blame game but failure at cancun has dashed prospects of farm reform .
the wto and the multi-lateral trading system it represents are now in crisis .
the blame game has already begun , and the eu must bear a large burden of the guilt .
the eu 's insistence on pushing the wto members to start negotiations on the " new issues " of investment , competition , government procurement , and trade facilitation effectively caused the talks to break up .
the " new issues " are all very obscure - and that is the point .
that a deal on agriculture was sacrificed for them is hard to accept , as they were always a diversion from the real issue .
over 100 countries had categorically stated that they did not even want to talk about the new issues until a deal on agriculture had been struck .
when that did not happen in cancun , the talks hit a brick wall .
bleak outlook so what next ?
the possibility of progress back at wto headquarters in geneva looks bleak .
and with the rich countries turning more and more to bilateral deals , developing countries will be in even weaker positions to get fair trade rules .
the wto must not be allowed to fade into irrelevance .
developed and developing countries a like face a huge task in rescuing the wto from impending doom .
that will depend on the wto members coming up with fair trade rules - ones that enable poor countries to develop while allowing the global economy to flourish .

llanelly house in llanelli , west wales , was voted into the finals of the six-week series by viewers and stood to win millions of pounds to bring it back to its former glory .
but on sunday , viewers voted to give the £ 3.4first prize to manchester 's victoria baths .
the decision has come as a major blow to people from the town , who had been rallying support for their building to be chosen in the unique bbc2 series .
deputy mayor of llanelli nigel bevan was among a coachload of 50 supporters who travelled to london for the final .
" we 've been looking at restoring it for the past two years .
it would need £ 3m to bring it back to its former glory . "
the final is taking part at the tower of london and mr bevan 's party of supporters travelling there include town councillors , members of the local historic society and others working on the restoration of the house .
in the ninth programme of the 10-part series which featured three welsh buildings , presenter griff rhys-jones called on viewers to choose between llanelly house and two other buildings in wales - vaynol old hall in gwynedd and amlwch port and parys mountain in anglesey .
llanelly house was at the cutting edge of architectural design when it was built in 1714 and an impressive status symbol of power and wealth for the tiny fishing town .
commissioned by the town 's leading family - the stepneys - the house has been sadly neglected and is now in a dilapidated condition with its glories boarded up .
a nationwide vote decided which building should be given a new lease of life with money raised throughout the course of the series .
jennifer stewart , heritage lottery fund manager for wales had been hopeful it would do well .
" the restoration of llanelly house , one of the finest early georgian townhouses , will be an exciting project not only to restore the building but to find it a long-term use which has meaning for the area , " she said .
phone votes during the show 's five-week run have generated cash to enable restoration .
a further £ 3m from the heritage lottery fund will also help to secure the winner 's future .
' conservation concerns ' griff rhys-jones said : " restoration has been a huge success .
it 's put conservation concerns on the agenda and i hope entertained a lot of people on the way . "
carole souter , director of the heritage lottery fund , added : " the way these 10 fantastic buildings have caught the public 's imagination demonstrates just how passionate people really are about their heritage .

but the latest survey from property website rightmove found asking prices for uk properties growing at an annual rate of just 9.1 % , with prices falling 0.6 % in august compared with the previous month .
limitations the data for the new government index is collated by the office of the deputy prime minister .
the major drawback is that the new reading is not very timely - it will only appear two months in arrears in search of the perfect index it said the move to produce the figures on a monthly basis followed calls from the bank of england and the treasury for an official monthly house price index to help their forecasting .
while other market surveys are based on prices agreed when mortgages are advanced , the government 's version covers actual prices when the transactions are completed .
but limitations in the data on which it is based means it will only monitor about a quarter of the uk 's mortgage-funded deals each month - and will not include properties bought for cash .
the new index shows that annual house price inflation rose to 14.6 % in july from 13.4 % in june .
average house prices england £ 166,669 scotland £ 93,778 wales £ 103,669 northern ireland £ 100,246 source : office of the deputy prime minister but there were big regional differences across the uk , with annual house price inflation highest in the north east of england at 24.4 % and lowest in london at 9.4 % .
but when it came to average house prices the situation was reversed , with the highest average price being £ 241,818 in london and the lowest £ 96,620 in the north east .
first-time buyers paid an average price of £ 120,830 in july , up from £ 114,699 the month before .
opinion split the rightmove survey found average asking prices fell by 0.6 % in the month to 6 september , the first monthly decline since january and the sharpest since the beginning of 2002 .
the fall dragged the annual rate of house price inflation from 12.4 % the previous month to 9.1 % , the first time it has dipped below the symbolic 10 % level since the rightmove index was launched a year ago .
rightmove 's figures are at odds with recent surveys from mortgage lenders halifax and nationwide , which both calculated that house prices rose by slightly more than 1 % in august .
halifax and nationwide results also differ from rightmove 's in that their latest estimates of annual house price inflation are far higher at 19.2 % and 16.6 % respectively , although they agree that the rate of increase is slowing .
during july , the halifax estimated prices were growing at an annual rate of 19.2 % while the nationwide 's survey showed a 17.9 % increase - both higher than the new government estimate .

the waverly route trust said that other european countries had successfully experimented with raising funds from the communities which will benefit from the railway .
the dream of reopening 35miles -lrb- 56km -rrb- of railway between edinburgh to tweedbank near galashiels has moved closer towards reality with the publication of the waverley railway bill .

according to the waverley railway project , the benefits of reopening the line include access to jobs in edinburgh , extra local employment and more investment in housing .
a tight timetable has been worked out for building the railway but the problem of how it will be paid for is the biggest obstacle .
now the waverley route trust has said a study should be made of alternative means of finance .
it said community railway lines in germany , austria , sweden and ireland have shown freight and tourism interests - as well as commuters - can be asked to contribute to the costs .
studies have predicted that the rail development would lead to £ 130m of housing investment in the borders and midlothian .
the proposed route includes plans for new stations at shawfair , eskbank , newtongrange , gorebridge and galashiels .

the league against cruel sports wants to end what it calls a " disgusting abuse of one of ireland 's native species " .
the organisation will repeat the success of its previous save our stags campaign , after deer hunting was declared illegal in northern ireland .
chief executive of the league douglas batchelor will outline the campaign in northern ireland to politicians and scientists .
mr batchelor will detail the league 's plans and how it will begin a public campaign for the removal of the irish hare from the quarry list and the granting of statutory protection in forthcoming legislation .
also speaking at monday 's conference will be alliance leader david ford who led a cross-party campaign in the northern ireland assembly two years ago to secure extra protection for the irish hare .
hunting ban a representative of the environment and heritage service will also be present , together with irish hare campaigner mike randle and trevor long , chairman of youth link northern ireland .
the league against cruel sports has campaigned in england , scotland and wales for a total ban on hunting with dogs , since it was formed in 1924 .
last month , a bill to ban hunting with dogs cleared the house of commons , with the tories failing to win compensation for those who may lose their livelihoods .
mps had voted for the activity to be banned after the government was forced to abandon a compromise plan which would have allowed fox hunting to continue under licence .
the call for compensation came during a debate on the remaining stages of the hunting bill .
but mps gave the bill , which makes no provision for compensation , a third reading by 317 votes to 145 .
the result sets up another bruising battle with the house of lords , which has opposed a hunting ban since labour was elected with a pledge to allow a free vote on fox hunting in 1997 .
the government has already said that hunting with dogs could be outlawed for good within two years .

the 20,000 square kilometre forest delta stretches across the lower reaches of the bengal basin - 60 % falling in bangladesh and the rest in the indian state of west bengal .
satellite imagery shows that the sea level in the sundarbans has risen at an average rate of 3.14 centimetres a year over the past two decades - much higher than the global average of two millimetres a year .
scientists believe that in the next 50 years , a rise of even one metre in sea level would inundate 1,000 sq.km of the sundarbans .
" the sundarbans appears to be a lost cause , " says professor sugato hazra , director of the school of oceanographic studies at calcutta 's jadavpur university , which runs a project in the indian sundarbans .
sinking fast in the past two decades , four islands - bedford , lohachara , kabasgadi and suparibhanga - have sunk into the sea and 6,000 families have been made homeless .
two other islands - ghoramara and mousuni - are fast going under .
sagar , the biggest island in the sundarbans , has already lost 30 sq.km.
by 2020 , it will have lost another 15 % of its habitable area , displacing more than 30,000 people , says professor hazra .
his study of satellite pictures reveals a worrying rate of coastal erosion in the indian sundarbans .
" the entire island system is faced with a rapid loss of land area and embankments , flooding and salinisation of drinking water , " says professor hazra .
" many residents are moving out ; these islands are becoming uninhabitable , " says utpal mukherjee , additional district magistrate of south 24-parganas district , under which the indian sundarbans falls . "
we will go looking for land elsewhere but many of us will become landless labourers " jagabandhu das , fisherman " it is a matter of time before the two islands of ghoramara and mousuni are swallowed up by the sea .
we can only provide relief to the people .
we can not fight nature . "
however , on sagar , the district administration has tried to do just that .
it has constructed huge embankments to ring the coastal inlands .
but during high tides , the embankments are damaged .
some develop cracks and collapse .
taking shelter every winter , sagar hosts the great hindu festival , the gangasagar mela .
tens of thousands of devotees pray at the temple of the great sage , kapil muni .
the original temple was devoured by the sea during british rule .
a new one had to be built several kilometres inland , but now the sea is closing in on that as well .
at lot-8 , the nearest land port to ghoramara or sagar , scores of families are taking shelter from the islands .
" we will go looking for land elsewhere but many of us will become landless labourers , " says jagabandhu das , a fisherman from ghoramara .
a total of 54 of the 102 islands in the indian sundarbans are still habitable .
but they also face other pressures .
about 2,500 sq.km have been set aside as a tiger reserve since 1973 but poaching of the royal bengal tiger continues , aided by corrupt forest officials .
tree-felling during the past century has more than halved the mangrove cover in the indian section as successive administrations allowed rampant land reclamation for human settlement .
since the first settlements in 1770 , the population of the indian sundarbans has risen 200 % to nearly 4.3 million .
the population has put pressure on the ecosystem , which acts as a nursery for the aquatic resources of the bay of bengal .
professor hazra says mangrove depletion will increase the threat of flooding upstream in calcutta .
" it is an ecological disaster in the making , " he says .
vital matters west bengal 's minister for sundarbans development , kanti ganguly , admits that the situation is serious .
under a directive from federal authorities , his government formed the coastal regulatory zone authority in 1999 , specifically for the sundarbans .
but the body did not meet for two years - and did little after that .
the authorities need to address a range of vital matters .
the move towards a prawn monoculture - the cultivation of a single species that can lead to its extinction erosion caused by the barraging of rivers and diversion or blocking of upstream water the use of mangrove wood to feed a gas plant in the gosaba and choto mollakhali islands .
-lrb- the west bengal renewable energy development agency has vowed to investigate the allegations and , if proven , halt the practice -rrb- the silting of west bengal 's largest port , haldia , because only three of seven walls to divert the hooghly river have been built by the port trust of india .
in the sundarbans , the rising sea level and soil erosion threaten to submerge large swathes of land , making thousands more homeless .
the diverse marine life - river sharks , red crabs , shrimps , snakes - all uniquely adapted to the saline water - will be harmed , drastically affecting the food chain and fishing industry .
scientists say that the sundarbans , south asia 's largest " carbon sink " - which mops up carbon dioxide - must survive to help prevent global warming .
but will it ?

the population has put pressure on the ecosystem , which acts as a nursery for the aquatic resources of the bay of bengal .
professor hazra says mangrove depletion will increase the threat of flooding upstream in calcutta .
" it is an ecological disaster in the making , " he says .
vital matters west bengal 's minister for sundarbans development , kanti ganguly , admits that the situation is serious .
under a directive from federal authorities , his government formed the coastal regulatory zone authority in 1999 , specifically for the sundarbans .
but the body did not meet for two years - and did little after that .
the authorities need to address a range of vital matters .
the move towards a prawn monoculture - the cultivation of a single species that can lead to its extinction erosion caused by the barraging of rivers and diversion or blocking of upstream water the use of mangrove wood to feed a gas plant in the gosaba and choto mollakhali islands .
-lrb- the west bengal renewable energy development agency has vowed to investigate the allegations and , if proven , halt the practice -rrb- the silting of west bengal 's largest port , haldia , because only three of seven walls to divert the hooghly river have been built by the port trust of india .
in the sundarbans , the rising sea level and soil erosion threaten to submerge large swathes of land , making thousands more homeless .
the diverse marine life - river sharks , red crabs , shrimps , snakes - all uniquely adapted to the saline water - will be harmed , drastically affecting the food chain and fishing industry .
scientists say that the sundarbans , south asia 's largest " carbon sink " - which mops up carbon dioxide - must survive to help prevent global warming .
but will it ?

recent us growth figures have been encouraging , but unemployment remains stubbornly high and consumer sentiment - a key indicator in a country where consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity - is shaky .
" if you get further data showing some kind of growth revival ... it means that people are reinforced in their expectations of what equity markets can deliver in the coming years , " said nigel richardson , an equity strategist at axa investment management .
preliminary clues as to the strength of the us recovery will come on monday , when official estimates of us industrial production and capacity utilisation in august are released .
rate intentions investors will also be poring over the minutes of the september meeting of the bank of england 's rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- , due out on wednesday .
here , they will be searching for any signs of an increase in support for raising interest rates among the committee 's members .
all nine mpc members voted to keep rates on hold at 3.5 % in august , but some of them may have shifted in favour of a rise in the light of subsequent data showing stronger than expected expansion in the services sector .
any significant increase in support for raising rates will tend to reinforce forecasts by some city analysts that borrowing costs could start to rise as soon as the end of this year .
also on tuesday , the markets will be watching out for uk inflation figures for august , revised japanese industrial production data for july , and a closely-watched gauge of german economic prospects compiled by the zew institute .
the uk 's annual rate of underlying inflation is expected to come in unchanged from july at 2.9 % , while investors will be hoping for upbeat japanese data following tentative signs the country is emerging from a protracted downturn .
last week , official data showed that the japanese economy grew by a better than expected 1 % in the three months to june , helped by strong exports .

investors need more reassurance the benchmark ftse 100 share index closed lower for the fourth consecutive session on friday , settling down 0.46 % at 4,237.8 .
" we have had a good run in the third quarter due to hopes of a cyclical recovery , " said jeremy batstone , head of investment strategy at the fyshe group .
" but we now need further confirmation of that recovery . "
in corporate news , the week will be dominated by retailers , with the uk 's biggest supermarket group , tesco , due to report first-half results on tuesday , and smaller rival morrison to follow suit on thursday .
analysts expect both companies to turn in solid growth in profits and sales , helped by warm summer weather .
key news events this week us interest-rate decision -lrb- tues -rrb- uk inflation -lrb- tues -rrb- tesco results -lrb- tues -rrb- bank of england minutes -lrb- weds -rrb- kingfisher results -lrb- weds -rrb- next results -lrb- thurs -rrb- morrison supermarkets results -lrb- thurs -rrb- city forecasters have pencilled in a 15 % rise in pre-tax profits to £ 625m for tesco , while press reports over the weekend suggested that morrison could report pre-tax profits of £ 130m , also up by 15 % from this time last year .
both sets of results are likely to be overshadowed by renewed speculation over the outcome of the safeway takeover battle .
the two firms are among four supermarket groups waiting to hear from competition authorities whether they will be allowed to bid for safeway , which put itself up for sale in january this year .
other retailers due to report this week include diy specialist kingfisher and high street clothing chain next .
us rebound ?
in a busy week for economic news , investors will be focusing in particular on the us federal reserve 's interest rate decision for september , to be announced on tuesday .
if you get further data showing some kind of growth revival ... it means that people are reinforced in their expectations of what equity markets can deliver in the coming years nigel richardson axa investment management the fed is expected to leave rates on hold at 1 % , but the markets will be scrutinising its accompanying statement for clues as to how the us central bank sees the economy evolving in the months ahead .
recent us growth figures have been encouraging , but unemployment remains stubbornly high and consumer sentiment - a key indicator in a country where consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity - is shaky .
" if you get further data showing some kind of growth revival ... it means that people are reinforced in their expectations of what equity markets can deliver in the coming years , " said nigel richardson , an equity strategist at axa investment management .
preliminary clues as to the strength of the us recovery will come on monday , when official estimates of us industrial production and capacity utilisation in august are released .
rate intentions investors will also be poring over the minutes of the september meeting of the bank of england 's rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- , due out on wednesday .
here , they will be searching for any signs of an increase in support for raising interest rates among the committee 's members .
all nine mpc members voted to keep rates on hold at 3.5 % in august , but some of them may have shifted in favour of a rise in the light of subsequent data showing stronger than expected expansion in the services sector .
any significant increase in support for raising rates will tend to reinforce forecasts by some city analysts that borrowing costs could start to rise as soon as the end of this year .
also on tuesday , the markets will be watching out for uk inflation figures for august , revised japanese industrial production data for july , and a closely-watched gauge of german economic prospects compiled by the zew institute .
the uk 's annual rate of underlying inflation is expected to come in unchanged from july at 2.9 % , while investors will be hoping for upbeat japanese data following tentative signs the country is emerging from a protracted downturn .
last week , official data showed that the japanese economy grew by a better than expected 1 % in the three months to june , helped by strong exports .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : why did trade talks collapse ?

the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in cancun , mexico - aimed at liberalising trade between rich and poor countries - has ended without agreement .
bbc news online explains why no deal was reached , and how it will affect people north and south .
why did the talks fail ?
the talks failed because rich and poor countries could not reach agreement on two key issues .
the first and most contentious of these was agriculture .
rich countries were accused of hypocrisy for urging poor countries to open their markets but not being prepared to open their own - or reduce the huge subsidies to their farmers .
in the end , the rich countries would not agree to the abolition of all export subsidies which make their agricultural products cheaper on world markets .
there was also a great deal of opposition to european union proposals for rules to govern investment by multinational companies in the developing world .
many countries felt that they could not agree to this without losing control of their industries , and argued that the wto was not the appropriate forum for such discussions .
who is to blame ?
both sides have blamed each other for the failure of the talks .
the us trade representative in cancun said poor countries would have to be prepared to compromise more if future trade talks were to make progress .
but developing countries blamed the eu , for trying to introduce a far too ambitious agenda on issues such as investment and competition .
in reality , it was the developing countries ' ability to maintain a common bargaining position despite pressure from the rich , and despite differing interests on some issues , that proved decisive .
it showed that the developing nations now have real power in the wto .
what happens next ?
this was only an interim meeting in the doha round of trade talks .
now the negotiations return to the back rooms of geneva , hopefully out of the headlines , where trade officials will make suggestions on the way forward .
but there are real doubts whether the ambitious deadline of concluding the doha round by the end of next year can be met .
the cancun setback makes it unlikely that a deal can be completed by 2005 .
however , earlier trade rounds also suffered from delay - including the previous uruguay round which lasted eight years .
it all depends on whether the shock of failure at cancun will make both sides more willing to compromise at the next ministerial meeting , which will take place in hong kong in 2004 .
who will be affected by the failure ?
trade has been the engine of world economic growth over the past 50 years .
but in the past few years there has been a sharp slowdown .
a new trade deal would have boosted economic growth and confidence .
developing countries will be the biggest loser if trade liberalisation fails , however .
the world bank estimates that 144 million people would be lifted out of poverty if a deal had gone through in cancun .
citizens in rich countries would have gained from a deal involving agriculture through cheaper food prices .
however , developing countries are still on track to make gains in two areas .
under an earlier agreement , rich countries have agreed to full opening up of textile and clothing markets by the end of 2004 .
and in august , there was a deal that should make cheap medicines available to poor countries in the near future .
the wto has agreed to finalise the deal on importing generic drugs to meet medical emergencies like hiv / aids within the next six months .
