the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .

" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .
blair to meet aznar as well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with jose maria aznar at an earlier meeting in london .
after talks with chirac , blair is expected to welcome spanish prime minister jose maria aznar for a brief meeting .
iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .
spain has stationed 1,250 troops in iraq .
blair and aznar , however , are expected to discuss the touchy issue of gibraltar .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .

iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .
on tuesday the proposal will be put to a formal vote by all the 15 current eu ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible compromise in eu deficits row eu finance ministers began meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 bank merger calls meet resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would like to see fewer names on the towers in frankfurt 's banking district .
press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .
blair to meet aznar as well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with jose maria aznar at an earlier meeting in london .
after talks with chirac , blair is expected to welcome spanish prime minister jose maria aznar for a brief meeting .
iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .
spain has stationed 1,250 troops in iraq .
blair and aznar , however , are expected to discuss the touchy issue of gibraltar .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .

nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .

chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .
" it 's very boring and expensive to defend it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chef reaches for stars in france claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .
back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 euro zone ministers break stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes is worried about violating budget rules .
finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .

" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .
on tuesday the proposal will be put to a formal vote by all the 15 current eu ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible compromise in eu deficits row eu finance ministers began meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .

in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west bank barrier , anti-semitism cloud israeli leaders ' european visit israeli prime minister ariel sharon is in europe at a time of acute tension between the two sides .

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .

" last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .

with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 germans split on future of stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still smiling : eu monetary commissioner solbes and german finance minister eichel germans praised and criticized the decision by eu finance ministers to give germany more time to fix its budget .
the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .

in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .

" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .

the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .
" it 's very boring and expensive to defend it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chef reaches for stars in france claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .

he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .
" it 's very boring and expensive to defend it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chef reaches for stars in france claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 taking aim at alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers quickly develop a taste for alcopops , sweet fruit juice mixed with vodka , rum and whisky the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .
in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .

but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .
" it 's very boring and expensive to defend it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chef reaches for stars in france claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .

almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .

the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .

the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .

almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .

spain has stationed 1,250 troops in iraq .
blair and aznar , however , are expected to discuss the touchy issue of gibraltar .

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .

" while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .

back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 bank merger calls meet resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would like to see fewer names on the towers in frankfurt 's banking district .
press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

" it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .

for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .
" it 's very boring and expensive to defend it . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chef reaches for stars in france claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 bank merger calls meet resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would like to see fewer names on the towers in frankfurt 's banking district .
press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .
blair to meet aznar as well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with jose maria aznar at an earlier meeting in london .
after talks with chirac , blair is expected to welcome spanish prime minister jose maria aznar for a brief meeting .
iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .
blair to meet aznar as well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with jose maria aznar at an earlier meeting in london .
after talks with chirac , blair is expected to welcome spanish prime minister jose maria aznar for a brief meeting .
iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .
spain has stationed 1,250 troops in iraq .

a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .
others have followed suit more recently . " it 's very exciting to win a michelin star , " said marco pierre white , who rebuffed michelin when it awarded him three stars for two of his london restaurants .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .
on tuesday the proposal will be put to a formal vote by all the 15 current eu ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible compromise in eu deficits row eu finance ministers began meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 taking aim at alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers quickly develop a taste for alcopops , sweet fruit juice mixed with vodka , rum and whisky the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .
in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .

" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .

he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "

praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .

the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 israel slams european anti-semitism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariel sharon levels sharp criticism at europe israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism . "
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "

in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .

for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .

" last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

the annual report showed the number of drug related deaths in germany had decreased .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

as of monday , germany 's top chefs are either sobbing in their boulliabaisse or feeling as light as a soufflé .
the michelin guide germany 2004 , with its star-studded restaurant ratings , has been released . over the past year , teams of undercover operatives have been sneaking into top restaurants under assumed names , ordering escargot and goose liver , breton oysters and duck à l 'orange , scrutinizing the sauces and handing down verdicts on the vichyssoise .
now the hammer has fallen ; culinary judgment has been made .
like a beaujolais nouveau , the michelin guide for germany has arrived . stars have been given , and stars have been taken away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's " im schiffchen " restaurant has three stars .
michelin 's 2004 version of its famous restaurant guide for germany was published on monday .
the " red guides , " widely considered the bibles of the culinary connoisseur , determine for many who resides in the upper echelons of the gastronomic universe by awarding top restaurants one , two , or a rare constellation of three stars . this year , michelin 's germany guide elevated 23 restaurants into its ranks , but decided that 18 star holders were no longer worthy of their designations and stripped them of the coveted status .
all in all in germany , there are 175 restaurants in the one-star category while 13 have two stars .
only five restaurants in germany enjoy michelin 's highest honor . hamburg is the leader among german cities with michelin-star restaurants .
nine restaurants in the city have earned stars .
berlin comes in second with eight , followed by stuttgart with seven . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , head chef of the " schwarzwaldstube " restaurant in baiersbronn-tonbach , which has three michelin stars a michelin blessing can be a powerful springboard to gastromonic stardom .
chefs with stars under their belts demand salaries between € 6,000 and € 10,000 -lrb- ca . $ 7,100 - $ 11,800 -rrb- a month and are held in high esteem by their colleagues . at the same time , a loss of a star - restaurants must constantly defend their rankings - can send chefs and their careers plummeting .
hans-peter wodarz , 57 , a chef who once cooked the wiesbaden restaurant " ente vom lehel " into the michelin heaven , told the newsmagazine der spiegel that the guide can either " advance livelihoods or destroy them . " taster in the house ! such power is not looked upon lightly and when a restaurant suspects that one of the michelin emissaries has come to rate the establishment , the atmosphere in the kitchen can get tense .
that is what happened recently at the two-star restaurant " zur alten post " in bad neuenahr-ahrweiler . a 30-year-old guest who had arrived at midday , alone , raised suspicions .
he did n't order any appetizers and drank only one glass of wine . " from what we chefs know , those are clear indicators that a michelin tester is sitting there at the table , " hans stefan steinheuer , head chef at the restaurant , told der spiegel . steinheuer even went out to the parking lot behind the restaurant and found a car there with michelin tires and a license plate indicating it came from karlsruhe , where michelin 's german headquarters is located . despite the uproar , he denies that he would treat a suspected michelin tester any differently than he would an ordinary guest .
still , the knowledge that a michelin judging might be taking place , which can have ramifications not only for fame and glory , but also for profits and salaries , can be tough on the nerves , he said . top chef wodarz told der spiegel that the fear of losing a star once it 's earned " can be equivalent to the fear of castration . " the price of stardom for some though , michelin stars can turn into black holes , eating up profits and energies trying to meet the demands of the secret and some consider suspect judging methods . " i was losing money , lots of money , " matthias dahlinger , the 34-year-old chef of the eichhalde restaurant in freiburg , told bloomberg .
" that 's why i told michelin to take back my star . " dahlinger said defending the michelin tribute was costing him a fortune , because he did n't have enough customers to pay the higher prices the rating brought along with it .
after six years of having a star on the door of his family-run restaurant , he decided to take it off . " last year i invested $ 16,000 in 250 expensive french wines to maintain my star , " he said .
" i could n't meet my payroll .
michelin 's expectations are too high . " he decided to cut his prices and reduce expenses by offering less expensive wines and replacing items like caviar .
he decided the star was not worth catering to the whims of a shrinking market of wealthy tourists who arrange their itineraries around following michelin 's milky way . he 's not alone in his rejection of the famed rating .
the renowned parisian brasserie maxim 's asked michelin to take back its stars in the 1980s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 taking aim at alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers quickly develop a taste for alcopops , sweet fruit juice mixed with vodka , rum and whisky the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .
in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .
on tuesday the proposal will be put to a formal vote by all the 15 current eu ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible compromise in eu deficits row eu finance ministers began meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .

topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .

finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit . after more than 10 hours of tough negotiations , euro zone finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday broke free from the constraints of the eu budget rules by deciding to forego formal sanctions against germany and france for violating the deficit limits of the stability and growth pact for a third year running .
despite hefty criticism from the european commission , the majority of the 12 members agreed on a compromise solution that calls for no more than a political commitment to cutting deficits in the coming year .
in addition , berlin and paris have been given until 2005 to reign in their budget deficits below the euro zone ’ s limit of three percent gdp .
the rate of cuts is less than demanded by eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes who warned that the ministers were entering uncharted territory and it would now be harder to enforce budget discipline rules in the future .
" the commission deeply regrets that these proposals are not following the spirit and the rules of the -lrb- eu -rrb- treaty and the stability and growth pact , " the eu executive said tuesday morning .
the three percent deficit limit is the crux of the stability and growth pact which was established before the creation of the monetary union and is designed to underpin the value of the euro .
proponents of strict eu budgetary discipline say the pact is the key to ensuring a strong and stable common currency and reject any plans to water it down .
criticism for special treatment italian finance minister giulio tremonti , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said the compromise was in line with the spirit and letter of eu budget rules .
but spain , the netherlands , finland and austria rejected the special treatment for europe ’ s two largest economies , and the commission has vowed to fight the proposal .
" the commission , while continuing to apply the treaty , will reserve the right to examine the implication of these conclusions , if they are finally accepted , and decide on possible subsequent actions , " solbes said .
eu diplomats opposing the new deal have said european central bank chief jean-claude trichet is on their side .
the ecb president is a vocal critic of watering down eu budget guidelines and has urged euro zone finance ministers to vote for enforcing the stability pact rules .
on tuesday the proposal will be put to a formal vote by all the 15 current eu ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible compromise in eu deficits row eu finance ministers began meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .

" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .

the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "

it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 germans split on future of stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still smiling : eu monetary commissioner solbes and german finance minister eichel germans praised and criticized the decision by eu finance ministers to give germany more time to fix its budget .
the government hailed it as a way to spur job growth , the opposition called it a " black day for europe . " in the wee hours of tuesday morning , hans eichel finally got his way .
finance ministers of the 12-member euro zone voted to hold off on sanctions against germany for violating the stability and growth pact for a third year in a row next year .
only eichel 's austrian , finnish , dutch and spanish colleagues had voted against a reprieve , thereby following a proposal by the european commission .
that body , especially eu monetary commissioner pedro solbes , wanted to force germany to slash at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- from the budget to bring its deficit in line with pact regulations .
the stability and growth pact , which was established to maintain a stable euro across the monetary union , requires member countries to keep their deficit below three percent of gross domestic product .
a success for job growth , a black day for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guaranteeing the stability of the euro is what the pact is all about .
in exchange for not pressing for penalties , the german finance minister assured the euro zone ministers that he will reach the three-percent goal by 2005 .
despite getting away with little more than a political commttment , eichel described the compromise as " very demanding for germany . "
back at home , members of the ruling social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties were more jubilant than that .
" this is a success for job growth , " said spd parliamentarian and finance expert joachim poß , reiterating the government 's argument that eu sanctions would have damaged german reform plans to revive the country 's staggering economy .
but things sounded quite different when listening to opposition leaders , who are currently in tough negotiations with the government over an extensive reform package and will likely attack eichel during a budget debate due to start late tuesday .
" this is a black day for all of europe , " friedrich merz , the christian democratic union 's finance expert , said .
he added that eichel was responsible for burying the pact .
cdu mourns its brain child like merz , many members of the opposition see tuesday 's decision as an unofficial end to the stability pact , saying that by refusing to impose sanctions on germany , the euro zone has been disabled its only tool to guarantee the strength of the euro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu finance expert friedrich merz they mourn the fact that germany , which under the former cdu government pushed for strict adherence to the pact , has now become one of the countries to threaten its survival .
back in 1992 , eu countries had set down so-called convergence criteria for euro zone membership .
they included healthy state budgets , stable exchange rates and low interest rates .
worrying that smaller countries would fail to watch their finances once part of the euro zone , germany wanted more security and in 1996 , the stability and growth pact was created , setting up a system of sanctions for member states which fail to keep budget deficits below three percent of gdp for three years in a row .
a exchange of roles " now there 's a danger that the three big ones , germany , france and italy , will try to sneak around the goals of the pact at the expense of small and medium-size countries who have worked hard to reach those goals , " theo waigel , germany 's finance minister at the time of the pact 's creation , told german public television on tuesday .
" this is an immense loss of face for germany . "
waigel disagreed , however , that the decision to go easy on germany had handed the pact its death sentence .
" it 's not damaged , " he said .
" the countries that damage the pact damage themselves .
without the pact we would n't have this discussion . "

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .
proposals to speed up the transfer of power to the iraqis are " positive , but insufficient and incomplete , " the french president said .
" it seems to me to be set to take place over too long a period . " royal visit part of healing process while the two countries have long enjoyed cordial relations and will celebrate the centennial of the " entente cordiale " next spring , they seem to have hit a rough patch .
" great britain and france are like an old couple , " dennis macshane , the british minister for european affairs , told german public television .
" sometimes they want to kill each other , but they 'd never dream of getting a divorce . "
on monday , the two men announced that next year 's entente anniversary celebrations would show the strength of relations between the two countries .
also , queen elizabeth ii is scheduled to visit france during the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings in normandy , blair announced .
blair to meet aznar as well bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair with jose maria aznar at an earlier meeting in london .
after talks with chirac , blair is expected to welcome spanish prime minister jose maria aznar for a brief meeting .
iraq is unlikely to cause problems between the two men , since aznar emerged as britain 's strongest european ally during the war .
spain has stationed 1,250 troops in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 bank merger calls meet resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would like to see fewer names on the towers in frankfurt 's banking district .
press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .

press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.11.2003 taking aim at alcopops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenagers quickly develop a taste for alcopops , sweet fruit juice mixed with vodka , rum and whisky the days when thrill-seeking teenagers had to raid their parents ' drinks cabinet are long over .
in recent years , advertisers have increasingly focused on young people as the main target group for " alcopops . " marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , has called for a new " sin tax " doubling the price of alcopops .
and her proposal has received high-level support from consumer affairs minister renate künast . the move is designed to stem the growing popularity of alcopops among under-age drinkers . with their eye-catching packaging and snappy but wholesome-sounding names like rigo , breezer and smirnoff ice , the mixed drinks do n't appeal to mature bon vivants , but they certainly tickle the unrefined palate .
and at 89 cents to € 1.80 -lrb- $ 1.05 to $ 2.12 -rrb- a throw , they 're not going to bust the bank either . the drinks may not leave much of a dent in the average teenager 's weekly pocket money , but to the manufacturers , they 're big business .
sales of rigo and breezer make up some 56 percent of bacardi deutschland 's entire turnover .
rival company diageo depends on smirnoff ice for half its profits .
with sales of alcopops rising from 3 to 13 million liters -lrb- 0.8 to 3.4 million gallons -rrb- between 2001 and 2002 , this is clearly an advertiser 's dream come true . a slippery slope alcopop companies have long been charged with deliberately targeting underage drinkers .
that 's one reason why leading politicians now want to introduce tax hikes to clamp down on the flourishing trade . rolf hüllinghorst from the german center for addiction -lrb- dhs -rrb- told german public broadcaster ard he 's convinced companies consciously develop a brand image designed to appeal to young people .
he approves of the proposed price increase and also says that public debate can help bring the matter to the attention of parents . officially , the under-18-year-olds are n't allowed to buy alcopops , but savvy teenagers across the country know that few retailers ever check ids .
the bottled drinks taste strongly of sweet fruit juice rather than alcohol , and critics say this is what makes them dangerous as " starter drugs . "
for inexperienced drinkers , alcopops can be the first step on the slippery slope to substance abuse .
young people grow used to the liquor content - the equivalent of two shots per bottle - and may soon graduate to the hard stuff . a health ministry spokesperson told the berliner zeitung newspaper that any changes to legislation would depend on a recently-commissioned study on the vodka , whisky and rum-based drinks .
it is due for publication in late december . following in france 's footsteps a similar move in france in 1997 caused the market for alcopops to more or less collapse . marion caspers-merk says , " i believe the french example is very promising and viable , and it is in keeping with eu law . " last year in britain , meanwhile , members of the opposition conservative party criticized similar government plans to more than double the tax on alcopops .
sales in britain also boomed in recent years after the drinks were made liable to lower duty than spirits .
this was meant to benefit lower strength alcoholic drinks , but health campaigners argued it led to an increase in alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year-olds . new plans to reverse the exemption angered the uk drinks industry , which accused chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown of threatening jobs . protests from the spirits industry it 's the same story in germany .
the association for the german spirits industry -lrb- bsi -rrb- has been quick to speak out against the proposed tax hikes , arguing that alcopops are legally-manufactured products and the bottles carry labels strictly prohibiting sales to the under-18-year-olds . in an interview with dpa news agency , managing director of bsi angelika wiesgen-pick denied that young people were deliberately targeted by manufacturers and pointed out that " if the gastronomers and retailers do n't stick to the age-restrictions , the manufacturers ca n't be held responsible . " while the spirits industry , politicans and parents are all busy pointing fingers , researchers say alcohol abuse among teenagers is on the rise . according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , bielefeld-based sociologist klaus hurrelmann has conducted a survey that shows that 3.6 percent of 11-year-old boys , 8.2 percent of 13-year-olds and 22.1 percent of 15-year-olds regularly drink alcopops - sobering statistics indeed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .
-lrb- aug.3 , 2003 -rrb- germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2003 bank merger calls meet resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some would like to see fewer names on the towers in frankfurt 's banking district .
press reports that germany ’ s finance minister hans eichel is planning to push for mergers of the country ’ s big banks have been rejected by official sources as untrue . rumors that hans eichel wants to see mergers between several of germany ’ s big banks have been greeted coolly by the banks themselves .
banking executives say such talk should be forgotten as soon as possible .
mergers , they say , will happen if and when they make economic sense , not when politicians say the time is right . " it is completely absurd to believe that politics can push banks into a merger , " a source close to the german banking sector told reuters in reaction to a report in the der spiegel newsweekly saying eichel had urged banks to consider a merger , since he was concerned about the prospect of crisis-ridden german banks being taken over by foreign firms .
a number of foreign players , including credit suisse and royal bank of scotland , have expressed interest in the german market . the german government is denying that eichel ever expressed such views .
a spokesman for the finance ministry described the reports circulating in the press as “ utter nonsense . ”
similar disavowals came from other sources close to the government who attended a recent round of talks on german banking structure between banks and the finance ministry with the heads of deutsche bank , commerzbank , hvb group and dresdner bank . according to a report in the financial times germany , the furor was triggered by the head of the deutsche bank , josef ackermann .
he has repeatedly stressed the importance of getting his bank into good enough shape so as to prevent it falling prey to takeover by a large european competitor . “ there are no big - really big - banks operating in germany .
that is not only a challenge for banks , but for german companies on the whole , " ackermann said at a recent meeting of european bankers .
the profit situation is somewhat worse than the turnover situation , and we have to work on that . ” no takeover plans but deutsche bank sources say ackermann is not planning any acquisitions of his own , at least not imminently .
the priority for the bank at present is to make profits , which is why they are selling further property , which they then rent back .
such a strategy is common among germany 's troubled banks , which are emerging from their worst crisis in more than 50 years .
klaus-peter müller , head of the commerzbank , which has posted significant losses this year , has also ruled out the idea of any spending sprees . analyst dieter hein sees no sign of an oncoming major merger .
he believes the problem in germany is the splintered bank market , which consists of three kinds of banks : state-owned savings banks , co-operative banks and private banks .
hein said that structure means the market share of each individual bank is too small , especially in the case of the larger players .
while mergers could help boost capital and market share , recent takeovers of the hypovereinsbank and dresdner bank have shown many banks have hidden problems that needed to be addressed before mergers could work . " i would say it is very unlikely we will see a merger of two or three of the large banks over the next twelve months , ” hein said . commerzbank head müller is not expecting a takeover , although his bank has been tipped as a potential candidate for the past decade .
he has said he does not believe there will be any major changes to the bank 's current structure until at least the end of 2004 . change the system both he and ackermann are trying to promote a general overhaul of the nation ’ s current banking structure , which would do away with the current three types of banks and clear the way for a consolidation of the sector , which would translate into mergers . the two banking bosses have the backing of the international monetary fund as well as from analyst hein , who firmly believes the german finance minister should liberalize the bank market and scrap the current advantages for state-owned savings banks . “ in merging private banks and saving banks , we would soon see growth and greater efficiency , ” said hein . according to him , the big banks find the dense network of savings and co-op bank branches very attractive .
but most analysts agree , no big mergers are likely to happen in the near future and certainly not before the big banks get their own households in order first . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more trouble for commerzbank germany 's third largest bank is heading for a bleak winter , posting a major third-quarter loss amid more talk of cutting up to 3,000 jobs .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .

british prime minister tony blair met french president jacques chirac in london on monday .
the two seemed to move closer on franco-german plans for an independent eu military force strongly opposed by the u.s. not a sore loser , chirac congratulated blair on england 's rugby world cup victory over the weekend .
the english team beat france in the semi-finals , and the french president complimented the winners on their extraordinary talent .
" this deserved victory is also a victory for europe , " chirac wrote , referring to the cup 's first arrival in the northern hemisphere .
such praise might have helped to soften blair on the french proposal for a european military planning center that could act independently of nato .
" it makes to me complete sense , in circumstances where nato is not engaged , for europe to have the capability and the power to act in the interests of europe and the wider world , " blair said at a press conference after the meeting .
" nato will remain the cornerstone of our defense . "
american president george w. bush , who left london on friday after a three-day state visit , opposes plans for a separate eu military planning unit , saying it would undermine the work of the north atlantic alliance .
british still uneasy about french plans back in september , chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder had tried to win over blair at a trilateral summit in berlin without much success .
the british prime minister agreed that the european union should be able to plan military operations without nato involvement .
but " we do n't agree to anything that will hollow out nato , " blair 's spokesperson said after the meeting .
a month later , the french leader announced that the european defense system should be expanded in " structured cooperation with our british friends . "
chirac 's idea is to set up headquarters for eu troops operating independently of nato 's central office in mons , belgium .
the reasoning is that france , germany , luxembourg and belgium want to be able to command eu military operations in situations where nato as a whole does not want to enter a conflict .
following their meeting , chirac tried to calm fears about the proposed planning center as a rival force to nato .
" neither the germans nor the french wish to take any kind of initiative which contradicts nato , which ... is at the heart of our defense system , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general george robertson has called an eu military planning center unnecessary .
nato general secretary george robertson has called the plan an unnecessary doubling .
nicholas burns , u.s. ambassador to nato , has warned that such a move would create complications and strife .
topics included iraq , terrorism , middle east other topics of discussion during the one-day meeting included the fight against terrorism , the middle east peace process and the situation in iraq .
almost six months after the war there officially ended , relations between britain and france are still rocky .
early in the year , blair and chirac postponed their last summit because of different viewpoints on how to deal with saddam hussein .
the british considered france responsible for blocking a u.n. resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
after monday 's meeting , chirac once again criticized the way the u.s. dealt with iraq .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .

he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .

fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "

it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

"
in an online interview he accused eu states of not doing enough to solve the problem . in a series of damming comments on the eupolitix web site , ariel sharon strongly criticized european anti-semitic sentiments , which he suggested were inherent on the continent .
" what we are facing in europe is an anti-semitism that has always existed and it really is not a new phenomenon , " sharon said .
" this anti-semitism exists and what pushes it is a ' collective anti-semitism ’ that incorporates israel into this equation . "
responding to a recent european union poll which said some 60 percent of europeans believe israel to be the greatest threat to world security , the israeli prime minister said that surging anti-semitism across europe was an attempt to undermine israel ’ s right to defend itself against its enemies .
" there are anti-semites who use the events in israel and the argument that israel uses excessive force and through this they are trying to compromise israel 's right to self-defense , thus there is a danger to jews , " sharon said in the interview .
he added that this provided the perfect opportunity for anti-semites to hide behind .
more eu help required sharon believes there is no distinction in europe between genuine anti-semitism and a legitimate criticism of israel ’ s policies .
" we are talking about collective anti-semitism , " the israeli premier said .
" the state of israel is the jewish state and the attitude towards israel runs accordingly . "
he stressed the dangers of anti-semitism and called on european nations to fight it in every way possible .
he said he did not think eu governments were currently doing enough to tackle the problem , but reserved some praise for those countries that incorporate the fight against anti-semitism into their national curriculum .
" there is a need to teach , there is a need to explain , there is a need to remember what anti-semitism caused in the past , " sharon said .
" danger to jews " in his most controversial statements in the interview , ariel sharon turned his attention to europe ’ s muslim population , declaring that " an even stronger muslim presence in europe is certainly endangering the lives of jewish people . "
as he called on eu nations to do more , he added that the issue had become a political one because of the " huge number of muslims , approximately 17 million , " who live in europe .
praise for italy however critical of europe at large , sharon was full of praise for italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
he praised italian prime minister silvio berlusconi ’ s government for its loyalty and for fighting the tide of negative opinion in europe .
" today , during the italian presidency , we can say that europe ’ s policy is balanced , " sharon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini italian deputy prime minister gianfranco fini , who is currently on a four-day official visit to israel , yesterday denounced italy ’ s fascist past and involvement in the holocaust .
he also called on europe to " uproot the weeds of anti-semitism , " which he said were still festering there .
the visit is part of a personal mission for fini , who is determined to cut his national alliance party ’ s historical links to fascism .
fini was recently reprimanded by eu foreign policy chief javier solana for his public defense of a controversial barrier , known as the " security fence , " which israel is constructing inside the west bank as an aid to " self-defense . "
construction controversy the huge electronic security fence , which cuts many palestinians off from social services , employment and even family , has met with sharp criticism among european union states .
it has been deemed a land grab by palestinians , because it diverges in many places east of israel 's border into occupied territory .
but israel argues that it is crucial for the protection of its citizens from suicide bomb attacks .
in his interview , sharon had a clear message for europeans who don ’ t see eye to eye with his controversial construction plans : " if i am facing the question and the dilemma of whether to absorb european criticism or to add and contribute to the safety of israeli citizens , i have no problem determining how to act .

the government said performance " is improving " , despite the problems .
' properly supported ' according to mr webb only four per cent of claimants have received money since the system was introduced .
he said many parents would be feeling bitter as promised reforms had not been delivered and they were out of pocket as a result .
the tax payer should not be handing over money until these things are made to work , steve webb mp the liberal democrats ' work and pensions spokesman said : " we are talking about families who have broken up , where we need to make sure that the children are being properly supported financially . "
he said that despite the millions spent on the new computer system " lots of parents who are trying to bring up their children , trying to support them , are not getting the money they need " .
the system was supplied by eds at a cost of £ 450m , the daily telegraph reported .
the same company supplied the computer system for the government 's tax credits , which were hit be a series of delays when they were launched earlier this year .
" the tax payer should not be handing over money until these things are made to work , " mr webb said .
significant costs despite government claims that the situation was improving , mr webb said the delay involved significant costs for the people affected .
he said some families would receive more money if they were successfully transferred to the new system and that the government should honour that commitment while the problems continued .
a spokesman for the department for work and pensions told the daily telegraph that mr webb had misused statistics .
he said that of the 53,000 applications processed so far , around 40 per cent ended with the case being closed - meaning more than four per cent of applicants got their money .

since the child support agency system was introduced in april only one third of the 152,000 applications for child maintenance have been processed .
liberal democrat steve webb , who obtained the figures , said families were missing out as a result .
the government said performance " is improving " , despite the problems .
' properly supported ' according to mr webb only four per cent of claimants have received money since the system was introduced .
he said many parents would be feeling bitter as promised reforms had not been delivered and they were out of pocket as a result .
the tax payer should not be handing over money until these things are made to work , steve webb mp the liberal democrats ' work and pensions spokesman said : " we are talking about families who have broken up , where we need to make sure that the children are being properly supported financially . "
he said that despite the millions spent on the new computer system " lots of parents who are trying to bring up their children , trying to support them , are not getting the money they need " .
the system was supplied by eds at a cost of £ 450m , the daily telegraph reported .
the same company supplied the computer system for the government 's tax credits , which were hit be a series of delays when they were launched earlier this year .
" the tax payer should not be handing over money until these things are made to work , " mr webb said .
significant costs despite government claims that the situation was improving , mr webb said the delay involved significant costs for the people affected .
he said some families would receive more money if they were successfully transferred to the new system and that the government should honour that commitment while the problems continued .
a spokesman for the department for work and pensions told the daily telegraph that mr webb had misused statistics .
he said that of the 53,000 applications processed so far , around 40 per cent ended with the case being closed - meaning more than four per cent of applicants got their money .

one heart patient has told bbc wales he waited 24 hours on a trolley in the casualty department at university hospital in cardiff , only to be told that he did not need to be admitted after all .
health workers ' union unison says problems are leading to low morale amongst staff .
bbc wales has also received an anonymous letter claiming to be from the nursing team at uhw expressing concern about patient safety due to a backlog of emergency admissions .
managers at cardiff and vale nhs trust say they are taking measures to improve the situation .
haydn hopkins was admitted to casualty at university hospital after being taken seriously ill at work .
" i arrived at about two o 'clock and was seen very quickly by staff , " he said .
" it was eventually decided that i should be admitted but should be prepared for a long wait .
as a result of not being admitted , to carry out subsequent tests i 've had to go private haydn hopkins " i was told that if a bed became available in the night i would be taken up - but one did n't . "
mr hopkins waited all night , and was told the next morning that he would not be admitted .
" as a result of not being admitted , to carry out subsequent tests i 've had to go private , which has been very expensive . "
he said he sympathised with staff at the hospital .
" they worked so hard and under very difficult conditions . "
he added : " it was apparent that they were very unhappy about the situation . "
last week , glan clwyd hospital in bodelwyddan , north wales , apologised after an 87-year-old woman who suffered a stroke was forced to wait in the back of an ambulance for two hours before a bed became available .
elizabeth jones was forced to wait as the accident and emergency department was full .
haydn hopkins was taken seriously ill at work a hospital spokesman said they would be looking at their procedures to see if they could make any improvements , but admitted that mrs jones ' situation was not unprecedented .
at the beginning of november , wales ' biggest hospital , the university hospital of wales in cardiff , left patients waiting in ambulances outside the accident and emergency department because of a shortage of space inside .
at the time , a spokeswoman said only a small number of patients with minor injuries were delayed and no one was treated inside an ambulance .
on friday evening , the welsh assembly government responded to mrs jones ' case , and the other problems .
in a statement it said all emergency pressures were being monitored , and the government was now planning to hold a summit with all interested parties .
this would discuss the " range of measures already in place to deal with the pressures ... over the winter , and to ensure that planning is fully in place throughout the service . "

however , the cornwall partnership nhs trust is also warning that at times its services are being overstretched .
at a public board meeting to be held on tuesday , managers of the trust , which cares for people with mental health problems , will congratulate staff for their role in the trust 's recovery plan .
developments monitored the £ 31m debts were passed on to the county 's new health trusts when they took over from the old health authority .
the trusts are now attempting to find the money while trying to maintain services .
as well as tackling a funding crisis , the trusts have to modernise the services they provide .
the cornwall partnership nhs trust says its shake-up has been achieved without employing more staff and , in some cases , with reduced staff numbers .
but it claims that although savings are being made , it is at times overstretched .
at the tuesday meeting , managers will say that the modernisation and recovery plans have put increased pressure on staff and in the future could affect morale .
they are expected to recommend that the impact of the developments on services are closely monitored .

the mast at wishaw , near sutton coldfield , west midlands , prompted a number of protests by villagers who blamed it for a cluster of cancer cases .
the 22-metre mast fell down on bonfire night after bolts were removed from the base , in what police described as an act of vandalism .
residents have now bought the mast from a scrap yard and plan to sell parts of it off as souvenirs .
overnight vigils funds raised from the sale will go towards the residents ' campaign to stop a new mast being re-erected .
protestor derek villanueva said the message was " piece of mast , peace of mind . "
following the removal of the mast , villagers staged a blockade at the site to stop a new one being erected .
villagers said the mast would go back up " over their dead bodies " .
crown castle communications , had said it would work with the residents to find an alternative site .
but then the company changed its mind following a statement from mobile phone network t-mobile , which said it was determined to put the mast back up .

mr perben said the muslim scarf , worn by the juror at a trial in bobigny , north-east of paris , was contrary to the principle of impartiality .
he said he did not want open signs of religious commitment in french courts .
the french government has been split on whether to ban headscarves in public institutions because of its policy of strict secularism .
a heated debate is continuing over whether the scarves worn by many muslim women are acceptable in schools , courts and government departments .
in recent months , several girls have been suspended from french schools for wearing them .
france has the largest muslim community in the european union , numbering about five million people .
explaining his decision to have the woman dismissed , mr perben said : " the justice system must show its ability to be dispassionate and to be impartial and this is why this kind of outward demonstration is not acceptable . "
the woman had attended the jury selection procedure at the court in bobigny without a headscarf , but wore one on the first day of the trial .

the tote , or horserace totalisator board , was founded by winston churchill in 1928 as a safe haven for punters , controlled by the state , and beyond the reach of illegal bookmakers .
it enjoys a monopoly of horse race pool-betting in exchange for a guarantee that money is pumped into the sport every year .
recently the tote announced half-year profits had jumped 39 % to £ 9.2m , with turnover up by over 50 % to almost £ 700m .
with privatisation now on the way , and sale to a horse racing trust , the tote is poised for an even stronger new lease of life .
long-term proposal in 1993 the british horseracing board -lrb- bhb -rrb- was set up , with the takeover of the tote as one of its founding aims .
the government looks like choosing the worst possible of all options warwick bartlett , association of british bookmakers " we are delighted that government has recently reaffirmed its intention to sell the tote to a racing trust , " says the board 's communications manager alan delmonte .
" that was the basis of the joint racing-tote proposal put to the government four years ago .
" we believe that the sale to a trust on appropriate terms is in the best interests of both the tote and racing , to which the tote is a key contributor . "
bookmakers unhappy tote chairman peter jones also supports the creation of a trust .
as part of the government 's plans for the sale to such a trust , the tote is looking for a discount of about 50 % on its market value , which is expected to be put at around £ 150m , leaving the tote to pay £ 75m .
however , rival bookmakers coral , william hill and ladbrokes believe the tote is worth more than that , and there are claims the taxpayer is being short-changed , with the true value nearer £ 250m .
warwick bartlett is chairman of the association of british bookmakers , and chair of global betting and gaming consultants .
tote betting the winner is paid according to the size of the stake in the pool the tote subtracts expenses and tax then pays the remainder equally among winning tickets the greater the number of winning tickets , the lower the payout to each winner last-minute backing of a particular horse can dramatically change payouts the pot increases with the volume of bets so if nobody wins the jackpot rolls over there are no limits on prizes " the government looks like choosing the worst possible of all options - the tote should be sold at market price and in a way that allows competition , " he recently told bbc news online .
" there has been a lot of talk about it being gifted at a price below market value , which is unfair on the taxpayer who will in effect be subsidising the sale . "
and he is unhappy at the cosy arrangement that appears to have been drawn up by the government and racing industry .
he said : " there is no reason why other bookmakers should not be allowed to bid for it .
" but the tote does have a lot of support among the racing industry , which wants to get its hands on it .
" they think it is going to be a new klondike for them , but it has to be run efficiently , and that will take a lot of hard work , " he added .
tote battle bookies have expressed a willingness to join in the race for the tote .
mr bartlett says if the tote is sold to a trust then it should have to face competition and not be given any form of extended monopoly .
he says : " if any bookmaker wants to operate pooled-betting then they should be free to do so . "
peter jones : " tote competing across all channels " betting group ladbrokes has threatened to launch a rival pool betting operation if the government does not let it bid to run the tote .
ladbrokes has argued that if bookmakers such as itself , william hill and coral are not allowed to play a role in the tote 's privatisation , then pooled betting should be opened up to more competition .
but tote chairman peter jones said : " what the other bookmakers have tried to do is bid up the figure and put it out of the reach of the tote . "
growing turnover in the past six years ago the tote has grown from 200 to 450 outlets the installation of fixed-odds betting terminals in 400 of the tote 's betting shops has also been a major factor in increased turnover .
but the tote still has less than 5 % of the betting market , and operators like ladbrokes believe they could increase the amount of pooled betting in the gambling market .
however mr jones says " the tote keeps getting stronger " .
" our strategy of competing through all the channels -lrb- racecourse , high street , phone and internet -rrb- and across a range of bets means that we have a balanced business . "
joint venture the government has been under pressure from the office of fair trading to scrap the tote 's monopoly on pooled betting .
the tote is not owned by any defined entity so the government would need to renationalise it then sell it off .
although the government does not own the tote it exerts control over it through the composition of the board of directors .
legislation will probably prohibit the company being sold on in its entirety after privatisation .
however , it could expand by creating a joint venture with a rival betting group or a private equity firm .
" i 'm sure the government would n't allow racing to make a quick buck , " the tote chairman said .

the 14 producers object to the motion picture association of america 's -lrb- mpaa -rrb- ban on sending preview videos of their films to movie award judges .
the producers want $ 25m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- damages , saying they will win fewer awards and so the financing they get will suffer .
director robert altman 's sandcastle 5 productions is among the plaintiffs .
sandcastle 5 made gosford park , which went on to pick up a string of awards including one oscar .
piracy the other companies behind the lawsuit include salty features , run by eva kolodner , who produced the highly acclaimed drama boys do n't cry .
the mpaa said it introduced the ban on sending out preview " screener " videos and dvds because they were often pirated .
the ban applies to all awards except the oscars , whose voters are exempt on the condition that they agree not to let their copies fall into the hands of pirates .
but the producers , who filed the lawsuit in us district court in manhattan on monday , said the ban would " chill the financing of independent films " .
' misguided ' " awards and accolades beget more awards and accolades , which culminate for the awards season with the academy awards , " the lawsuit said .
mpaa spokesman rich taylor said the legal action was misguided because the ban would " reduce piracy and ... preserve the motion picture industry for filmmakers , both large and small " .
it was not intended to disadvantage independent films , he said .
voters of award ceremonies such as the golden globes and the baftas will have to watch the possible contenders at special cinema screenings .
that is thought to be bad for independent films because the voters may be less inclined to watch them than they would if they had a video or dvd in their home .

more than 700,000 young thais are now playing ragnarok online , a massive multiplayer online role-playing game , which has taken asia by storm .
once registered , players can roam vast digital landscapes , collecting items and interacting with other players wherever they are in the real world .
the game has proved so popular that many fans have been playing long into the night .
this raised concerns that thai children were missing out on other important activities like study and sleep .
the problem became so great that the thai government imposed a curfew almost six months ago .
computer literacy most people usually have computers for the interests of entertainment , games and at a later stage they will look into other content sherman tan , asiasoft president over-18s can still play on into the small hours .
after registering at a post office , they are given an adult user id that will work day or night .
for younger players without the special logon , the game simply stops working at 10pm .
ragnarok 's creators , asiasoft , say they understand the thai authorities ' concerns .
but they also think that computer games can help introduce technology to the developing world .
" we feel that to improve information technology literacy you need to have some kind of interest to attract people to have their hands on a computer , " said sherman tan , asiasoft president .
" most people usually have computers for the interests of entertainment , games and at a later stage they will look into other content . "
but is it really the government 's job to decide what 's best for the nation 's youth after dark ?
drop in gaming ministers defend the government 's decision to step in , given the concerns from parents that their children were becoming obsessed with gaming .
" in the developed countries or in the western countries , parents have enough time to look after their children , " said dr surapong suebwonglee , thai minister for information and communication technology .
" but in the developing world , in thailand , the parents , especially those parents who have teenage children , they must work very hard and they work until very late at night so they do n't have the time to look after their children properly . "
the government say it has seen a significant drop in the number of nocturnal players since the curfew was imposed .
but children can be very inventive when it comes to bending the rules .
if the parents let their children use their ids , there is no way the government can stop them playing after 10 o 'clock at night .
if there is a craze that catches a child 's attention , it is hard to tear them away .
but at least as they play video games , they are becoming more computer literate , which surely can not be a bad thing .

once registered , players can roam vast digital landscapes , collecting items and interacting with other players wherever they are in the real world .

this raised concerns that thai children were missing out on other important activities like study and sleep .

after registering at a post office , they are given an adult user id that will work day or night .
for younger players without the special logon , the game simply stops working at 10pm .
ragnarok 's creators , asiasoft , say they understand the thai authorities ' concerns .
but they also think that computer games can help introduce technology to the developing world .

but is it really the government 's job to decide what 's best for the nation 's youth after dark ?
drop in gaming ministers defend the government 's decision to step in , given the concerns from parents that their children were becoming obsessed with gaming .
" in the developed countries or in the western countries , parents have enough time to look after their children , " said dr surapong suebwonglee , thai minister for information and communication technology .
" but in the developing world , in thailand , the parents , especially those parents who have teenage children , they must work very hard and they work until very late at night so they do n't have the time to look after their children properly . "
the government say it has seen a significant drop in the number of nocturnal players since the curfew was imposed .
but children can be very inventive when it comes to bending the rules .
if the parents let their children use their ids , there is no way the government can stop them playing after 10 o 'clock at night .
if there is a craze that catches a child 's attention , it is hard to tear them away .
but at least as they play video games , they are becoming more computer literate , which surely can not be a bad thing .

the 14 producers object to the motion picture association of america 's -lrb- mpaa -rrb- ban on sending preview videos of their films to movie award judges .
the producers want $ 25m -lrb- £ 15m -rrb- damages , saying they will win fewer awards and so the financing they get will suffer .
director robert altman 's sandcastle 5 productions is among the plaintiffs .
sandcastle 5 made gosford park , which went on to pick up a string of awards including one oscar .
piracy the other companies behind the lawsuit include salty features , run by eva kolodner , who produced the highly acclaimed drama boys do n't cry .
the mpaa said it introduced the ban on sending out preview " screener " videos and dvds because they were often pirated .
the ban applies to all awards except the oscars , whose voters are exempt on the condition that they agree not to let their copies fall into the hands of pirates .
but the producers , who filed the lawsuit in us district court in manhattan on monday , said the ban would " chill the financing of independent films " .
' misguided ' " awards and accolades beget more awards and accolades , which culminate for the awards season with the academy awards , " the lawsuit said .
mpaa spokesman rich taylor said the legal action was misguided because the ban would " reduce piracy and ... preserve the motion picture industry for filmmakers , both large and small " .
it was not intended to disadvantage independent films , he said .
voters of award ceremonies such as the golden globes and the baftas will have to watch the possible contenders at special cinema screenings .
that is thought to be bad for independent films because the voters may be less inclined to watch them than they would if they had a video or dvd in their home .

just as nine spoonfuls of sugar ruin a cup of tea , nine different stories spoil a good film .
in the case of richard curtis 's directorial debut , love actually , his confection is so sweet it is almost impossible to finish .
curtis , of course , is the writer behind the smash hits four weddings and funeral , bridget jones 's diary and notting hill - not to mention blackadder and numerous other tv credits .
read your reviews curtis and his working title partners are clearly believers in the old adage that if ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
so once more we have a group of articulate , middle-class londoners struggling with their love lives and loved ones .
martine mccutcheon plays her role well as a director of his own material , curtis is crying out for the editing skills of a less indulgent hand .
he can knock out romantic comedies as easily as the rest of us breathe .
but love actually only serves to prove another old adage that you can have too much of a good thing .
what is good here - and there is much that is very good - is diminished by too many distracting plot lines and unnecessary characters .
one look at the movie poster will tell you that this is a film not lacking in star turns , but at about 10 minutes of screen time per actor , they are only turns , not performances .
bill nighy almost steals the show as a cynical rock star hugh grant reprises his lovable posh bloke routine - this time as an impossibly youthful prime minister - while emma thompson , alan rickman and colin firth all try to bring a bit of depth to proceedings .
martine mccutcheon plays her appallingly underwritten role very well , rowan atkinson supplies another vintage cameo and bill nighy almost steals the entire film as a cynical rock star with curtis 's best lines .
love actually is not a very good film - it 's lots of bits of good films with some duff films thrown in too .
but its irresistibly optimistic message , strong cast and clever marketing will make it more of a cracker than a turkey this christmas .
back to top this review is now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i loved this film , brilliant cast , great story and with a happy ending - what more could you ask for ! ! -lrb- except to see hugh grant doing that dance naked -rrb- .
ali , uk there are good points and bad points about this film .
in some instances , you are clutching your side with hearty laughter , in others , hiding your eyes with annoyance at the cheesy romanticism which richard curtis is famed for .
there are also too many big names and cameos in this movie for you to really relax and enjoy what 's happening .
creditable performances from young thomas sangster who plays sam -lrb- and is also a cousin of hugh grant -rrb- , a lovesick ten-year-old , whilst the more recognisable martine mccutcheon shines far more on the big screen than in anything she 's done for tv .
for laughs 8/10 , plot 6/10 , cheesy love 10/10 !
a real date movie and a gem for christmas - go see it now !
nev cameron , newcastle , uk i saw this film last night , i laughed , i smiled , i laughed louder , i left the cinema smiling and so did everyone else .
hands down it 's the best film i 've seen all year -lrb- until return of the king that is ! -rrb-
mathew gard , uk absolutely fantastic .
whole film was brilliant .
hugh and colin are just the best .
lynette , basingstoke , uk matthew slater has totally missed the point .
i saw the film in an american cinema -lrb- dangerous though that proved to be at one point in the film ! -rrb- and thought it was a really clever piece of ensemble writing .
although not all plots came together at the end it was so well put together that it felt whole and complete .
the rare and believable transformations in the characters were a smoothly executed piece of writing and the humour was fast and fresh .
it is so easy to go to the cinema and be bombarded with negativity at the moment - we all need a film like love actually occasionally to show us that there is some fun left in life - and even some love ! !
mike gilfillan , uk / usa it does n't matter if the movie 's too sentimental or what not .
what made this movie great and a must-see is the feeling it passes on to the people who have seen it .
i went with my girlfriends and had a blast , laughing one moment and close to tears the next .
this movie brought out the " love " in all of us , for after the film , there were so many couples , young and old , who were kissing away .
now , that 's one powerful movie and really , that 's the purpose of watching films .
movies are suppose to inspire , entertain and project a certain message and as for love actually , it has done all of the above .
bravo !
charmaine , victoria , canada as an american twenty-something who was born and raised in milwaukee , it was hilarious to see the portrayal of the typical american bar .
milwaukee is the last place anyone would think of to find hot american women .
and , because of the movie , i came to the realisation that most of my girlfriends and i find british accents quite sexy .
emma , chicago , usa as a brit living on the other side of " the pond " , i loved it , actually .
just as life contracts into a series of moments , we delve into some of the salient seconds of the characters ' lives .
any sweetness is tempered by some bitter vignettes ; witness actress laura linney 's love for her violent , mentally ill brother .
love , actually , and loss , and sacrifice , and unfulfilled longing , and the magic of finding " the one " .
i just wish that curtis would write speeches for tony blair .
lisa davis , usa my girlfriend dragged me to see this but once i was in the chair i thought let 's give it a chance and approach it with an open mind .
within minutes all of my fears were realised .
curtis has a formula to his work and it is dire .
pick a song that will have the desired emotional effect on the audience and then drag out a scene around it .
songbird , then nora jones , then more tears .
at one point i expected the words " feel sad " to appear on the screen .
it was so unsubtle it was vulgar .
the same applies to when he wants the audience to feel happy : play jump and cue hugh grant dancing like a fool .
how hilarious ! !
the only positive aspects of this film is the acting by a select few .
it is a credit to rowan atkinson , bill nighy and liam neeson that they can remain credible and enjoyable with such utter garbage .
and i thought notting hill was bad .
gees ! !
james , uk i really liked this film , i liked the comedy side of it and the love side of it too .
it was hilarious and at the same time could make you cry -lrb- i did n't cry of course -rrb- ... i would reccomend anyone to go see this film , and i also love how it links in with present day , with the president 's visit .
these small touches make the film great .
go see it now !
poddy , uk bill nighy is a god ! !
if he is not no1 for christmas , well you can call me scrooge as i will be cancelling christmas !
worth the ticket price alone !
mrs h , england thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen .
curtis tries to do a pulp fiction - linking of several stories and fails miserably .
the stories and characters are too numerable to have any depth .
the script is abysmal and simply serves to stereotype some of the characters .
nathalie , the working class girl from wandsworth uttering expletives because they could n't think of anything better for her to say is one such example .
mental illness is given a patronising nod and the funeral seen is an insult to anyone recently bereaved , all in all , it is terrible .
i want my money back !
anon , uk this may not be the greatest film ever made but it does put a smile on your face and leaves you with a warm glow .
bill nighy 's old rocker was brilliant , hugh was good as the top man , all and all this was a really enjoyable film .
eric johnson , england i loved this film , the fact that some of the critics did n't just goes to show what cynics they are .
the different strands of the story are brilliantly interwoven , and all the performances are excellent , particularly bill nighy and emma thomson .
the soundtrack is also very enjoyable .
this is a film that sends you out of the cinema happy and upbeat - and there are n't many of those these days .
sophie ahmed , uk i love this movie !
i do n't care what anybody else who did n't care for it will say - though , i respect your opinions ...
but , this movie was fun , sweet , emotional , well acted ... inspiring ... just right and surprisingly wonderful !
so there , go see it if you have n't and i dare you not to come out more open , lighter about life ... -lrb- and if you do n't , well , you need some lovin ' bad ! -rrb-
jander lacerda , ny , usa with its superb cast and pedigree , i really wanted to like this film as much as those written by curtis in the past .
however , both my wife and i left the cinema feeling cheated as there were many interesting characters you never got to know whereas as other story strands were a complete waste of time .
the involvement of four couples would have been quite sufficient instead of the chaotic mess to which the audience is subjected .
with an overabundance of past pop hits , this really felt like a " best of " album with most of the cast giving reheated repeats of performances in better films .
if you think the underused bill nighy is good here , check out his first role as a faded rock star in the underrated and little seen still crazy , which properly uses a ensemble cast .
still , i think we were in the minority as the audience clapped at the end of the packed performance we attended .
chris , tunbridge wells , uk absolutely fantastic - if that 's not the best film ever then i do n't know what 's wrong with people .
i hope bill nighy gets to number one - it 's such a good song ...
lucy , north yorkshire , england i was very disappointed in this film .
not enough time was allocated to the development of any one character or any one storyline and as such , i did n't feel there was any sentiment present .
this and the fact that the file is evidently over-hyped , ensures that i wo n't be recommending anyone wastes the price of a cinema ticket .
not as good as that other over-hyped effort , notting hill , and should n't be dignified with a comparison to the fantastic four weddings ...
pamela , scotland thought it was very funny , but maybe could of got rid of some of the couples -lrb- especially andrew lincoln and keira knightley 's -rrb- .
but , i thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again .
kate , uk very disappointing ! ! !
i think all but one of the funny scenes are in the tv advert for the film .
it 's not a patch on notting hill or bridget jones .
go see kill bill instead - it 's much funnier !
julie , newcastle , uk i enjoyed it a little but was expecting some substance or some sort of plot .
it it was n't for bill nighy i would say it was a waste of time .
i bit over rated i would say .
loved about a boy , excellent film i would see again and again .
this one once was definitely enough ! ! !
maria crossley , england the title says it all - if you do n't want to see sentimental stories then do n't go and see it .
the clear star is martine mccutcheon , and it 's very funny at parts .
i quite enjoyed it , ' cos sometimes all you want to watch is nothing deep , unlike most films coming out with the lead up to the oscars !
anon , wales best thing about it was for the first time in ages i actually liked the prime minister .
take note , tony .
rick , scotland -lrb- living in ireland -rrb- what 's wrong with a bit of good old-fashioned schlock every now and then ?
guy chapman , uk this film is sweet , funny and sometimes quite sad .
you find yourself laughing one minute and then quite tearful the next .
this film would not appeal to everybody and i do think to really to enjoy it you have to be in a good relationship yourself .
marrina , england i think that love actually is the best film i have seen in ages .
i laughed all the way through and at the end of the day i 'd rather laugh than see people beating each other up and killing people .
how depressing is that ?
hugh grant and martine mccutcheon work well together and the rest of the cast are a credit to the film too .
gemma marden , england i did n't like it .
and i normally love soppy and overly sentimental films .
i agree with your reviewer completely - you do n't get to know the characters and therefore do n't care about their situations .
and it just is n't very funny .
there are a few good moments but i was bored mostly .
martine was fabulous though - they should have just made the martine / hugh movie and have been done with it .
-lrb- with emma thompson 's plot as a subplot -rrb- .
humbug !
matt , london i absolutely adored this film , it is remarkably fun and entertaining , which lives up to all the hype .
everyone who leaves the cinema after seeing this film will have a large grin on their face it is such a feel good film .
my only criticism is that the stars really do n't have too much on-screen time , which perhaps is a good thing because you are left wanting more , and are certainly never bored at any point .
i wish i could say that this was an acurate portrayal of life in london , or a true reflection of the experience of love , but i ca n't .
this is quite clearly a work of non fiction , and those who criticise the film for this really are clutching at straws to find flaws with a truly wonderful cinema experience , a must see for all .
gordon , uk surely this is just the right time for some feelgoodness ?
i really enjoyed the film !
but maybe that 's because i 'm a newlywed with a penchant for all things love .
andrea , uk it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye shiona walker , uk i totally agree with your reviewer .
this is a muddled film .
many of the stories fall at the first hurdle and the good ones -lrb- laura linney / brother , emma thompson / alan rickman -rrb- are left unresolved .
there a few good laughs but ultimately the film over long , over simplistic and juggles too many rom coms in the air .
fine for a wet afternoon but this is no notting hill .
glenn meads , uk not as good as notting hill , too many story lines that in two cases leave you less than satisified at the end .
hugh grant & martine mccutcheon do n't feature nearly enough in what could have been a much stronger element to the storyline , bill nighy does indee completely steal the movie .
a fun , but not as memorable watch as those previously penned by richard curtis .
steve , england i saw this last night , and what a lovely film , who cares that it was made up of loads of different scenarios , it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye - am i a softy - yes !
hugh grant does what he does best - is it better than notting hill - by far - bill nighy has to be no 1 for christmas and i hope mr blair watches it and takes note !
it 's a feel good movie and we all need that sometimes .
richard curtis - well done .
shiona walker , uk supremently over-sentimental and laboured - saved only by several very funny-witty moments .
good value , though , for forgettable light entertainment .
dan , uk i am astonished by the critics ' reviews which have accused the film of sickening sentimentality .
at least three of the storylines concentrate on the tragic side of love - balm to all us misanthropes out there , i.e. those of us who are not cocooned in a cuddly relationship -lrb- bah humbug -rrb- .
it was entertaining , well acted , moving and with proper dollops of predictable but appropriate songs in all the right places .
i have n't felt two-and-a-bit hours fly by so effortlessly in the cinema since pirates of the caribbean .
alan simpson , belfast , ni a rom-com without the comedy !
two hours of sentimental drivel .
one for the ladies , i think .
very , very boring !
jim , uk i saw this movie at an advance screening on 16/11/03 and both myself and my partner thought it is the best movie of 2003 .
with so much doom and gloom in the news right now , it was a total breath of fresh air to find something with such a great feel-good factor .
i liked notting hill - but thought that love actually was far , far better .
i shall definitely be seeing it again maxine , uk a rom-com without the comedy ! two hours of sentimental drivel. one for the ladies i think , very , very boring ! jim , uk what a great film - loads of really good performances typical of a curtis production .
hugh grant as the pm was a masterpiece , plus brilliant performance from liam neeson with his on-screen son .
if you liked 4 weddings & notting hill go and see this - it 's even better ... - a perfect christmas film rich , uk for the first 10-15 minutes i thought it was ridiculously over the top and a real disappointment .
i then realised that was the whole point .
once i accepted that , i loved it .
it is the most ' feel good ' feel good movie ever .
emma thompson was fantastic .
not one for the cynics but if you relax and accept a bit of fantasy for an hour and half it will brighten up your week .
judy , uk i thought this film was lovely .
it was nicely pieced together using great actors .
the part with the little boy was so sweet .
no way was it too sentimental .
it was just right .
chanel , wales it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence carl anglim , brit in us i agree that 10 stories are hard to keep sorting out , but i loved the film .
the actors were superb .
i especially liked hugh grant 's prime minister character making his displeasure known over a one-sided relationship with the american president .
believe me , we appreciate our british friends , but we also need friends who stand up to us and tell us the truth , even if its only in a movie .
byron , usa i thought the film was fabtastic .
it is true that some characters and plotlines can get lost , and that it lacks a solid substance , but anyone watching the film , or piece of cinematic art , will find themselves smiling non stop .
it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence and when the world seems to be dealing with so much hate .
i loved the experience and i recommend all to see it , its good for teh heart if nothing else .
carl anglim , brit in usa i loved this film .
it was quite funny in parts and serious in other sections .
however , i can understand why some people may not like it .
it does have a lot of parts and lot of characters .
it may be too sentimental for some but it does have a great cast and some marvelous dialogue .
dave , new jersey brilliant actually !
i enjoyed every minute of this film .
it was touching , soppy , happy escapism , and a welcome relief from our current unsettled reality .
go see it and forget about the angry world for two hours at least .
christine , u.k brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film tom , uk thought it was an ok film however i did think there was a bit too much love , and also the ageing rocker guy really stole the film from hugh grant 's usual performance jake , london , england simply the best film i have seen a long time !
it was superb !
yes , some of the love stories were a little forgotten about at times , and you did have to concentrate a little to follow the links , but with such fantastic acting how could you fail to enjoy it !
and contrary to the criticism levelled at it , the film is not all sweetness and light .
it deals with adultery and loss amongst others .
this film made me laugh , had me on the verge of tears , made me cringe but most of all made me smile , and if we ca n't smile at a christmas film , what can we smile at .
stop being so cynical and enjoy it for what it is - a film about love ! the best of curtis ' films to date !
stephanie mcnaul , northern ireland i really enjoyed the movie , it was a great mixture of brit com .
i thought that the cast was great and i enjoyed the coming together at the end .
i think that the music that linked the stories together was also really well done .
i hope that everyone enjoys this movie as much as me . an actaully loves it !
emily , canada as a brit living in the u.s.a. i am first in line at my local movie theater -lrb- ' cinema ' to the folks back home ! -rrb- whenever a british film is released here .
i am afraid that where " notting hill " had a gooey feelgood effect , " the full monty " a full throttle -lrb- & full frontal ! -rrb- feelgood effect , " love actually " was just cloyingly over-the-top- saccharin that had no effect at all - apart from feeling ' what an -lrb- almost -rrb- total waste of time . '
i say ' almost ' because the only worthwhile bits were observing emma thompson 's undisputable acting ablity & bill nighy hamming it up like a good ' un .
the rest of the movie was a bit of a dead loss , actually .
riki baron , u.s.a. brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
the film assembles most of britains best acting talent - many of which are making movie debuts .
bill nighy is espicially hilarious as has-been popstar billy mack .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film .
merry christmas !
tom , uk i went to see love actually last night with my wife and while she really enjoyed it i felt quite empty as the credits rolled .
what bothered me was a lack of depth to the characters .
they were like bits of people , or characters from other films stuffed together into this one .
it was almost like an episode of friends but without a whole series to get to know and like the people .
ultimately there were some good moments , colin firth was excellent but was also largely unconnected with the rest of the film .
sadly this one will have to go down as a bit of a damp squib .
shane sturrock , uk as well as mccutcheon kris marshall also suffers from a spectacularly underwritten role .
it 's bright , cheery and predictably warm and fuzzy , but not half as sharp or believable as ' four weddings ... '
there 's worse ways to spend a couple of hours during the cold of winter , but surely curtis could have done a lot better this time round with the wealth of talent at his disposal ?
ingmar collinson , uk the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
jonathan harris thought it was a great movie .
a couple of unnecessary story lines but the main ones were quite good .
loved the bit with the pm dancing through 10 downing street .
i was laughing hysterically .
sherry , usa so it is similar to all of the other films but what is wrong with that .
it is a well-acted light hearted , and sometimes very moving look at life and it was a real joy to watch .
all of the actors were playing parts we had seen them do before in other pieces , but bringing them together in one film in a series of inter-related but quite separate plots was quite different .
as you can see , i enjoyed it !
slightly too long and over-drawn in parts but this did not detract from enjoyment .
as for being too sentimental - so what ?
ken sloan , england richard curtis ' formula is starting to get very irritating indeed .
exploiting his audience 's feelings with a cynisicm that gives lie to the supposed ' sentimentalism ' of the film , we have moments of self-plagerism so obvious it insults our intellegence .
we 've all seen ' four weddings ' , so the inclusion of bitter sweet funeral elegies , subtitled miscommunications and revelations of unrequited love are all very tired .
moreover , many of the stories actually remain unresolved , pointing to extremely sloppy editing .
actors such as emma thompson and alan rickman deserve better material than they are given .
over all , a waste of talent on all levels. laura , england love actually is 2 hours of pure sentimentality , delivered by some of the uks finest actors .
i loved it !
and it appears the rest of the packed cinema did also .
richard , maidstone , kent absolutely stunning .
the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
the cumulative emotional impact of the different stories is devastating .
the ideal date movie .
the ideal christmas movie - move over ' it 's a wonderful life ' .
-lrb- and anyone who criticises it for manipulating the audiences ' emotions ... that is what films are supposed to do -rrb- jonathan morris , uk is it sentimental ?
yes .
does it jump from character to character too fast ?
yes .
did i think it was hysterically funny , and sad , and enjoy it immensely ?
yes !
sue whitfield , england its a feel-good film but just a bit over-the-top with its sugary sentimentality .
i saw it in the last states just before its release in the uk and the audition just loved it -lrb- do us brits so continually use the f-word in every sentence ? -rrb- .
the film gets you in the christmas mood but the music is more enjoyable than the storylines .
trish broadley , east grinstead , uk a piece of fluff which was quite inane : to imagine hugh grant as the p.m. falling in love with the tea lady is beyond comprehension -lrb- even in fantasy ! -rrb- .
also , colin firth supposedly falling for a person with whom he could not communnicate stretches one 's imagination even further !
the only word to describe the film is silly ! ! christine tomchak , canada i really enjoyed the ideas behind some of the storylines- the temptation of alan rickman , and emma thomson 's tortuous but dignified reaction .
the idea of the relationship of a career woman being scuppered by her love for her ill brother was also very thought-provoking , but neither of these storylines were adequately probed .
instead , we had a skimming of some fairly feeble and predictable plots , and most of which were already ruined by the advert .
do they get together ?
well they already are in the commercial .
why do they do that ?
the funniest scenes were also ruined in this way .
richard curtis can be side-splittingly funny , but this was just really too sentimental , although easily watchable .
lucy , uk sweet overdose is right .
i pity any diabetics in the audience .
robert del valle , usa for goodness sake stop analysing it and just enjoy it ! !
i saw it during the previews last sunday and loved it , in fact i am going tomorrow to see it again .
i do n't know anyone who has seen it that does n't love it .
liz , uk -lrb- wales -rrb- i totally disagree with the review above - love actually is hilarious , i cried and laughed at the same time .
i left feeling good and would go and see it again .
i think you will find that love actually is brilliant . and sometimes in a world that we live in we forget the one thing that keeps us together .

just as nine spoonfuls of sugar ruin a cup of tea , nine different stories spoil a good film .
in the case of richard curtis 's directorial debut , love actually , his confection is so sweet it is almost impossible to finish .
curtis , of course , is the writer behind the smash hits four weddings and funeral , bridget jones 's diary and notting hill - not to mention blackadder and numerous other tv credits .
read your reviews curtis and his working title partners are clearly believers in the old adage that if ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
so once more we have a group of articulate , middle-class londoners struggling with their love lives and loved ones .
martine mccutcheon plays her role well as a director of his own material , curtis is crying out for the editing skills of a less indulgent hand .
he can knock out romantic comedies as easily as the rest of us breathe .
but love actually only serves to prove another old adage that you can have too much of a good thing .
what is good here - and there is much that is very good - is diminished by too many distracting plot lines and unnecessary characters .
one look at the movie poster will tell you that this is a film not lacking in star turns , but at about 10 minutes of screen time per actor , they are only turns , not performances .
bill nighy almost steals the show as a cynical rock star hugh grant reprises his lovable posh bloke routine - this time as an impossibly youthful prime minister - while emma thompson , alan rickman and colin firth all try to bring a bit of depth to proceedings .
martine mccutcheon plays her appallingly underwritten role very well , rowan atkinson supplies another vintage cameo and bill nighy almost steals the entire film as a cynical rock star with curtis 's best lines .
love actually is not a very good film - it 's lots of bits of good films with some duff films thrown in too .
but its irresistibly optimistic message , strong cast and clever marketing will make it more of a cracker than a turkey this christmas .
back to top this review is now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i loved this film , brilliant cast , great story and with a happy ending - what more could you ask for ! ! -lrb- except to see hugh grant doing that dance naked -rrb- .
ali , uk there are good points and bad points about this film .
in some instances , you are clutching your side with hearty laughter , in others , hiding your eyes with annoyance at the cheesy romanticism which richard curtis is famed for .
there are also too many big names and cameos in this movie for you to really relax and enjoy what 's happening .
creditable performances from young thomas sangster who plays sam -lrb- and is also a cousin of hugh grant -rrb- , a lovesick ten-year-old , whilst the more recognisable martine mccutcheon shines far more on the big screen than in anything she 's done for tv .
for laughs 8/10 , plot 6/10 , cheesy love 10/10 !
a real date movie and a gem for christmas - go see it now !
nev cameron , newcastle , uk i saw this film last night , i laughed , i smiled , i laughed louder , i left the cinema smiling and so did everyone else .
hands down it 's the best film i 've seen all year -lrb- until return of the king that is ! -rrb-
mathew gard , uk absolutely fantastic .
whole film was brilliant .
hugh and colin are just the best .
lynette , basingstoke , uk matthew slater has totally missed the point .
i saw the film in an american cinema -lrb- dangerous though that proved to be at one point in the film ! -rrb- and thought it was a really clever piece of ensemble writing .
although not all plots came together at the end it was so well put together that it felt whole and complete .
the rare and believable transformations in the characters were a smoothly executed piece of writing and the humour was fast and fresh .
it is so easy to go to the cinema and be bombarded with negativity at the moment - we all need a film like love actually occasionally to show us that there is some fun left in life - and even some love ! !
mike gilfillan , uk / usa it does n't matter if the movie 's too sentimental or what not .
what made this movie great and a must-see is the feeling it passes on to the people who have seen it .
i went with my girlfriends and had a blast , laughing one moment and close to tears the next .
this movie brought out the " love " in all of us , for after the film , there were so many couples , young and old , who were kissing away .
now , that 's one powerful movie and really , that 's the purpose of watching films .
movies are suppose to inspire , entertain and project a certain message and as for love actually , it has done all of the above .
bravo !
charmaine , victoria , canada as an american twenty-something who was born and raised in milwaukee , it was hilarious to see the portrayal of the typical american bar .
milwaukee is the last place anyone would think of to find hot american women .
and , because of the movie , i came to the realisation that most of my girlfriends and i find british accents quite sexy .
emma , chicago , usa as a brit living on the other side of " the pond " , i loved it , actually .
just as life contracts into a series of moments , we delve into some of the salient seconds of the characters ' lives .
any sweetness is tempered by some bitter vignettes ; witness actress laura linney 's love for her violent , mentally ill brother .
love , actually , and loss , and sacrifice , and unfulfilled longing , and the magic of finding " the one " .
i just wish that curtis would write speeches for tony blair .
lisa davis , usa my girlfriend dragged me to see this but once i was in the chair i thought let 's give it a chance and approach it with an open mind .
within minutes all of my fears were realised .
curtis has a formula to his work and it is dire .
pick a song that will have the desired emotional effect on the audience and then drag out a scene around it .
songbird , then nora jones , then more tears .
at one point i expected the words " feel sad " to appear on the screen .
it was so unsubtle it was vulgar .
the same applies to when he wants the audience to feel happy : play jump and cue hugh grant dancing like a fool .
how hilarious ! !
the only positive aspects of this film is the acting by a select few .
it is a credit to rowan atkinson , bill nighy and liam neeson that they can remain credible and enjoyable with such utter garbage .
and i thought notting hill was bad .
gees ! !
james , uk i really liked this film , i liked the comedy side of it and the love side of it too .
it was hilarious and at the same time could make you cry -lrb- i did n't cry of course -rrb- ... i would reccomend anyone to go see this film , and i also love how it links in with present day , with the president 's visit .
these small touches make the film great .
go see it now !
poddy , uk bill nighy is a god ! !
if he is not no1 for christmas , well you can call me scrooge as i will be cancelling christmas !
worth the ticket price alone !
mrs h , england thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen .
curtis tries to do a pulp fiction - linking of several stories and fails miserably .
the stories and characters are too numerable to have any depth .
the script is abysmal and simply serves to stereotype some of the characters .
nathalie , the working class girl from wandsworth uttering expletives because they could n't think of anything better for her to say is one such example .
mental illness is given a patronising nod and the funeral seen is an insult to anyone recently bereaved , all in all , it is terrible .
i want my money back !
anon , uk this may not be the greatest film ever made but it does put a smile on your face and leaves you with a warm glow .
bill nighy 's old rocker was brilliant , hugh was good as the top man , all and all this was a really enjoyable film .
eric johnson , england i loved this film , the fact that some of the critics did n't just goes to show what cynics they are .
the different strands of the story are brilliantly interwoven , and all the performances are excellent , particularly bill nighy and emma thomson .
the soundtrack is also very enjoyable .
this is a film that sends you out of the cinema happy and upbeat - and there are n't many of those these days .
sophie ahmed , uk i love this movie !
i do n't care what anybody else who did n't care for it will say - though , i respect your opinions ...
but , this movie was fun , sweet , emotional , well acted ... inspiring ... just right and surprisingly wonderful !
so there , go see it if you have n't and i dare you not to come out more open , lighter about life ... -lrb- and if you do n't , well , you need some lovin ' bad ! -rrb-
jander lacerda , ny , usa with its superb cast and pedigree , i really wanted to like this film as much as those written by curtis in the past .
however , both my wife and i left the cinema feeling cheated as there were many interesting characters you never got to know whereas as other story strands were a complete waste of time .
the involvement of four couples would have been quite sufficient instead of the chaotic mess to which the audience is subjected .
with an overabundance of past pop hits , this really felt like a " best of " album with most of the cast giving reheated repeats of performances in better films .
if you think the underused bill nighy is good here , check out his first role as a faded rock star in the underrated and little seen still crazy , which properly uses a ensemble cast .
still , i think we were in the minority as the audience clapped at the end of the packed performance we attended .
chris , tunbridge wells , uk absolutely fantastic - if that 's not the best film ever then i do n't know what 's wrong with people .
i hope bill nighy gets to number one - it 's such a good song ...
lucy , north yorkshire , england i was very disappointed in this film .
not enough time was allocated to the development of any one character or any one storyline and as such , i did n't feel there was any sentiment present .
this and the fact that the file is evidently over-hyped , ensures that i wo n't be recommending anyone wastes the price of a cinema ticket .
not as good as that other over-hyped effort , notting hill , and should n't be dignified with a comparison to the fantastic four weddings ...
pamela , scotland thought it was very funny , but maybe could of got rid of some of the couples -lrb- especially andrew lincoln and keira knightley 's -rrb- .
but , i thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again .
kate , uk very disappointing ! ! !
i think all but one of the funny scenes are in the tv advert for the film .
it 's not a patch on notting hill or bridget jones .
go see kill bill instead - it 's much funnier !
julie , newcastle , uk i enjoyed it a little but was expecting some substance or some sort of plot .
it it was n't for bill nighy i would say it was a waste of time .
i bit over rated i would say .
loved about a boy , excellent film i would see again and again .
this one once was definitely enough ! ! !
maria crossley , england the title says it all - if you do n't want to see sentimental stories then do n't go and see it .
the clear star is martine mccutcheon , and it 's very funny at parts .
i quite enjoyed it , ' cos sometimes all you want to watch is nothing deep , unlike most films coming out with the lead up to the oscars !
anon , wales best thing about it was for the first time in ages i actually liked the prime minister .
take note , tony .
rick , scotland -lrb- living in ireland -rrb- what 's wrong with a bit of good old-fashioned schlock every now and then ?
guy chapman , uk this film is sweet , funny and sometimes quite sad .
you find yourself laughing one minute and then quite tearful the next .
this film would not appeal to everybody and i do think to really to enjoy it you have to be in a good relationship yourself .
marrina , england i think that love actually is the best film i have seen in ages .
i laughed all the way through and at the end of the day i 'd rather laugh than see people beating each other up and killing people .
how depressing is that ?
hugh grant and martine mccutcheon work well together and the rest of the cast are a credit to the film too .
gemma marden , england i did n't like it .
and i normally love soppy and overly sentimental films .
i agree with your reviewer completely - you do n't get to know the characters and therefore do n't care about their situations .
and it just is n't very funny .
there are a few good moments but i was bored mostly .
martine was fabulous though - they should have just made the martine / hugh movie and have been done with it .
-lrb- with emma thompson 's plot as a subplot -rrb- .
humbug !
matt , london i absolutely adored this film , it is remarkably fun and entertaining , which lives up to all the hype .
everyone who leaves the cinema after seeing this film will have a large grin on their face it is such a feel good film .
my only criticism is that the stars really do n't have too much on-screen time , which perhaps is a good thing because you are left wanting more , and are certainly never bored at any point .
i wish i could say that this was an acurate portrayal of life in london , or a true reflection of the experience of love , but i ca n't .
this is quite clearly a work of non fiction , and those who criticise the film for this really are clutching at straws to find flaws with a truly wonderful cinema experience , a must see for all .
gordon , uk surely this is just the right time for some feelgoodness ?
i really enjoyed the film !
but maybe that 's because i 'm a newlywed with a penchant for all things love .
andrea , uk it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye shiona walker , uk i totally agree with your reviewer .
this is a muddled film .
many of the stories fall at the first hurdle and the good ones -lrb- laura linney / brother , emma thompson / alan rickman -rrb- are left unresolved .
there a few good laughs but ultimately the film over long , over simplistic and juggles too many rom coms in the air .
fine for a wet afternoon but this is no notting hill .
glenn meads , uk not as good as notting hill , too many story lines that in two cases leave you less than satisified at the end .
hugh grant & martine mccutcheon do n't feature nearly enough in what could have been a much stronger element to the storyline , bill nighy does indee completely steal the movie .
a fun , but not as memorable watch as those previously penned by richard curtis .
steve , england i saw this last night , and what a lovely film , who cares that it was made up of loads of different scenarios , it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye - am i a softy - yes !
hugh grant does what he does best - is it better than notting hill - by far - bill nighy has to be no 1 for christmas and i hope mr blair watches it and takes note !
it 's a feel good movie and we all need that sometimes .
richard curtis - well done .
shiona walker , uk supremently over-sentimental and laboured - saved only by several very funny-witty moments .
good value , though , for forgettable light entertainment .
dan , uk i am astonished by the critics ' reviews which have accused the film of sickening sentimentality .
at least three of the storylines concentrate on the tragic side of love - balm to all us misanthropes out there , i.e. those of us who are not cocooned in a cuddly relationship -lrb- bah humbug -rrb- .
it was entertaining , well acted , moving and with proper dollops of predictable but appropriate songs in all the right places .
i have n't felt two-and-a-bit hours fly by so effortlessly in the cinema since pirates of the caribbean .
alan simpson , belfast , ni a rom-com without the comedy !
two hours of sentimental drivel .
one for the ladies , i think .
very , very boring !
jim , uk i saw this movie at an advance screening on 16/11/03 and both myself and my partner thought it is the best movie of 2003 .
with so much doom and gloom in the news right now , it was a total breath of fresh air to find something with such a great feel-good factor .
i liked notting hill - but thought that love actually was far , far better .
i shall definitely be seeing it again maxine , uk a rom-com without the comedy ! two hours of sentimental drivel. one for the ladies i think , very , very boring ! jim , uk what a great film - loads of really good performances typical of a curtis production .
hugh grant as the pm was a masterpiece , plus brilliant performance from liam neeson with his on-screen son .
if you liked 4 weddings & notting hill go and see this - it 's even better ... - a perfect christmas film rich , uk for the first 10-15 minutes i thought it was ridiculously over the top and a real disappointment .
i then realised that was the whole point .
once i accepted that , i loved it .
it is the most ' feel good ' feel good movie ever .
emma thompson was fantastic .
not one for the cynics but if you relax and accept a bit of fantasy for an hour and half it will brighten up your week .
judy , uk i thought this film was lovely .
it was nicely pieced together using great actors .
the part with the little boy was so sweet .
no way was it too sentimental .
it was just right .
chanel , wales it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence carl anglim , brit in us i agree that 10 stories are hard to keep sorting out , but i loved the film .
the actors were superb .
i especially liked hugh grant 's prime minister character making his displeasure known over a one-sided relationship with the american president .
believe me , we appreciate our british friends , but we also need friends who stand up to us and tell us the truth , even if its only in a movie .
byron , usa i thought the film was fabtastic .
it is true that some characters and plotlines can get lost , and that it lacks a solid substance , but anyone watching the film , or piece of cinematic art , will find themselves smiling non stop .
it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence and when the world seems to be dealing with so much hate .
i loved the experience and i recommend all to see it , its good for teh heart if nothing else .
carl anglim , brit in usa i loved this film .
it was quite funny in parts and serious in other sections .
however , i can understand why some people may not like it .
it does have a lot of parts and lot of characters .
it may be too sentimental for some but it does have a great cast and some marvelous dialogue .
dave , new jersey brilliant actually !
i enjoyed every minute of this film .
it was touching , soppy , happy escapism , and a welcome relief from our current unsettled reality .
go see it and forget about the angry world for two hours at least .
christine , u.k brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film tom , uk thought it was an ok film however i did think there was a bit too much love , and also the ageing rocker guy really stole the film from hugh grant 's usual performance jake , london , england simply the best film i have seen a long time !
it was superb !
yes , some of the love stories were a little forgotten about at times , and you did have to concentrate a little to follow the links , but with such fantastic acting how could you fail to enjoy it !
and contrary to the criticism levelled at it , the film is not all sweetness and light .
it deals with adultery and loss amongst others .
this film made me laugh , had me on the verge of tears , made me cringe but most of all made me smile , and if we ca n't smile at a christmas film , what can we smile at .
stop being so cynical and enjoy it for what it is - a film about love ! the best of curtis ' films to date !
stephanie mcnaul , northern ireland i really enjoyed the movie , it was a great mixture of brit com .
i thought that the cast was great and i enjoyed the coming together at the end .
i think that the music that linked the stories together was also really well done .
i hope that everyone enjoys this movie as much as me . an actaully loves it !
emily , canada as a brit living in the u.s.a. i am first in line at my local movie theater -lrb- ' cinema ' to the folks back home ! -rrb- whenever a british film is released here .
i am afraid that where " notting hill " had a gooey feelgood effect , " the full monty " a full throttle -lrb- & full frontal ! -rrb- feelgood effect , " love actually " was just cloyingly over-the-top- saccharin that had no effect at all - apart from feeling ' what an -lrb- almost -rrb- total waste of time . '
i say ' almost ' because the only worthwhile bits were observing emma thompson 's undisputable acting ablity & bill nighy hamming it up like a good ' un .
the rest of the movie was a bit of a dead loss , actually .
riki baron , u.s.a. brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
the film assembles most of britains best acting talent - many of which are making movie debuts .
bill nighy is espicially hilarious as has-been popstar billy mack .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film .
merry christmas !
tom , uk i went to see love actually last night with my wife and while she really enjoyed it i felt quite empty as the credits rolled .
what bothered me was a lack of depth to the characters .
they were like bits of people , or characters from other films stuffed together into this one .
it was almost like an episode of friends but without a whole series to get to know and like the people .
ultimately there were some good moments , colin firth was excellent but was also largely unconnected with the rest of the film .
sadly this one will have to go down as a bit of a damp squib .
shane sturrock , uk as well as mccutcheon kris marshall also suffers from a spectacularly underwritten role .
it 's bright , cheery and predictably warm and fuzzy , but not half as sharp or believable as ' four weddings ... '
there 's worse ways to spend a couple of hours during the cold of winter , but surely curtis could have done a lot better this time round with the wealth of talent at his disposal ?
ingmar collinson , uk the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
jonathan harris thought it was a great movie .
a couple of unnecessary story lines but the main ones were quite good .
loved the bit with the pm dancing through 10 downing street .
i was laughing hysterically .
sherry , usa so it is similar to all of the other films but what is wrong with that .
it is a well-acted light hearted , and sometimes very moving look at life and it was a real joy to watch .
all of the actors were playing parts we had seen them do before in other pieces , but bringing them together in one film in a series of inter-related but quite separate plots was quite different .
as you can see , i enjoyed it !
slightly too long and over-drawn in parts but this did not detract from enjoyment .
as for being too sentimental - so what ?
ken sloan , england richard curtis ' formula is starting to get very irritating indeed .
exploiting his audience 's feelings with a cynisicm that gives lie to the supposed ' sentimentalism ' of the film , we have moments of self-plagerism so obvious it insults our intellegence .
we 've all seen ' four weddings ' , so the inclusion of bitter sweet funeral elegies , subtitled miscommunications and revelations of unrequited love are all very tired .
moreover , many of the stories actually remain unresolved , pointing to extremely sloppy editing .
actors such as emma thompson and alan rickman deserve better material than they are given .
over all , a waste of talent on all levels. laura , england love actually is 2 hours of pure sentimentality , delivered by some of the uks finest actors .
i loved it !
and it appears the rest of the packed cinema did also .
richard , maidstone , kent absolutely stunning .
the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
the cumulative emotional impact of the different stories is devastating .
the ideal date movie .
the ideal christmas movie - move over ' it 's a wonderful life ' .
-lrb- and anyone who criticises it for manipulating the audiences ' emotions ... that is what films are supposed to do -rrb- jonathan morris , uk is it sentimental ?
yes .
does it jump from character to character too fast ?
yes .
did i think it was hysterically funny , and sad , and enjoy it immensely ?
yes !
sue whitfield , england its a feel-good film but just a bit over-the-top with its sugary sentimentality .
i saw it in the last states just before its release in the uk and the audition just loved it -lrb- do us brits so continually use the f-word in every sentence ? -rrb- .
the film gets you in the christmas mood but the music is more enjoyable than the storylines .
trish broadley , east grinstead , uk a piece of fluff which was quite inane : to imagine hugh grant as the p.m. falling in love with the tea lady is beyond comprehension -lrb- even in fantasy ! -rrb- .
also , colin firth supposedly falling for a person with whom he could not communnicate stretches one 's imagination even further !
the only word to describe the film is silly ! ! christine tomchak , canada i really enjoyed the ideas behind some of the storylines- the temptation of alan rickman , and emma thomson 's tortuous but dignified reaction .
the idea of the relationship of a career woman being scuppered by her love for her ill brother was also very thought-provoking , but neither of these storylines were adequately probed .
instead , we had a skimming of some fairly feeble and predictable plots , and most of which were already ruined by the advert .
do they get together ?
well they already are in the commercial .
why do they do that ?
the funniest scenes were also ruined in this way .
richard curtis can be side-splittingly funny , but this was just really too sentimental , although easily watchable .
lucy , uk sweet overdose is right .
i pity any diabetics in the audience .
robert del valle , usa for goodness sake stop analysing it and just enjoy it ! !
i saw it during the previews last sunday and loved it , in fact i am going tomorrow to see it again .
i do n't know anyone who has seen it that does n't love it .
liz , uk -lrb- wales -rrb- i totally disagree with the review above - love actually is hilarious , i cried and laughed at the same time .
i left feeling good and would go and see it again .
i think you will find that love actually is brilliant . and sometimes in a world that we live in we forget the one thing that keeps us together .

just as nine spoonfuls of sugar ruin a cup of tea , nine different stories spoil a good film .
in the case of richard curtis 's directorial debut , love actually , his confection is so sweet it is almost impossible to finish .
curtis , of course , is the writer behind the smash hits four weddings and funeral , bridget jones 's diary and notting hill - not to mention blackadder and numerous other tv credits .
read your reviews curtis and his working title partners are clearly believers in the old adage that if ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
so once more we have a group of articulate , middle-class londoners struggling with their love lives and loved ones .
martine mccutcheon plays her role well as a director of his own material , curtis is crying out for the editing skills of a less indulgent hand .
he can knock out romantic comedies as easily as the rest of us breathe .
but love actually only serves to prove another old adage that you can have too much of a good thing .
what is good here - and there is much that is very good - is diminished by too many distracting plot lines and unnecessary characters .
one look at the movie poster will tell you that this is a film not lacking in star turns , but at about 10 minutes of screen time per actor , they are only turns , not performances .
bill nighy almost steals the show as a cynical rock star hugh grant reprises his lovable posh bloke routine - this time as an impossibly youthful prime minister - while emma thompson , alan rickman and colin firth all try to bring a bit of depth to proceedings .
martine mccutcheon plays her appallingly underwritten role very well , rowan atkinson supplies another vintage cameo and bill nighy almost steals the entire film as a cynical rock star with curtis 's best lines .
love actually is not a very good film - it 's lots of bits of good films with some duff films thrown in too .
but its irresistibly optimistic message , strong cast and clever marketing will make it more of a cracker than a turkey this christmas .
back to top this review is now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i loved this film , brilliant cast , great story and with a happy ending - what more could you ask for ! ! -lrb- except to see hugh grant doing that dance naked -rrb- .
ali , uk there are good points and bad points about this film .
in some instances , you are clutching your side with hearty laughter , in others , hiding your eyes with annoyance at the cheesy romanticism which richard curtis is famed for .
there are also too many big names and cameos in this movie for you to really relax and enjoy what 's happening .
creditable performances from young thomas sangster who plays sam -lrb- and is also a cousin of hugh grant -rrb- , a lovesick ten-year-old , whilst the more recognisable martine mccutcheon shines far more on the big screen than in anything she 's done for tv .
for laughs 8/10 , plot 6/10 , cheesy love 10/10 !
a real date movie and a gem for christmas - go see it now !
nev cameron , newcastle , uk i saw this film last night , i laughed , i smiled , i laughed louder , i left the cinema smiling and so did everyone else .
hands down it 's the best film i 've seen all year -lrb- until return of the king that is ! -rrb-
mathew gard , uk absolutely fantastic .
whole film was brilliant .
hugh and colin are just the best .
lynette , basingstoke , uk matthew slater has totally missed the point .
i saw the film in an american cinema -lrb- dangerous though that proved to be at one point in the film ! -rrb- and thought it was a really clever piece of ensemble writing .
although not all plots came together at the end it was so well put together that it felt whole and complete .
the rare and believable transformations in the characters were a smoothly executed piece of writing and the humour was fast and fresh .
it is so easy to go to the cinema and be bombarded with negativity at the moment - we all need a film like love actually occasionally to show us that there is some fun left in life - and even some love ! !
mike gilfillan , uk / usa it does n't matter if the movie 's too sentimental or what not .
what made this movie great and a must-see is the feeling it passes on to the people who have seen it .
i went with my girlfriends and had a blast , laughing one moment and close to tears the next .
this movie brought out the " love " in all of us , for after the film , there were so many couples , young and old , who were kissing away .
now , that 's one powerful movie and really , that 's the purpose of watching films .
movies are suppose to inspire , entertain and project a certain message and as for love actually , it has done all of the above .
bravo !
charmaine , victoria , canada as an american twenty-something who was born and raised in milwaukee , it was hilarious to see the portrayal of the typical american bar .
milwaukee is the last place anyone would think of to find hot american women .
and , because of the movie , i came to the realisation that most of my girlfriends and i find british accents quite sexy .
emma , chicago , usa as a brit living on the other side of " the pond " , i loved it , actually .
just as life contracts into a series of moments , we delve into some of the salient seconds of the characters ' lives .
any sweetness is tempered by some bitter vignettes ; witness actress laura linney 's love for her violent , mentally ill brother .
love , actually , and loss , and sacrifice , and unfulfilled longing , and the magic of finding " the one " .
i just wish that curtis would write speeches for tony blair .
lisa davis , usa my girlfriend dragged me to see this but once i was in the chair i thought let 's give it a chance and approach it with an open mind .
within minutes all of my fears were realised .
curtis has a formula to his work and it is dire .
pick a song that will have the desired emotional effect on the audience and then drag out a scene around it .
songbird , then nora jones , then more tears .
at one point i expected the words " feel sad " to appear on the screen .
it was so unsubtle it was vulgar .
the same applies to when he wants the audience to feel happy : play jump and cue hugh grant dancing like a fool .
how hilarious ! !
the only positive aspects of this film is the acting by a select few .
it is a credit to rowan atkinson , bill nighy and liam neeson that they can remain credible and enjoyable with such utter garbage .
and i thought notting hill was bad .
gees ! !
james , uk i really liked this film , i liked the comedy side of it and the love side of it too .
it was hilarious and at the same time could make you cry -lrb- i did n't cry of course -rrb- ... i would reccomend anyone to go see this film , and i also love how it links in with present day , with the president 's visit .
these small touches make the film great .
go see it now !
poddy , uk bill nighy is a god ! !
if he is not no1 for christmas , well you can call me scrooge as i will be cancelling christmas !
worth the ticket price alone !
mrs h , england thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen .
curtis tries to do a pulp fiction - linking of several stories and fails miserably .
the stories and characters are too numerable to have any depth .
the script is abysmal and simply serves to stereotype some of the characters .
nathalie , the working class girl from wandsworth uttering expletives because they could n't think of anything better for her to say is one such example .
mental illness is given a patronising nod and the funeral seen is an insult to anyone recently bereaved , all in all , it is terrible .
i want my money back !
anon , uk this may not be the greatest film ever made but it does put a smile on your face and leaves you with a warm glow .
bill nighy 's old rocker was brilliant , hugh was good as the top man , all and all this was a really enjoyable film .
eric johnson , england i loved this film , the fact that some of the critics did n't just goes to show what cynics they are .
the different strands of the story are brilliantly interwoven , and all the performances are excellent , particularly bill nighy and emma thomson .
the soundtrack is also very enjoyable .
this is a film that sends you out of the cinema happy and upbeat - and there are n't many of those these days .
sophie ahmed , uk i love this movie !
i do n't care what anybody else who did n't care for it will say - though , i respect your opinions ...
but , this movie was fun , sweet , emotional , well acted ... inspiring ... just right and surprisingly wonderful !
so there , go see it if you have n't and i dare you not to come out more open , lighter about life ... -lrb- and if you do n't , well , you need some lovin ' bad ! -rrb-
jander lacerda , ny , usa with its superb cast and pedigree , i really wanted to like this film as much as those written by curtis in the past .
however , both my wife and i left the cinema feeling cheated as there were many interesting characters you never got to know whereas as other story strands were a complete waste of time .
the involvement of four couples would have been quite sufficient instead of the chaotic mess to which the audience is subjected .
with an overabundance of past pop hits , this really felt like a " best of " album with most of the cast giving reheated repeats of performances in better films .
if you think the underused bill nighy is good here , check out his first role as a faded rock star in the underrated and little seen still crazy , which properly uses a ensemble cast .
still , i think we were in the minority as the audience clapped at the end of the packed performance we attended .
chris , tunbridge wells , uk absolutely fantastic - if that 's not the best film ever then i do n't know what 's wrong with people .
i hope bill nighy gets to number one - it 's such a good song ...
lucy , north yorkshire , england i was very disappointed in this film .
not enough time was allocated to the development of any one character or any one storyline and as such , i did n't feel there was any sentiment present .
this and the fact that the file is evidently over-hyped , ensures that i wo n't be recommending anyone wastes the price of a cinema ticket .
not as good as that other over-hyped effort , notting hill , and should n't be dignified with a comparison to the fantastic four weddings ...
pamela , scotland thought it was very funny , but maybe could of got rid of some of the couples -lrb- especially andrew lincoln and keira knightley 's -rrb- .
but , i thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again .
kate , uk very disappointing ! ! !
i think all but one of the funny scenes are in the tv advert for the film .
it 's not a patch on notting hill or bridget jones .
go see kill bill instead - it 's much funnier !
julie , newcastle , uk i enjoyed it a little but was expecting some substance or some sort of plot .
it it was n't for bill nighy i would say it was a waste of time .
i bit over rated i would say .
loved about a boy , excellent film i would see again and again .
this one once was definitely enough ! ! !
maria crossley , england the title says it all - if you do n't want to see sentimental stories then do n't go and see it .
the clear star is martine mccutcheon , and it 's very funny at parts .
i quite enjoyed it , ' cos sometimes all you want to watch is nothing deep , unlike most films coming out with the lead up to the oscars !
anon , wales best thing about it was for the first time in ages i actually liked the prime minister .
take note , tony .
rick , scotland -lrb- living in ireland -rrb- what 's wrong with a bit of good old-fashioned schlock every now and then ?
guy chapman , uk this film is sweet , funny and sometimes quite sad .
you find yourself laughing one minute and then quite tearful the next .
this film would not appeal to everybody and i do think to really to enjoy it you have to be in a good relationship yourself .
marrina , england i think that love actually is the best film i have seen in ages .
i laughed all the way through and at the end of the day i 'd rather laugh than see people beating each other up and killing people .
how depressing is that ?
hugh grant and martine mccutcheon work well together and the rest of the cast are a credit to the film too .
gemma marden , england i did n't like it .
and i normally love soppy and overly sentimental films .
i agree with your reviewer completely - you do n't get to know the characters and therefore do n't care about their situations .
and it just is n't very funny .
there are a few good moments but i was bored mostly .
martine was fabulous though - they should have just made the martine / hugh movie and have been done with it .
-lrb- with emma thompson 's plot as a subplot -rrb- .
humbug !
matt , london i absolutely adored this film , it is remarkably fun and entertaining , which lives up to all the hype .
everyone who leaves the cinema after seeing this film will have a large grin on their face it is such a feel good film .
my only criticism is that the stars really do n't have too much on-screen time , which perhaps is a good thing because you are left wanting more , and are certainly never bored at any point .
i wish i could say that this was an acurate portrayal of life in london , or a true reflection of the experience of love , but i ca n't .
this is quite clearly a work of non fiction , and those who criticise the film for this really are clutching at straws to find flaws with a truly wonderful cinema experience , a must see for all .
gordon , uk surely this is just the right time for some feelgoodness ?
i really enjoyed the film !
but maybe that 's because i 'm a newlywed with a penchant for all things love .
andrea , uk it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye shiona walker , uk i totally agree with your reviewer .
this is a muddled film .
many of the stories fall at the first hurdle and the good ones -lrb- laura linney / brother , emma thompson / alan rickman -rrb- are left unresolved .
there a few good laughs but ultimately the film over long , over simplistic and juggles too many rom coms in the air .
fine for a wet afternoon but this is no notting hill .
glenn meads , uk not as good as notting hill , too many story lines that in two cases leave you less than satisified at the end .
hugh grant & martine mccutcheon do n't feature nearly enough in what could have been a much stronger element to the storyline , bill nighy does indee completely steal the movie .
a fun , but not as memorable watch as those previously penned by richard curtis .
steve , england i saw this last night , and what a lovely film , who cares that it was made up of loads of different scenarios , it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye - am i a softy - yes !
hugh grant does what he does best - is it better than notting hill - by far - bill nighy has to be no 1 for christmas and i hope mr blair watches it and takes note !
it 's a feel good movie and we all need that sometimes .
richard curtis - well done .
shiona walker , uk supremently over-sentimental and laboured - saved only by several very funny-witty moments .
good value , though , for forgettable light entertainment .
dan , uk i am astonished by the critics ' reviews which have accused the film of sickening sentimentality .
at least three of the storylines concentrate on the tragic side of love - balm to all us misanthropes out there , i.e. those of us who are not cocooned in a cuddly relationship -lrb- bah humbug -rrb- .
it was entertaining , well acted , moving and with proper dollops of predictable but appropriate songs in all the right places .
i have n't felt two-and-a-bit hours fly by so effortlessly in the cinema since pirates of the caribbean .
alan simpson , belfast , ni a rom-com without the comedy !
two hours of sentimental drivel .
one for the ladies , i think .
very , very boring !
jim , uk i saw this movie at an advance screening on 16/11/03 and both myself and my partner thought it is the best movie of 2003 .
with so much doom and gloom in the news right now , it was a total breath of fresh air to find something with such a great feel-good factor .
i liked notting hill - but thought that love actually was far , far better .
i shall definitely be seeing it again maxine , uk a rom-com without the comedy ! two hours of sentimental drivel. one for the ladies i think , very , very boring ! jim , uk what a great film - loads of really good performances typical of a curtis production .
hugh grant as the pm was a masterpiece , plus brilliant performance from liam neeson with his on-screen son .
if you liked 4 weddings & notting hill go and see this - it 's even better ... - a perfect christmas film rich , uk for the first 10-15 minutes i thought it was ridiculously over the top and a real disappointment .
i then realised that was the whole point .
once i accepted that , i loved it .
it is the most ' feel good ' feel good movie ever .
emma thompson was fantastic .
not one for the cynics but if you relax and accept a bit of fantasy for an hour and half it will brighten up your week .
judy , uk i thought this film was lovely .
it was nicely pieced together using great actors .
the part with the little boy was so sweet .
no way was it too sentimental .
it was just right .
chanel , wales it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence carl anglim , brit in us i agree that 10 stories are hard to keep sorting out , but i loved the film .
the actors were superb .
i especially liked hugh grant 's prime minister character making his displeasure known over a one-sided relationship with the american president .
believe me , we appreciate our british friends , but we also need friends who stand up to us and tell us the truth , even if its only in a movie .
byron , usa i thought the film was fabtastic .
it is true that some characters and plotlines can get lost , and that it lacks a solid substance , but anyone watching the film , or piece of cinematic art , will find themselves smiling non stop .
it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence and when the world seems to be dealing with so much hate .
i loved the experience and i recommend all to see it , its good for teh heart if nothing else .
carl anglim , brit in usa i loved this film .
it was quite funny in parts and serious in other sections .
however , i can understand why some people may not like it .
it does have a lot of parts and lot of characters .
it may be too sentimental for some but it does have a great cast and some marvelous dialogue .
dave , new jersey brilliant actually !
i enjoyed every minute of this film .
it was touching , soppy , happy escapism , and a welcome relief from our current unsettled reality .
go see it and forget about the angry world for two hours at least .
christine , u.k brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film tom , uk thought it was an ok film however i did think there was a bit too much love , and also the ageing rocker guy really stole the film from hugh grant 's usual performance jake , london , england simply the best film i have seen a long time !
it was superb !
yes , some of the love stories were a little forgotten about at times , and you did have to concentrate a little to follow the links , but with such fantastic acting how could you fail to enjoy it !
and contrary to the criticism levelled at it , the film is not all sweetness and light .
it deals with adultery and loss amongst others .
this film made me laugh , had me on the verge of tears , made me cringe but most of all made me smile , and if we ca n't smile at a christmas film , what can we smile at .
stop being so cynical and enjoy it for what it is - a film about love ! the best of curtis ' films to date !
stephanie mcnaul , northern ireland i really enjoyed the movie , it was a great mixture of brit com .
i thought that the cast was great and i enjoyed the coming together at the end .
i think that the music that linked the stories together was also really well done .
i hope that everyone enjoys this movie as much as me . an actaully loves it !
emily , canada as a brit living in the u.s.a. i am first in line at my local movie theater -lrb- ' cinema ' to the folks back home ! -rrb- whenever a british film is released here .
i am afraid that where " notting hill " had a gooey feelgood effect , " the full monty " a full throttle -lrb- & full frontal ! -rrb- feelgood effect , " love actually " was just cloyingly over-the-top- saccharin that had no effect at all - apart from feeling ' what an -lrb- almost -rrb- total waste of time . '
i say ' almost ' because the only worthwhile bits were observing emma thompson 's undisputable acting ablity & bill nighy hamming it up like a good ' un .
the rest of the movie was a bit of a dead loss , actually .
riki baron , u.s.a. brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
the film assembles most of britains best acting talent - many of which are making movie debuts .
bill nighy is espicially hilarious as has-been popstar billy mack .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film .
merry christmas !
tom , uk i went to see love actually last night with my wife and while she really enjoyed it i felt quite empty as the credits rolled .
what bothered me was a lack of depth to the characters .
they were like bits of people , or characters from other films stuffed together into this one .
it was almost like an episode of friends but without a whole series to get to know and like the people .
ultimately there were some good moments , colin firth was excellent but was also largely unconnected with the rest of the film .
sadly this one will have to go down as a bit of a damp squib .
shane sturrock , uk as well as mccutcheon kris marshall also suffers from a spectacularly underwritten role .
it 's bright , cheery and predictably warm and fuzzy , but not half as sharp or believable as ' four weddings ... '
there 's worse ways to spend a couple of hours during the cold of winter , but surely curtis could have done a lot better this time round with the wealth of talent at his disposal ?
ingmar collinson , uk the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
jonathan harris thought it was a great movie .
a couple of unnecessary story lines but the main ones were quite good .
loved the bit with the pm dancing through 10 downing street .
i was laughing hysterically .
sherry , usa so it is similar to all of the other films but what is wrong with that .
it is a well-acted light hearted , and sometimes very moving look at life and it was a real joy to watch .
all of the actors were playing parts we had seen them do before in other pieces , but bringing them together in one film in a series of inter-related but quite separate plots was quite different .
as you can see , i enjoyed it !
slightly too long and over-drawn in parts but this did not detract from enjoyment .
as for being too sentimental - so what ?
ken sloan , england richard curtis ' formula is starting to get very irritating indeed .
exploiting his audience 's feelings with a cynisicm that gives lie to the supposed ' sentimentalism ' of the film , we have moments of self-plagerism so obvious it insults our intellegence .
we 've all seen ' four weddings ' , so the inclusion of bitter sweet funeral elegies , subtitled miscommunications and revelations of unrequited love are all very tired .
moreover , many of the stories actually remain unresolved , pointing to extremely sloppy editing .
actors such as emma thompson and alan rickman deserve better material than they are given .
over all , a waste of talent on all levels. laura , england love actually is 2 hours of pure sentimentality , delivered by some of the uks finest actors .
i loved it !
and it appears the rest of the packed cinema did also .
richard , maidstone , kent absolutely stunning .
the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
the cumulative emotional impact of the different stories is devastating .
the ideal date movie .
the ideal christmas movie - move over ' it 's a wonderful life ' .
-lrb- and anyone who criticises it for manipulating the audiences ' emotions ... that is what films are supposed to do -rrb- jonathan morris , uk is it sentimental ?
yes .
does it jump from character to character too fast ?
yes .
did i think it was hysterically funny , and sad , and enjoy it immensely ?
yes !
sue whitfield , england its a feel-good film but just a bit over-the-top with its sugary sentimentality .
i saw it in the last states just before its release in the uk and the audition just loved it -lrb- do us brits so continually use the f-word in every sentence ? -rrb- .
the film gets you in the christmas mood but the music is more enjoyable than the storylines .
trish broadley , east grinstead , uk a piece of fluff which was quite inane : to imagine hugh grant as the p.m. falling in love with the tea lady is beyond comprehension -lrb- even in fantasy ! -rrb- .
also , colin firth supposedly falling for a person with whom he could not communnicate stretches one 's imagination even further !
the only word to describe the film is silly ! ! christine tomchak , canada i really enjoyed the ideas behind some of the storylines- the temptation of alan rickman , and emma thomson 's tortuous but dignified reaction .
the idea of the relationship of a career woman being scuppered by her love for her ill brother was also very thought-provoking , but neither of these storylines were adequately probed .
instead , we had a skimming of some fairly feeble and predictable plots , and most of which were already ruined by the advert .
do they get together ?
well they already are in the commercial .
why do they do that ?
the funniest scenes were also ruined in this way .
richard curtis can be side-splittingly funny , but this was just really too sentimental , although easily watchable .
lucy , uk sweet overdose is right .
i pity any diabetics in the audience .
robert del valle , usa for goodness sake stop analysing it and just enjoy it ! !
i saw it during the previews last sunday and loved it , in fact i am going tomorrow to see it again .
i do n't know anyone who has seen it that does n't love it .
liz , uk -lrb- wales -rrb- i totally disagree with the review above - love actually is hilarious , i cried and laughed at the same time .
i left feeling good and would go and see it again .
i think you will find that love actually is brilliant . and sometimes in a world that we live in we forget the one thing that keeps us together .

just as nine spoonfuls of sugar ruin a cup of tea , nine different stories spoil a good film .
in the case of richard curtis 's directorial debut , love actually , his confection is so sweet it is almost impossible to finish .
curtis , of course , is the writer behind the smash hits four weddings and funeral , bridget jones 's diary and notting hill - not to mention blackadder and numerous other tv credits .
read your reviews curtis and his working title partners are clearly believers in the old adage that if ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
so once more we have a group of articulate , middle-class londoners struggling with their love lives and loved ones .
martine mccutcheon plays her role well as a director of his own material , curtis is crying out for the editing skills of a less indulgent hand .
he can knock out romantic comedies as easily as the rest of us breathe .
but love actually only serves to prove another old adage that you can have too much of a good thing .
what is good here - and there is much that is very good - is diminished by too many distracting plot lines and unnecessary characters .
one look at the movie poster will tell you that this is a film not lacking in star turns , but at about 10 minutes of screen time per actor , they are only turns , not performances .
bill nighy almost steals the show as a cynical rock star hugh grant reprises his lovable posh bloke routine - this time as an impossibly youthful prime minister - while emma thompson , alan rickman and colin firth all try to bring a bit of depth to proceedings .
martine mccutcheon plays her appallingly underwritten role very well , rowan atkinson supplies another vintage cameo and bill nighy almost steals the entire film as a cynical rock star with curtis 's best lines .
love actually is not a very good film - it 's lots of bits of good films with some duff films thrown in too .
but its irresistibly optimistic message , strong cast and clever marketing will make it more of a cracker than a turkey this christmas .
back to top this review is now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i loved this film , brilliant cast , great story and with a happy ending - what more could you ask for ! ! -lrb- except to see hugh grant doing that dance naked -rrb- .
ali , uk there are good points and bad points about this film .
in some instances , you are clutching your side with hearty laughter , in others , hiding your eyes with annoyance at the cheesy romanticism which richard curtis is famed for .
there are also too many big names and cameos in this movie for you to really relax and enjoy what 's happening .
creditable performances from young thomas sangster who plays sam -lrb- and is also a cousin of hugh grant -rrb- , a lovesick ten-year-old , whilst the more recognisable martine mccutcheon shines far more on the big screen than in anything she 's done for tv .
for laughs 8/10 , plot 6/10 , cheesy love 10/10 !
a real date movie and a gem for christmas - go see it now !
nev cameron , newcastle , uk i saw this film last night , i laughed , i smiled , i laughed louder , i left the cinema smiling and so did everyone else .
hands down it 's the best film i 've seen all year -lrb- until return of the king that is ! -rrb-
mathew gard , uk absolutely fantastic .
whole film was brilliant .
hugh and colin are just the best .
lynette , basingstoke , uk matthew slater has totally missed the point .
i saw the film in an american cinema -lrb- dangerous though that proved to be at one point in the film ! -rrb- and thought it was a really clever piece of ensemble writing .
although not all plots came together at the end it was so well put together that it felt whole and complete .
the rare and believable transformations in the characters were a smoothly executed piece of writing and the humour was fast and fresh .
it is so easy to go to the cinema and be bombarded with negativity at the moment - we all need a film like love actually occasionally to show us that there is some fun left in life - and even some love ! !
mike gilfillan , uk / usa it does n't matter if the movie 's too sentimental or what not .
what made this movie great and a must-see is the feeling it passes on to the people who have seen it .
i went with my girlfriends and had a blast , laughing one moment and close to tears the next .
this movie brought out the " love " in all of us , for after the film , there were so many couples , young and old , who were kissing away .
now , that 's one powerful movie and really , that 's the purpose of watching films .
movies are suppose to inspire , entertain and project a certain message and as for love actually , it has done all of the above .
bravo !
charmaine , victoria , canada as an american twenty-something who was born and raised in milwaukee , it was hilarious to see the portrayal of the typical american bar .
milwaukee is the last place anyone would think of to find hot american women .
and , because of the movie , i came to the realisation that most of my girlfriends and i find british accents quite sexy .
emma , chicago , usa as a brit living on the other side of " the pond " , i loved it , actually .
just as life contracts into a series of moments , we delve into some of the salient seconds of the characters ' lives .
any sweetness is tempered by some bitter vignettes ; witness actress laura linney 's love for her violent , mentally ill brother .
love , actually , and loss , and sacrifice , and unfulfilled longing , and the magic of finding " the one " .
i just wish that curtis would write speeches for tony blair .
lisa davis , usa my girlfriend dragged me to see this but once i was in the chair i thought let 's give it a chance and approach it with an open mind .
within minutes all of my fears were realised .
curtis has a formula to his work and it is dire .
pick a song that will have the desired emotional effect on the audience and then drag out a scene around it .
songbird , then nora jones , then more tears .
at one point i expected the words " feel sad " to appear on the screen .
it was so unsubtle it was vulgar .
the same applies to when he wants the audience to feel happy : play jump and cue hugh grant dancing like a fool .
how hilarious ! !
the only positive aspects of this film is the acting by a select few .
it is a credit to rowan atkinson , bill nighy and liam neeson that they can remain credible and enjoyable with such utter garbage .
and i thought notting hill was bad .
gees ! !
james , uk i really liked this film , i liked the comedy side of it and the love side of it too .
it was hilarious and at the same time could make you cry -lrb- i did n't cry of course -rrb- ... i would reccomend anyone to go see this film , and i also love how it links in with present day , with the president 's visit .
these small touches make the film great .
go see it now !
poddy , uk bill nighy is a god ! !
if he is not no1 for christmas , well you can call me scrooge as i will be cancelling christmas !
worth the ticket price alone !
mrs h , england thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen .
curtis tries to do a pulp fiction - linking of several stories and fails miserably .
the stories and characters are too numerable to have any depth .
the script is abysmal and simply serves to stereotype some of the characters .
nathalie , the working class girl from wandsworth uttering expletives because they could n't think of anything better for her to say is one such example .
mental illness is given a patronising nod and the funeral seen is an insult to anyone recently bereaved , all in all , it is terrible .
i want my money back !
anon , uk this may not be the greatest film ever made but it does put a smile on your face and leaves you with a warm glow .
bill nighy 's old rocker was brilliant , hugh was good as the top man , all and all this was a really enjoyable film .
eric johnson , england i loved this film , the fact that some of the critics did n't just goes to show what cynics they are .
the different strands of the story are brilliantly interwoven , and all the performances are excellent , particularly bill nighy and emma thomson .
the soundtrack is also very enjoyable .
this is a film that sends you out of the cinema happy and upbeat - and there are n't many of those these days .
sophie ahmed , uk i love this movie !
i do n't care what anybody else who did n't care for it will say - though , i respect your opinions ...
but , this movie was fun , sweet , emotional , well acted ... inspiring ... just right and surprisingly wonderful !
so there , go see it if you have n't and i dare you not to come out more open , lighter about life ... -lrb- and if you do n't , well , you need some lovin ' bad ! -rrb-
jander lacerda , ny , usa with its superb cast and pedigree , i really wanted to like this film as much as those written by curtis in the past .
however , both my wife and i left the cinema feeling cheated as there were many interesting characters you never got to know whereas as other story strands were a complete waste of time .
the involvement of four couples would have been quite sufficient instead of the chaotic mess to which the audience is subjected .
with an overabundance of past pop hits , this really felt like a " best of " album with most of the cast giving reheated repeats of performances in better films .
if you think the underused bill nighy is good here , check out his first role as a faded rock star in the underrated and little seen still crazy , which properly uses a ensemble cast .
still , i think we were in the minority as the audience clapped at the end of the packed performance we attended .
chris , tunbridge wells , uk absolutely fantastic - if that 's not the best film ever then i do n't know what 's wrong with people .
i hope bill nighy gets to number one - it 's such a good song ...
lucy , north yorkshire , england i was very disappointed in this film .
not enough time was allocated to the development of any one character or any one storyline and as such , i did n't feel there was any sentiment present .
this and the fact that the file is evidently over-hyped , ensures that i wo n't be recommending anyone wastes the price of a cinema ticket .
not as good as that other over-hyped effort , notting hill , and should n't be dignified with a comparison to the fantastic four weddings ...
pamela , scotland thought it was very funny , but maybe could of got rid of some of the couples -lrb- especially andrew lincoln and keira knightley 's -rrb- .
but , i thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again .
kate , uk very disappointing ! ! !
i think all but one of the funny scenes are in the tv advert for the film .
it 's not a patch on notting hill or bridget jones .
go see kill bill instead - it 's much funnier !
julie , newcastle , uk i enjoyed it a little but was expecting some substance or some sort of plot .
it it was n't for bill nighy i would say it was a waste of time .
i bit over rated i would say .
loved about a boy , excellent film i would see again and again .
this one once was definitely enough ! ! !
maria crossley , england the title says it all - if you do n't want to see sentimental stories then do n't go and see it .
the clear star is martine mccutcheon , and it 's very funny at parts .
i quite enjoyed it , ' cos sometimes all you want to watch is nothing deep , unlike most films coming out with the lead up to the oscars !
anon , wales best thing about it was for the first time in ages i actually liked the prime minister .
take note , tony .
rick , scotland -lrb- living in ireland -rrb- what 's wrong with a bit of good old-fashioned schlock every now and then ?
guy chapman , uk this film is sweet , funny and sometimes quite sad .
you find yourself laughing one minute and then quite tearful the next .
this film would not appeal to everybody and i do think to really to enjoy it you have to be in a good relationship yourself .
marrina , england i think that love actually is the best film i have seen in ages .
i laughed all the way through and at the end of the day i 'd rather laugh than see people beating each other up and killing people .
how depressing is that ?
hugh grant and martine mccutcheon work well together and the rest of the cast are a credit to the film too .
gemma marden , england i did n't like it .
and i normally love soppy and overly sentimental films .
i agree with your reviewer completely - you do n't get to know the characters and therefore do n't care about their situations .
and it just is n't very funny .
there are a few good moments but i was bored mostly .
martine was fabulous though - they should have just made the martine / hugh movie and have been done with it .
-lrb- with emma thompson 's plot as a subplot -rrb- .
humbug !
matt , london i absolutely adored this film , it is remarkably fun and entertaining , which lives up to all the hype .
everyone who leaves the cinema after seeing this film will have a large grin on their face it is such a feel good film .
my only criticism is that the stars really do n't have too much on-screen time , which perhaps is a good thing because you are left wanting more , and are certainly never bored at any point .
i wish i could say that this was an acurate portrayal of life in london , or a true reflection of the experience of love , but i ca n't .
this is quite clearly a work of non fiction , and those who criticise the film for this really are clutching at straws to find flaws with a truly wonderful cinema experience , a must see for all .
gordon , uk surely this is just the right time for some feelgoodness ?
i really enjoyed the film !
but maybe that 's because i 'm a newlywed with a penchant for all things love .
andrea , uk it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye shiona walker , uk i totally agree with your reviewer .
this is a muddled film .
many of the stories fall at the first hurdle and the good ones -lrb- laura linney / brother , emma thompson / alan rickman -rrb- are left unresolved .
there a few good laughs but ultimately the film over long , over simplistic and juggles too many rom coms in the air .
fine for a wet afternoon but this is no notting hill .
glenn meads , uk not as good as notting hill , too many story lines that in two cases leave you less than satisified at the end .
hugh grant & martine mccutcheon do n't feature nearly enough in what could have been a much stronger element to the storyline , bill nighy does indee completely steal the movie .
a fun , but not as memorable watch as those previously penned by richard curtis .
steve , england i saw this last night , and what a lovely film , who cares that it was made up of loads of different scenarios , it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye - am i a softy - yes !
hugh grant does what he does best - is it better than notting hill - by far - bill nighy has to be no 1 for christmas and i hope mr blair watches it and takes note !
it 's a feel good movie and we all need that sometimes .
richard curtis - well done .
shiona walker , uk supremently over-sentimental and laboured - saved only by several very funny-witty moments .
good value , though , for forgettable light entertainment .
dan , uk i am astonished by the critics ' reviews which have accused the film of sickening sentimentality .
at least three of the storylines concentrate on the tragic side of love - balm to all us misanthropes out there , i.e. those of us who are not cocooned in a cuddly relationship -lrb- bah humbug -rrb- .
it was entertaining , well acted , moving and with proper dollops of predictable but appropriate songs in all the right places .
i have n't felt two-and-a-bit hours fly by so effortlessly in the cinema since pirates of the caribbean .
alan simpson , belfast , ni a rom-com without the comedy !
two hours of sentimental drivel .
one for the ladies , i think .
very , very boring !
jim , uk i saw this movie at an advance screening on 16/11/03 and both myself and my partner thought it is the best movie of 2003 .
with so much doom and gloom in the news right now , it was a total breath of fresh air to find something with such a great feel-good factor .
i liked notting hill - but thought that love actually was far , far better .
i shall definitely be seeing it again maxine , uk a rom-com without the comedy ! two hours of sentimental drivel. one for the ladies i think , very , very boring ! jim , uk what a great film - loads of really good performances typical of a curtis production .
hugh grant as the pm was a masterpiece , plus brilliant performance from liam neeson with his on-screen son .
if you liked 4 weddings & notting hill go and see this - it 's even better ... - a perfect christmas film rich , uk for the first 10-15 minutes i thought it was ridiculously over the top and a real disappointment .
i then realised that was the whole point .
once i accepted that , i loved it .
it is the most ' feel good ' feel good movie ever .
emma thompson was fantastic .
not one for the cynics but if you relax and accept a bit of fantasy for an hour and half it will brighten up your week .
judy , uk i thought this film was lovely .
it was nicely pieced together using great actors .
the part with the little boy was so sweet .
no way was it too sentimental .
it was just right .
chanel , wales it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence carl anglim , brit in us i agree that 10 stories are hard to keep sorting out , but i loved the film .
the actors were superb .
i especially liked hugh grant 's prime minister character making his displeasure known over a one-sided relationship with the american president .
believe me , we appreciate our british friends , but we also need friends who stand up to us and tell us the truth , even if its only in a movie .
byron , usa i thought the film was fabtastic .
it is true that some characters and plotlines can get lost , and that it lacks a solid substance , but anyone watching the film , or piece of cinematic art , will find themselves smiling non stop .
it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence and when the world seems to be dealing with so much hate .
i loved the experience and i recommend all to see it , its good for teh heart if nothing else .
carl anglim , brit in usa i loved this film .
it was quite funny in parts and serious in other sections .
however , i can understand why some people may not like it .
it does have a lot of parts and lot of characters .
it may be too sentimental for some but it does have a great cast and some marvelous dialogue .
dave , new jersey brilliant actually !
i enjoyed every minute of this film .
it was touching , soppy , happy escapism , and a welcome relief from our current unsettled reality .
go see it and forget about the angry world for two hours at least .
christine , u.k brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film tom , uk thought it was an ok film however i did think there was a bit too much love , and also the ageing rocker guy really stole the film from hugh grant 's usual performance jake , london , england simply the best film i have seen a long time !
it was superb !
yes , some of the love stories were a little forgotten about at times , and you did have to concentrate a little to follow the links , but with such fantastic acting how could you fail to enjoy it !
and contrary to the criticism levelled at it , the film is not all sweetness and light .
it deals with adultery and loss amongst others .
this film made me laugh , had me on the verge of tears , made me cringe but most of all made me smile , and if we ca n't smile at a christmas film , what can we smile at .
stop being so cynical and enjoy it for what it is - a film about love ! the best of curtis ' films to date !
stephanie mcnaul , northern ireland i really enjoyed the movie , it was a great mixture of brit com .
i thought that the cast was great and i enjoyed the coming together at the end .
i think that the music that linked the stories together was also really well done .
i hope that everyone enjoys this movie as much as me . an actaully loves it !
emily , canada as a brit living in the u.s.a. i am first in line at my local movie theater -lrb- ' cinema ' to the folks back home ! -rrb- whenever a british film is released here .
i am afraid that where " notting hill " had a gooey feelgood effect , " the full monty " a full throttle -lrb- & full frontal ! -rrb- feelgood effect , " love actually " was just cloyingly over-the-top- saccharin that had no effect at all - apart from feeling ' what an -lrb- almost -rrb- total waste of time . '
i say ' almost ' because the only worthwhile bits were observing emma thompson 's undisputable acting ablity & bill nighy hamming it up like a good ' un .
the rest of the movie was a bit of a dead loss , actually .
riki baron , u.s.a. brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
the film assembles most of britains best acting talent - many of which are making movie debuts .
bill nighy is espicially hilarious as has-been popstar billy mack .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film .
merry christmas !
tom , uk i went to see love actually last night with my wife and while she really enjoyed it i felt quite empty as the credits rolled .
what bothered me was a lack of depth to the characters .
they were like bits of people , or characters from other films stuffed together into this one .
it was almost like an episode of friends but without a whole series to get to know and like the people .
ultimately there were some good moments , colin firth was excellent but was also largely unconnected with the rest of the film .
sadly this one will have to go down as a bit of a damp squib .
shane sturrock , uk as well as mccutcheon kris marshall also suffers from a spectacularly underwritten role .
it 's bright , cheery and predictably warm and fuzzy , but not half as sharp or believable as ' four weddings ... '
there 's worse ways to spend a couple of hours during the cold of winter , but surely curtis could have done a lot better this time round with the wealth of talent at his disposal ?
ingmar collinson , uk the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
jonathan harris thought it was a great movie .
a couple of unnecessary story lines but the main ones were quite good .
loved the bit with the pm dancing through 10 downing street .
i was laughing hysterically .
sherry , usa so it is similar to all of the other films but what is wrong with that .
it is a well-acted light hearted , and sometimes very moving look at life and it was a real joy to watch .
all of the actors were playing parts we had seen them do before in other pieces , but bringing them together in one film in a series of inter-related but quite separate plots was quite different .
as you can see , i enjoyed it !
slightly too long and over-drawn in parts but this did not detract from enjoyment .
as for being too sentimental - so what ?
ken sloan , england richard curtis ' formula is starting to get very irritating indeed .
exploiting his audience 's feelings with a cynisicm that gives lie to the supposed ' sentimentalism ' of the film , we have moments of self-plagerism so obvious it insults our intellegence .
we 've all seen ' four weddings ' , so the inclusion of bitter sweet funeral elegies , subtitled miscommunications and revelations of unrequited love are all very tired .
moreover , many of the stories actually remain unresolved , pointing to extremely sloppy editing .
actors such as emma thompson and alan rickman deserve better material than they are given .
over all , a waste of talent on all levels. laura , england love actually is 2 hours of pure sentimentality , delivered by some of the uks finest actors .
i loved it !
and it appears the rest of the packed cinema did also .
richard , maidstone , kent absolutely stunning .
the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
the cumulative emotional impact of the different stories is devastating .
the ideal date movie .
the ideal christmas movie - move over ' it 's a wonderful life ' .
-lrb- and anyone who criticises it for manipulating the audiences ' emotions ... that is what films are supposed to do -rrb- jonathan morris , uk is it sentimental ?
yes .
does it jump from character to character too fast ?
yes .
did i think it was hysterically funny , and sad , and enjoy it immensely ?
yes !
sue whitfield , england its a feel-good film but just a bit over-the-top with its sugary sentimentality .
i saw it in the last states just before its release in the uk and the audition just loved it -lrb- do us brits so continually use the f-word in every sentence ? -rrb- .
the film gets you in the christmas mood but the music is more enjoyable than the storylines .
trish broadley , east grinstead , uk a piece of fluff which was quite inane : to imagine hugh grant as the p.m. falling in love with the tea lady is beyond comprehension -lrb- even in fantasy ! -rrb- .
also , colin firth supposedly falling for a person with whom he could not communnicate stretches one 's imagination even further !
the only word to describe the film is silly ! ! christine tomchak , canada i really enjoyed the ideas behind some of the storylines- the temptation of alan rickman , and emma thomson 's tortuous but dignified reaction .
the idea of the relationship of a career woman being scuppered by her love for her ill brother was also very thought-provoking , but neither of these storylines were adequately probed .
instead , we had a skimming of some fairly feeble and predictable plots , and most of which were already ruined by the advert .
do they get together ?
well they already are in the commercial .
why do they do that ?
the funniest scenes were also ruined in this way .
richard curtis can be side-splittingly funny , but this was just really too sentimental , although easily watchable .
lucy , uk sweet overdose is right .
i pity any diabetics in the audience .
robert del valle , usa for goodness sake stop analysing it and just enjoy it ! !
i saw it during the previews last sunday and loved it , in fact i am going tomorrow to see it again .
i do n't know anyone who has seen it that does n't love it .
liz , uk -lrb- wales -rrb- i totally disagree with the review above - love actually is hilarious , i cried and laughed at the same time .
i left feeling good and would go and see it again .
i think you will find that love actually is brilliant . and sometimes in a world that we live in we forget the one thing that keeps us together .

just as nine spoonfuls of sugar ruin a cup of tea , nine different stories spoil a good film .
in the case of richard curtis 's directorial debut , love actually , his confection is so sweet it is almost impossible to finish .
curtis , of course , is the writer behind the smash hits four weddings and funeral , bridget jones 's diary and notting hill - not to mention blackadder and numerous other tv credits .
read your reviews curtis and his working title partners are clearly believers in the old adage that if ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
so once more we have a group of articulate , middle-class londoners struggling with their love lives and loved ones .
martine mccutcheon plays her role well as a director of his own material , curtis is crying out for the editing skills of a less indulgent hand .
he can knock out romantic comedies as easily as the rest of us breathe .
but love actually only serves to prove another old adage that you can have too much of a good thing .
what is good here - and there is much that is very good - is diminished by too many distracting plot lines and unnecessary characters .
one look at the movie poster will tell you that this is a film not lacking in star turns , but at about 10 minutes of screen time per actor , they are only turns , not performances .
bill nighy almost steals the show as a cynical rock star hugh grant reprises his lovable posh bloke routine - this time as an impossibly youthful prime minister - while emma thompson , alan rickman and colin firth all try to bring a bit of depth to proceedings .
martine mccutcheon plays her appallingly underwritten role very well , rowan atkinson supplies another vintage cameo and bill nighy almost steals the entire film as a cynical rock star with curtis 's best lines .
love actually is not a very good film - it 's lots of bits of good films with some duff films thrown in too .
but its irresistibly optimistic message , strong cast and clever marketing will make it more of a cracker than a turkey this christmas .
back to top this review is now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i loved this film , brilliant cast , great story and with a happy ending - what more could you ask for ! ! -lrb- except to see hugh grant doing that dance naked -rrb- .
ali , uk there are good points and bad points about this film .
in some instances , you are clutching your side with hearty laughter , in others , hiding your eyes with annoyance at the cheesy romanticism which richard curtis is famed for .
there are also too many big names and cameos in this movie for you to really relax and enjoy what 's happening .
creditable performances from young thomas sangster who plays sam -lrb- and is also a cousin of hugh grant -rrb- , a lovesick ten-year-old , whilst the more recognisable martine mccutcheon shines far more on the big screen than in anything she 's done for tv .
for laughs 8/10 , plot 6/10 , cheesy love 10/10 !
a real date movie and a gem for christmas - go see it now !
nev cameron , newcastle , uk i saw this film last night , i laughed , i smiled , i laughed louder , i left the cinema smiling and so did everyone else .
hands down it 's the best film i 've seen all year -lrb- until return of the king that is ! -rrb-
mathew gard , uk absolutely fantastic .
whole film was brilliant .
hugh and colin are just the best .
lynette , basingstoke , uk matthew slater has totally missed the point .
i saw the film in an american cinema -lrb- dangerous though that proved to be at one point in the film ! -rrb- and thought it was a really clever piece of ensemble writing .
although not all plots came together at the end it was so well put together that it felt whole and complete .
the rare and believable transformations in the characters were a smoothly executed piece of writing and the humour was fast and fresh .
it is so easy to go to the cinema and be bombarded with negativity at the moment - we all need a film like love actually occasionally to show us that there is some fun left in life - and even some love ! !
mike gilfillan , uk / usa it does n't matter if the movie 's too sentimental or what not .
what made this movie great and a must-see is the feeling it passes on to the people who have seen it .
i went with my girlfriends and had a blast , laughing one moment and close to tears the next .
this movie brought out the " love " in all of us , for after the film , there were so many couples , young and old , who were kissing away .
now , that 's one powerful movie and really , that 's the purpose of watching films .
movies are suppose to inspire , entertain and project a certain message and as for love actually , it has done all of the above .
bravo !
charmaine , victoria , canada as an american twenty-something who was born and raised in milwaukee , it was hilarious to see the portrayal of the typical american bar .
milwaukee is the last place anyone would think of to find hot american women .
and , because of the movie , i came to the realisation that most of my girlfriends and i find british accents quite sexy .
emma , chicago , usa as a brit living on the other side of " the pond " , i loved it , actually .
just as life contracts into a series of moments , we delve into some of the salient seconds of the characters ' lives .
any sweetness is tempered by some bitter vignettes ; witness actress laura linney 's love for her violent , mentally ill brother .
love , actually , and loss , and sacrifice , and unfulfilled longing , and the magic of finding " the one " .
i just wish that curtis would write speeches for tony blair .
lisa davis , usa my girlfriend dragged me to see this but once i was in the chair i thought let 's give it a chance and approach it with an open mind .
within minutes all of my fears were realised .
curtis has a formula to his work and it is dire .
pick a song that will have the desired emotional effect on the audience and then drag out a scene around it .
songbird , then nora jones , then more tears .
at one point i expected the words " feel sad " to appear on the screen .
it was so unsubtle it was vulgar .
the same applies to when he wants the audience to feel happy : play jump and cue hugh grant dancing like a fool .
how hilarious ! !
the only positive aspects of this film is the acting by a select few .
it is a credit to rowan atkinson , bill nighy and liam neeson that they can remain credible and enjoyable with such utter garbage .
and i thought notting hill was bad .
gees ! !
james , uk i really liked this film , i liked the comedy side of it and the love side of it too .
it was hilarious and at the same time could make you cry -lrb- i did n't cry of course -rrb- ... i would reccomend anyone to go see this film , and i also love how it links in with present day , with the president 's visit .
these small touches make the film great .
go see it now !
poddy , uk bill nighy is a god ! !
if he is not no1 for christmas , well you can call me scrooge as i will be cancelling christmas !
worth the ticket price alone !
mrs h , england thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen .
curtis tries to do a pulp fiction - linking of several stories and fails miserably .
the stories and characters are too numerable to have any depth .
the script is abysmal and simply serves to stereotype some of the characters .
nathalie , the working class girl from wandsworth uttering expletives because they could n't think of anything better for her to say is one such example .
mental illness is given a patronising nod and the funeral seen is an insult to anyone recently bereaved , all in all , it is terrible .
i want my money back !
anon , uk this may not be the greatest film ever made but it does put a smile on your face and leaves you with a warm glow .
bill nighy 's old rocker was brilliant , hugh was good as the top man , all and all this was a really enjoyable film .
eric johnson , england i loved this film , the fact that some of the critics did n't just goes to show what cynics they are .
the different strands of the story are brilliantly interwoven , and all the performances are excellent , particularly bill nighy and emma thomson .
the soundtrack is also very enjoyable .
this is a film that sends you out of the cinema happy and upbeat - and there are n't many of those these days .
sophie ahmed , uk i love this movie !
i do n't care what anybody else who did n't care for it will say - though , i respect your opinions ...
but , this movie was fun , sweet , emotional , well acted ... inspiring ... just right and surprisingly wonderful !
so there , go see it if you have n't and i dare you not to come out more open , lighter about life ... -lrb- and if you do n't , well , you need some lovin ' bad ! -rrb-
jander lacerda , ny , usa with its superb cast and pedigree , i really wanted to like this film as much as those written by curtis in the past .
however , both my wife and i left the cinema feeling cheated as there were many interesting characters you never got to know whereas as other story strands were a complete waste of time .
the involvement of four couples would have been quite sufficient instead of the chaotic mess to which the audience is subjected .
with an overabundance of past pop hits , this really felt like a " best of " album with most of the cast giving reheated repeats of performances in better films .
if you think the underused bill nighy is good here , check out his first role as a faded rock star in the underrated and little seen still crazy , which properly uses a ensemble cast .
still , i think we were in the minority as the audience clapped at the end of the packed performance we attended .
chris , tunbridge wells , uk absolutely fantastic - if that 's not the best film ever then i do n't know what 's wrong with people .
i hope bill nighy gets to number one - it 's such a good song ...
lucy , north yorkshire , england i was very disappointed in this film .
not enough time was allocated to the development of any one character or any one storyline and as such , i did n't feel there was any sentiment present .
this and the fact that the file is evidently over-hyped , ensures that i wo n't be recommending anyone wastes the price of a cinema ticket .
not as good as that other over-hyped effort , notting hill , and should n't be dignified with a comparison to the fantastic four weddings ...
pamela , scotland thought it was very funny , but maybe could of got rid of some of the couples -lrb- especially andrew lincoln and keira knightley 's -rrb- .
but , i thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again .
kate , uk very disappointing ! ! !
i think all but one of the funny scenes are in the tv advert for the film .
it 's not a patch on notting hill or bridget jones .
go see kill bill instead - it 's much funnier !
julie , newcastle , uk i enjoyed it a little but was expecting some substance or some sort of plot .
it it was n't for bill nighy i would say it was a waste of time .
i bit over rated i would say .
loved about a boy , excellent film i would see again and again .
this one once was definitely enough ! ! !
maria crossley , england the title says it all - if you do n't want to see sentimental stories then do n't go and see it .
the clear star is martine mccutcheon , and it 's very funny at parts .
i quite enjoyed it , ' cos sometimes all you want to watch is nothing deep , unlike most films coming out with the lead up to the oscars !
anon , wales best thing about it was for the first time in ages i actually liked the prime minister .
take note , tony .
rick , scotland -lrb- living in ireland -rrb- what 's wrong with a bit of good old-fashioned schlock every now and then ?
guy chapman , uk this film is sweet , funny and sometimes quite sad .
you find yourself laughing one minute and then quite tearful the next .
this film would not appeal to everybody and i do think to really to enjoy it you have to be in a good relationship yourself .
marrina , england i think that love actually is the best film i have seen in ages .
i laughed all the way through and at the end of the day i 'd rather laugh than see people beating each other up and killing people .
how depressing is that ?
hugh grant and martine mccutcheon work well together and the rest of the cast are a credit to the film too .
gemma marden , england i did n't like it .
and i normally love soppy and overly sentimental films .
i agree with your reviewer completely - you do n't get to know the characters and therefore do n't care about their situations .
and it just is n't very funny .
there are a few good moments but i was bored mostly .
martine was fabulous though - they should have just made the martine / hugh movie and have been done with it .
-lrb- with emma thompson 's plot as a subplot -rrb- .
humbug !
matt , london i absolutely adored this film , it is remarkably fun and entertaining , which lives up to all the hype .
everyone who leaves the cinema after seeing this film will have a large grin on their face it is such a feel good film .
my only criticism is that the stars really do n't have too much on-screen time , which perhaps is a good thing because you are left wanting more , and are certainly never bored at any point .
i wish i could say that this was an acurate portrayal of life in london , or a true reflection of the experience of love , but i ca n't .
this is quite clearly a work of non fiction , and those who criticise the film for this really are clutching at straws to find flaws with a truly wonderful cinema experience , a must see for all .
gordon , uk surely this is just the right time for some feelgoodness ?
i really enjoyed the film !
but maybe that 's because i 'm a newlywed with a penchant for all things love .
andrea , uk it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye shiona walker , uk i totally agree with your reviewer .
this is a muddled film .
many of the stories fall at the first hurdle and the good ones -lrb- laura linney / brother , emma thompson / alan rickman -rrb- are left unresolved .
there a few good laughs but ultimately the film over long , over simplistic and juggles too many rom coms in the air .
fine for a wet afternoon but this is no notting hill .
glenn meads , uk not as good as notting hill , too many story lines that in two cases leave you less than satisified at the end .
hugh grant & martine mccutcheon do n't feature nearly enough in what could have been a much stronger element to the storyline , bill nighy does indee completely steal the movie .
a fun , but not as memorable watch as those previously penned by richard curtis .
steve , england i saw this last night , and what a lovely film , who cares that it was made up of loads of different scenarios , it 's lighthearted , funny , very entertaining and did exactly what it set out to do - made me smile , laugh and even brought a tear to my eye - am i a softy - yes !
hugh grant does what he does best - is it better than notting hill - by far - bill nighy has to be no 1 for christmas and i hope mr blair watches it and takes note !
it 's a feel good movie and we all need that sometimes .
richard curtis - well done .
shiona walker , uk supremently over-sentimental and laboured - saved only by several very funny-witty moments .
good value , though , for forgettable light entertainment .
dan , uk i am astonished by the critics ' reviews which have accused the film of sickening sentimentality .
at least three of the storylines concentrate on the tragic side of love - balm to all us misanthropes out there , i.e. those of us who are not cocooned in a cuddly relationship -lrb- bah humbug -rrb- .
it was entertaining , well acted , moving and with proper dollops of predictable but appropriate songs in all the right places .
i have n't felt two-and-a-bit hours fly by so effortlessly in the cinema since pirates of the caribbean .
alan simpson , belfast , ni a rom-com without the comedy !
two hours of sentimental drivel .
one for the ladies , i think .
very , very boring !
jim , uk i saw this movie at an advance screening on 16/11/03 and both myself and my partner thought it is the best movie of 2003 .
with so much doom and gloom in the news right now , it was a total breath of fresh air to find something with such a great feel-good factor .
i liked notting hill - but thought that love actually was far , far better .
i shall definitely be seeing it again maxine , uk a rom-com without the comedy ! two hours of sentimental drivel. one for the ladies i think , very , very boring ! jim , uk what a great film - loads of really good performances typical of a curtis production .
hugh grant as the pm was a masterpiece , plus brilliant performance from liam neeson with his on-screen son .
if you liked 4 weddings & notting hill go and see this - it 's even better ... - a perfect christmas film rich , uk for the first 10-15 minutes i thought it was ridiculously over the top and a real disappointment .
i then realised that was the whole point .
once i accepted that , i loved it .
it is the most ' feel good ' feel good movie ever .
emma thompson was fantastic .
not one for the cynics but if you relax and accept a bit of fantasy for an hour and half it will brighten up your week .
judy , uk i thought this film was lovely .
it was nicely pieced together using great actors .
the part with the little boy was so sweet .
no way was it too sentimental .
it was just right .
chanel , wales it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence carl anglim , brit in us i agree that 10 stories are hard to keep sorting out , but i loved the film .
the actors were superb .
i especially liked hugh grant 's prime minister character making his displeasure known over a one-sided relationship with the american president .
believe me , we appreciate our british friends , but we also need friends who stand up to us and tell us the truth , even if its only in a movie .
byron , usa i thought the film was fabtastic .
it is true that some characters and plotlines can get lost , and that it lacks a solid substance , but anyone watching the film , or piece of cinematic art , will find themselves smiling non stop .
it was sincerely refreshing to have a happy feel-good movie at a time when the box office seemed to be flooded with violence and when the world seems to be dealing with so much hate .
i loved the experience and i recommend all to see it , its good for teh heart if nothing else .
carl anglim , brit in usa i loved this film .
it was quite funny in parts and serious in other sections .
however , i can understand why some people may not like it .
it does have a lot of parts and lot of characters .
it may be too sentimental for some but it does have a great cast and some marvelous dialogue .
dave , new jersey brilliant actually !
i enjoyed every minute of this film .
it was touching , soppy , happy escapism , and a welcome relief from our current unsettled reality .
go see it and forget about the angry world for two hours at least .
christine , u.k brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film tom , uk thought it was an ok film however i did think there was a bit too much love , and also the ageing rocker guy really stole the film from hugh grant 's usual performance jake , london , england simply the best film i have seen a long time !
it was superb !
yes , some of the love stories were a little forgotten about at times , and you did have to concentrate a little to follow the links , but with such fantastic acting how could you fail to enjoy it !
and contrary to the criticism levelled at it , the film is not all sweetness and light .
it deals with adultery and loss amongst others .
this film made me laugh , had me on the verge of tears , made me cringe but most of all made me smile , and if we ca n't smile at a christmas film , what can we smile at .
stop being so cynical and enjoy it for what it is - a film about love ! the best of curtis ' films to date !
stephanie mcnaul , northern ireland i really enjoyed the movie , it was a great mixture of brit com .
i thought that the cast was great and i enjoyed the coming together at the end .
i think that the music that linked the stories together was also really well done .
i hope that everyone enjoys this movie as much as me . an actaully loves it !
emily , canada as a brit living in the u.s.a. i am first in line at my local movie theater -lrb- ' cinema ' to the folks back home ! -rrb- whenever a british film is released here .
i am afraid that where " notting hill " had a gooey feelgood effect , " the full monty " a full throttle -lrb- & full frontal ! -rrb- feelgood effect , " love actually " was just cloyingly over-the-top- saccharin that had no effect at all - apart from feeling ' what an -lrb- almost -rrb- total waste of time . '
i say ' almost ' because the only worthwhile bits were observing emma thompson 's undisputable acting ablity & bill nighy hamming it up like a good ' un .
the rest of the movie was a bit of a dead loss , actually .
riki baron , u.s.a. brillant , one of the funniest films this year .
the film assembles most of britains best acting talent - many of which are making movie debuts .
bill nighy is espicially hilarious as has-been popstar billy mack .
great casting , lots of laughs and although slightly chessy , a great meaning behind the film .
merry christmas !
tom , uk i went to see love actually last night with my wife and while she really enjoyed it i felt quite empty as the credits rolled .
what bothered me was a lack of depth to the characters .
they were like bits of people , or characters from other films stuffed together into this one .
it was almost like an episode of friends but without a whole series to get to know and like the people .
ultimately there were some good moments , colin firth was excellent but was also largely unconnected with the rest of the film .
sadly this one will have to go down as a bit of a damp squib .
shane sturrock , uk as well as mccutcheon kris marshall also suffers from a spectacularly underwritten role .
it 's bright , cheery and predictably warm and fuzzy , but not half as sharp or believable as ' four weddings ... '
there 's worse ways to spend a couple of hours during the cold of winter , but surely curtis could have done a lot better this time round with the wealth of talent at his disposal ?
ingmar collinson , uk the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
jonathan harris thought it was a great movie .
a couple of unnecessary story lines but the main ones were quite good .
loved the bit with the pm dancing through 10 downing street .
i was laughing hysterically .
sherry , usa so it is similar to all of the other films but what is wrong with that .
it is a well-acted light hearted , and sometimes very moving look at life and it was a real joy to watch .
all of the actors were playing parts we had seen them do before in other pieces , but bringing them together in one film in a series of inter-related but quite separate plots was quite different .
as you can see , i enjoyed it !
slightly too long and over-drawn in parts but this did not detract from enjoyment .
as for being too sentimental - so what ?
ken sloan , england richard curtis ' formula is starting to get very irritating indeed .
exploiting his audience 's feelings with a cynisicm that gives lie to the supposed ' sentimentalism ' of the film , we have moments of self-plagerism so obvious it insults our intellegence .
we 've all seen ' four weddings ' , so the inclusion of bitter sweet funeral elegies , subtitled miscommunications and revelations of unrequited love are all very tired .
moreover , many of the stories actually remain unresolved , pointing to extremely sloppy editing .
actors such as emma thompson and alan rickman deserve better material than they are given .
over all , a waste of talent on all levels. laura , england love actually is 2 hours of pure sentimentality , delivered by some of the uks finest actors .
i loved it !
and it appears the rest of the packed cinema did also .
richard , maidstone , kent absolutely stunning .
the perfect film .
crushingly romantic , roaringly funny , warm , moving and beautiful .
the cumulative emotional impact of the different stories is devastating .
the ideal date movie .
the ideal christmas movie - move over ' it 's a wonderful life ' .
-lrb- and anyone who criticises it for manipulating the audiences ' emotions ... that is what films are supposed to do -rrb- jonathan morris , uk is it sentimental ?
yes .
does it jump from character to character too fast ?
yes .
did i think it was hysterically funny , and sad , and enjoy it immensely ?
yes !
sue whitfield , england its a feel-good film but just a bit over-the-top with its sugary sentimentality .
i saw it in the last states just before its release in the uk and the audition just loved it -lrb- do us brits so continually use the f-word in every sentence ? -rrb- .
the film gets you in the christmas mood but the music is more enjoyable than the storylines .
trish broadley , east grinstead , uk a piece of fluff which was quite inane : to imagine hugh grant as the p.m. falling in love with the tea lady is beyond comprehension -lrb- even in fantasy ! -rrb- .
also , colin firth supposedly falling for a person with whom he could not communnicate stretches one 's imagination even further !
the only word to describe the film is silly ! ! christine tomchak , canada i really enjoyed the ideas behind some of the storylines- the temptation of alan rickman , and emma thomson 's tortuous but dignified reaction .
the idea of the relationship of a career woman being scuppered by her love for her ill brother was also very thought-provoking , but neither of these storylines were adequately probed .
instead , we had a skimming of some fairly feeble and predictable plots , and most of which were already ruined by the advert .
do they get together ?
well they already are in the commercial .
why do they do that ?
the funniest scenes were also ruined in this way .
richard curtis can be side-splittingly funny , but this was just really too sentimental , although easily watchable .
lucy , uk sweet overdose is right .
i pity any diabetics in the audience .
robert del valle , usa for goodness sake stop analysing it and just enjoy it ! !
i saw it during the previews last sunday and loved it , in fact i am going tomorrow to see it again .
i do n't know anyone who has seen it that does n't love it .
liz , uk -lrb- wales -rrb- i totally disagree with the review above - love actually is hilarious , i cried and laughed at the same time .
i left feeling good and would go and see it again .
i think you will find that love actually is brilliant . and sometimes in a world that we live in we forget the one thing that keeps us together .

julie hogg , 22 , from billingham , teesside , went missing in 1989 and her body was eventually found behind her bath panel by her mother ann ming .
her boyfriend , billy dunlop , was charged with her murder but juries at two trials failed to reach a verdict and he was acquitted .

the change in the double jeopardy ruling has been included in the new criminal justice act which received royal assent on friday .
ann ming hopes a change in the rule will help her daughter 's case mrs ming said she hoped the law would be implemented retrospectively .

mrs ming said : " the end is hopefully in sight ... we have n't got everything -lsb- we want -rsb- because he has not been charged yet with julie 's murder , which is what we want .
