fischer reaffirms german position to the un current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2003 germany 's u.n. ambassador : we are ready for the challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter plueger : ready for his mandate this week germany joined the u.n. security council as a non-permanent member for the fourth time .
preparations in both berlin and new york are well under way before the council 's first meetings start next week . on jan .
1 , germany joined the united nations security council as a temporary member for two years .
it is the fourth time that germany has been invited to join , following periods in 1977-78 , 1987-88 and 1995-96 . prior to the start of the new term , german ambassador to the u.n. günther pleuger sat down for talks with fellow european members and prepared intensively for the new challenges that will await him in the next two years . " we have put together a team for the security council which will be led by the head of the politics department .
in the politics department , various people are responsible for regional conflicts and thematic discussions which are held in the security council , " pleuger said . starting next week , the council will meet for a daily meeting at u.n. headquarters in new york , just across the road from the german permanent mission to the u.n. in february , germany will take over the council 's rotating presidency for one month , a step which pleuger hopes will boost german influence in the council . " we are , of course , also representing german interests in the united nations .
however , in the council , which consists of only 15 of the 191 states in the u.n. , one must bear in the mind the interests of the united nations as a whole .
the security council sees itself as one committee which acts in the interests of all members in the u.n .. " iraq dominates agenda as the question of a possible war against iraq becomes more imminent , this issue is due to dominate the coming months both on the international agenda , but also within u.n. ranks .
the most contentious question linked to germany 's security council membership is whether berlin will let its ambassador decide on the issue or make him abstain from the vote .
for pleuger , however , there are more pressing questions to be answered . " first , germany will not hide itself and , second , it is still not clear whether the council will get together on the basis of the resolution 1441and , if so , which decision will eventually be made. he most important thing at the moment is to support the weapons inspectors ' mission to disarm iraq in a peaceful way and to help it to succeed . " however , the issue is due to become more contentious for germany , in particular due to its presidency of the iraq sanctions committee , which it takes over next week .
according to pleuger , both berlin and the german mission in new york have stepped up on communication and cooperation in preparation for this step . " we have an excellently functioning information and coordination system with the headquarters in berlin , " he said . " and of course i can , if necessary , ring foreign minister joschka fischer for the appropriate political instructions for a vote in the security council or for a difficult statement . " changing coalitions a further stumbling block could prove to be the coalitions in the security council , which change regularly with the various topics and interests .
germany 's ambassador will try to work closely with the other european countries including france , great britain and spain , but will avoid forming a block which could offend berlin 's other allies . " most of the members of the u.n. are our friends , " pleuger explained . " the majority of the members , namely 182 of 191 states , voted for us to join the security council .

preparations in both berlin and new york are well under way before the council 's first meetings start next week . on jan .
1 , germany joined the united nations security council as a temporary member for two years .
it is the fourth time that germany has been invited to join , following periods in 1977-78 , 1987-88 and 1995-96 . prior to the start of the new term , german ambassador to the u.n. günther pleuger sat down for talks with fellow european members and prepared intensively for the new challenges that will await him in the next two years . " we have put together a team for the security council which will be led by the head of the politics department .
in the politics department , various people are responsible for regional conflicts and thematic discussions which are held in the security council , " pleuger said . starting next week , the council will meet for a daily meeting at u.n. headquarters in new york , just across the road from the german permanent mission to the u.n. in february , germany will take over the council 's rotating presidency for one month , a step which pleuger hopes will boost german influence in the council . " we are , of course , also representing german interests in the united nations .
however , in the council , which consists of only 15 of the 191 states in the u.n. , one must bear in the mind the interests of the united nations as a whole .
the security council sees itself as one committee which acts in the interests of all members in the u.n .. " iraq dominates agenda as the question of a possible war against iraq becomes more imminent , this issue is due to dominate the coming months both on the international agenda , but also within u.n. ranks .
the most contentious question linked to germany 's security council membership is whether berlin will let its ambassador decide on the issue or make him abstain from the vote .
for pleuger , however , there are more pressing questions to be answered . " first , germany will not hide itself and , second , it is still not clear whether the council will get together on the basis of the resolution 1441and , if so , which decision will eventually be made. he most important thing at the moment is to support the weapons inspectors ' mission to disarm iraq in a peaceful way and to help it to succeed . " however , the issue is due to become more contentious for germany , in particular due to its presidency of the iraq sanctions committee , which it takes over next week .
according to pleuger , both berlin and the german mission in new york have stepped up on communication and cooperation in preparation for this step . " we have an excellently functioning information and coordination system with the headquarters in berlin , " he said . " and of course i can , if necessary , ring foreign minister joschka fischer for the appropriate political instructions for a vote in the security council or for a difficult statement . " changing coalitions a further stumbling block could prove to be the coalitions in the security council , which change regularly with the various topics and interests .
germany 's ambassador will try to work closely with the other european countries including france , great britain and spain , but will avoid forming a block which could offend berlin 's other allies . " most of the members of the u.n. are our friends , " pleuger explained . " the majority of the members , namely 182 of 191 states , voted for us to join the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany , iraq and the united nations germany faces difficult year at u.n. fischer mends fences on u.s. trip are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
fischer reaffirms german position to the un current affairs -pipe- 03.01.2003 germany 's u.n. ambassador : we are ready for the challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter plueger : ready for his mandate this week germany joined the u.n. security council as a non-permanent member for the fourth time .
preparations in both berlin and new york are well under way before the council 's first meetings start next week . on jan .
1 , germany joined the united nations security council as a temporary member for two years .
it is the fourth time that germany has been invited to join , following periods in 1977-78 , 1987-88 and 1995-96 . prior to the start of the new term , german ambassador to the u.n. günther pleuger sat down for talks with fellow european members and prepared intensively for the new challenges that will await him in the next two years . " we have put together a team for the security council which will be led by the head of the politics department .
in the politics department , various people are responsible for regional conflicts and thematic discussions which are held in the security council , " pleuger said . starting next week , the council will meet for a daily meeting at u.n. headquarters in new york , just across the road from the german permanent mission to the u.n. in february , germany will take over the council 's rotating presidency for one month , a step which pleuger hopes will boost german influence in the council . " we are , of course , also representing german interests in the united nations .
however , in the council , which consists of only 15 of the 191 states in the u.n. , one must bear in the mind the interests of the united nations as a whole .
the security council sees itself as one committee which acts in the interests of all members in the u.n .. " iraq dominates agenda as the question of a possible war against iraq becomes more imminent , this issue is due to dominate the coming months both on the international agenda , but also within u.n. ranks .
the most contentious question linked to germany 's security council membership is whether berlin will let its ambassador decide on the issue or make him abstain from the vote .
for pleuger , however , there are more pressing questions to be answered . " first , germany will not hide itself and , second , it is still not clear whether the council will get together on the basis of the resolution 1441and , if so , which decision will eventually be made. he most important thing at the moment is to support the weapons inspectors ' mission to disarm iraq in a peaceful way and to help it to succeed . " however , the issue is due to become more contentious for germany , in particular due to its presidency of the iraq sanctions committee , which it takes over next week .
according to pleuger , both berlin and the german mission in new york have stepped up on communication and cooperation in preparation for this step . " we have an excellently functioning information and coordination system with the headquarters in berlin , " he said . " and of course i can , if necessary , ring foreign minister joschka fischer for the appropriate political instructions for a vote in the security council or for a difficult statement . " changing coalitions a further stumbling block could prove to be the coalitions in the security council , which change regularly with the various topics and interests .
germany 's ambassador will try to work closely with the other european countries including france , great britain and spain , but will avoid forming a block which could offend berlin 's other allies . " most of the members of the u.n. are our friends , " pleuger explained . " the majority of the members , namely 182 of 191 states , voted for us to join the security council .
that is a sign of trust in germany 's ability to take on this responsibility , which we are now doing for the fourth time . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de profile : berlin ’ s man at the un gunter pleuger , germany 's new ambassador to the united nations , is an expert on both u.n. issues and on negotiating .
his skills may be put to the test when germany becomes a member of the security council for two years .

31 , 02 -rrb- are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

germany 's ambassador will try to work closely with the other european countries including france , great britain and spain , but will avoid forming a block which could offend berlin 's other allies .

" the north korean nuclear issue is the biggest problem as it may check the economic growth -lrb- of south korea -rrb- , " said the central bank 's governor park seung .
the bank of korea 's growth target of 5.7 % would be threatened if tensions escalated too far and the economy could even contract .
in december , north korea reactivated its plutonium-based nuclear program , under the auspices of power generation , after the us stopped oil shipments to the country .
the us claims north korea - which has no domestic crude oil supplies - is really using the reactors to arm nuclear weapons .
no rate cut a war with iraq , which has fuelled a sharp rise in oil prices , and the weak global economy are the other risks in 2003 , said mr park .
despite the uncertainty , a interest rate cut was not in the offing , he added .
the bank 's board left rates near record lows at 4.25 % in december and will meet again next thursday .
surging oil prices pushed south korea 's imports to a record high in december , cutting the trade surplus to $ 704m from $ 1.2b in november , the commerce ministry said on wednesday .
south korea , like its northern neighbour , also imports all of its crude supplies .
in 2002 , the trade surplus reached $ 10.8bn from $ 9.3bn in the previous year fuelled by the hi-tech and automotive sectors and strong demand from china .
more warnings the central bank warning echoes those of the commercial banking sector .
" operational difficulties are growing bigger , " said kim jung-tae , the chief executive of south korea 's biggest lender , kookmin , in a new year 's message .
the growth threat of war has led companies to shelve or cut investment plans and could scare of foreign investors .
" the environment for operation will be more tough because of growing uncertainties , " said ra eung-chan , chief of shinhan finance , the country 's fourth largest lender .
the economy is already projected to grow more slowly in 2003 than last year 's 6.2 % .

the value of uk pensions has fallen for the third year in a row , according to an investment information group .
despite some recovery in equity markets in the final quarter of the year , 2002 was a major disappointment for uk pensions funds alan wilcock , russell / mellon caps russell / mellon caps suggested that funds declined in value by around 11.3 % in 2002 , following a fall of 8.9 % in 2001 and 1 % in 2000 .
the group said this was the first time the value of pension funds had fallen for three consecutive years since records began .
uk pensions in crisis key pension facts and figures at a glance in pictures russell / mellon attributes the decline to the sharp falls on the stock market , not just in the uk but across the world .
a bad run russell / mellon analyses and compares different pension funds .
it said the three year period to december 2002 was the worst period for returns on pension funds since the mid-1970s .
however , on a more positive note , it said the average return when looking at the past 10 years was a more positive 7.5 % .
alan wilcock , research and development director at russell / mellon said : " despite some recovery in equity markets in the final quarter of the year , 2002 was a major disappointment for uk pensions funds .
" the situation was compounded by the negative results in both 2000 and 2001 . "
more gloom ahead mr wilcock 's negative view is shared by watson wyatt , a firm of consultants which warned yesterday that there could be more bad news ahead .
the group said 2003 could see the end of more company final salary pension schemes .
it suggested a number of the schemes - which were traditionally viewed as the best type of pension - could be closed to new entrants or wound up altogether .
it blamed a £ 70bn black hole in pension funds caused by the stock market falls and advised pension funds to invest in property rather than shares .

office costs in the uk are the highest in the world , led by london 's west end , according to a property consultancy .
dtz , an international property group , said the capital occupied the top two spots for the price of office space , with london 's west end followed by the financial district , the city .
steep rises elsewhere in the uk made edinburgh and birmingham more expensive than new york or hong kong .
dtz said that despite falling occupancy across the world , office space was still becoming an increasingly expensive commodity .
costly floor space the property firm looked at rental values in 44 countries during 2002 to compile its ' top 10 ' of most expensive locations .
office costs £ / sq.ft london west end £ 91 london city £ 73 tokyo £ 57 paris £ 50 edinburgh £ 41 birmingham £ 40 new york city £ 39 moscow £ 38 hong kong £ 36 manchester £ 36 it suggested the average office in the west end of london would cost a business £ 91 -lrb- $ 145 -rrb- per square foot per month , and £ 73 in the city .
in third place was tokyo , although with a substantially cheaper average price tag of £ 57 per square foot .
dtz said the us had seen a " market decline in occupancy costs " during 2002 , largely because of the falling value of the dollar .
only new york made it into the list of 10 most expensive office areas , in seventh place .
falling trend ?
however , dtz suggested that a number of property costs had fallen during 2002 as business strength weakened globally .
average office costs fell by 3 % in western europe , by 6 % in north america and by 1 % in asia-pacific .
the company 's survey came as property group hammerson announced it had entered into a joint venture with axa to redevelop key properties in paris .
the scheme will involve the creation of 26,000 square metres of prime new office space on place vendome , a listed facade .
paris came in fourth on dtz 's survey , with an average cost per square foot of £ 50 .

walking down regent street in cambridge i noticed a young man ask the woman he was with to stand still for a moment while he snapped her with his ericsson t68i .
since it was the first time i had actually seen a phone used to take a photo , apart from the various demonstrations given to me by my more geeky friends , i went up to him and asked him what he thought of the camera and whether he thought it would catch on .
" do n't know , " he replied , " i just bought the phone and was playing around . "
so much for the latest trend .
capturing the mood most manufacturers offer camera phones now since then i have seen a phone camera used two other times .
a parent at my daughter 's school carol concert was snapping with her nokia 7650 .
my friend simon takes every opportunity he can to show off the features of his orange spv phone , but he is hardly typical of the target market for this new toy .
there is a lot of scepticism about the likely success of camera phones , partly prompted by the over-the-top advertising for the services , which seems to resemble the hype over wap .
wap promised much by overstating things like ease of use and picture quality , while ignoring things like the cost or lack of compatibility of the services across networks .
yet despite the current uncertainties and inadequacies , i think camera phones will catch on and rather rapidly .
they will be used by all sorts of businesses , from tree surgeons to roofing contractors , and no estate agent or used car sales person will be without one .
by the end of the year they will be pretty ubiquitous in many work settings .
they will also be used more creatively , by teenage girls consulting friends about which boys they should dance with at the disco .
dedicated shoppers will use them to ask advice on anything from underwear to which heal 's sofa to buy , and fans will snap celebrities in the street .
spying on each other however they will have other , less innocuous uses .
as a recent contributor to the bbc message board pointed out , we will quickly see conversations like this one : will we like where our pictures end up ?
daughter : " mum , i 'm sleeping over at sophie 's tonight " .
mum : " show me a picture " .
while this may sound defensible , what about having to provide picture evidence of your red nose and bleary eyes when you call in sick , or a photo of your mates to your partner when you go out for an evening without them .
even having your photograph taken every time you buy alcohol .
click here to tell us what you would like bill to write about we are already filmed using cash machines , so why not every time we enter a shop ?
if you want to see the future , then look at easycar .
the rental company insists that all uk customers are photographed with a webcam when they rent a car .
in october it started publishing the names and photographs of customers whose cars were over 15 days overdue on its website .
at the moment the site has no pictures , but search for easycar overdue cars and the google cache happily reveals details of one such customer , who , it seems , has now returned his vehicle .
the people named and shamed on this site have not broken any law .
they are not accused of a crime .
they are simply people who have kept a car longer than they said they would .
the impact on our personal privacy has not been discussed at all , yet the technology is coming whether or not we consider what it mean since easycar insists on having credit card details from these people there is no indication that they are not willing or able to pay any overdue amount .
easycar has a contract with the people who rent its cars .
what it is doing is not unlawful , it is just unethical and , to my mind , remarkably intrusive .
this policy means i will never rent from them but that probably does not bother them .
however it is also a pointer to a future in which visual records are increasingly available online , and this has some frightening implications .
we will soon be surrounded by millions of picture phones , all with internet connectivity and the ability to send photos via e-mail , or upload them to websites .
the impact on our personal privacy has not been discussed at all , yet the technology is coming whether or not we consider what it means .
privacy concerns what about the photo of you in a cafe with someone you should n't be seeing that ends your relationship soon there will be photographs of me , perhaps taken without my knowledge , on websites all over the net .
this may not seem to matter much , until someone clever in a research lab figures out how to do image matching and creates a new search engine that will trawl the entire net for photos of this face .
how will i feel when anyone who is curious can find the photos on this site , the pictures where i am in the background , and all the other many appearances my bearded , hairy face makes online ?
how will you feel when it happens to you ?
if personal privacy means anything , it means being able to go about one 's business unobserved .
cctv systems in city centres impinge on this , but they are at least regulated and controlled by local authorities .
if the newspapers publish photos of you then you can complain or sue .
but what about the pictures of you drinking too much that appear on your friends ' website and get you into trouble at work ?
what about the photo of you in a cafe with someone you should n't be seeing that ends your relationship ?
regrettable shift what about the snap that shows you asking for directions from a stranger , when that stranger turns out to be a terrorist suspect and you end up being questioned ?
some technologies change the world in ways that were never imagined when they were first created or sold .
the telephone , originally thought of as a way of delivering news and concerts to large numbers of people , transformed business .
the internet , a research network for computer scientists , made large-scale publishing at very low cost possible .
the combination of easy web publishing with picture phones could mark a decisive shift in our approach to personal privacy , a shift that we may end up regretting .
what do you think of camera phones ?
this is what you had to say : i do n't understand this obsession with privacy .
if you are in a public place , nothing you are doing is private as such - it is all open to passing inspection .
unless you have something to hide why would you be worried about a more permanent record of your public activities ?
jon , uk why do you suggest this trend in technology is undesirable ?
the more surveillance the better .
if , from time to time , someone not implicated at that instance is turned over by the authorities - so what ?
tom , australia i agree with bill that phone / cameras are potentially threatening to personal privacy .
but , as bill points out , this is just an extension of the intrusion of technology into our lives that seems unavoidable .
some modification to privacy legislation is needed to take into account this new technology .
gary heath , britain -lrb- resident in taiwan -rrb- local papers already publish photos of thieves taken by cameras in shops and news reports of drunk drivers .
in the us some pro-life groups plan to film people going into clinics to publish .
the idea is to name and shame .
i see no reason to be concerned about photos of people doing anti-social things like being drunk in the street and threatening behaviour .
surely this is not a problem if the same thing extends to the internet ?
our photos pop up all over the place .
the street is a public place after all and you can be photographed there without restriction .
this is surely a basic freedom .
steve vogt , uk i can virtually guarantee that this will be the next big thing .
people love gimmicky things like this , but like many new technologies they will be hail and used in mass , with little consequence to it being overtly intrusive .
millions of e-mail / text message etc are sent each day will little regard to who 's snooping .
the same will happen will photo messaging .
the big companies will make there fortunes , but ultimately our privacy will be jeopardised .
but of course it was your choice to send the message in the first place , big business just provide the technology .
pete , uk while some of the fears about having one 's photo put about the internet without one 's knowledge are , perhaps , justifiable , who 's to say that has n't already happened without your knowledge ?
how about the holiday snaps where you 're in someone else 's photo ?
as for being asked for a photo as proof that i 'm truly ill , i would have no problem with that so long as i was telling the truth .
anyone pulling a sickie would be caught out , which is fair enough .
if i suspected my husband was cheating on me , i 'd be so grateful for these phones now .
it 's a brilliant way to get proof that your husband is meeting up with the ex behind your back , when they promised not to .
i 'd rather end a relationship like that , than remain in the dark and carry on like fool .
susan , uk with all new technology there will be a downside , but with camera phones i think there are many benefits .
i think crime or crimefighting will benefit a lot , for example you see someone acting suspiciously outside a school or see a car speed away from a bank .

walking down regent street in cambridge i noticed a young man ask the woman he was with to stand still for a moment while he snapped her with his ericsson t68i .
since it was the first time i had actually seen a phone used to take a photo , apart from the various demonstrations given to me by my more geeky friends , i went up to him and asked him what he thought of the camera and whether he thought it would catch on .
" do n't know , " he replied , " i just bought the phone and was playing around . "
so much for the latest trend .
capturing the mood since then i have seen a phone camera used two other times .
a parent at my daughter 's school carol concert was snapping with her nokia 7650 .
my friend simon takes every opportunity he can to show off the features of his orange spv phone , but he is hardly typical of the target market for this new toy .
there is a lot of scepticism about the likely success of camera phones , partly prompted by the over-the-top advertising for the services , which seems to resemble the hype over wap .
wap promised much by overstating things like ease of use and picture quality , while ignoring things like the cost or lack of compatibility of the services across networks .
yet despite the current uncertainties and inadequacies , i think camera phones will catch on and rather rapidly .
they will be used by all sorts of businesses , from tree surgeons to roofing contractors , and no estate agent or used car sales person will be without one .

as with his earlier talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak , the middle east peace process and tensions over iraq were on the agenda on thursday .
king abudullah is among those arab leaders warning against any war on iraq .
mr blair and his wife , cherie , met the king and queen rania for a private dinner at the royal residence in the jordanian port aqaba .
on thursday , us president george bush warned saddam hussein that his " day of reckoning " was coming .
mr bush said he was " hopeful we wo n't have to go to war " but repeated that he doubted iraq 's willingness to disarm .
gloomy message earlier , iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz accused america of " imperialist designs " and said it was preparing to invade to seize control of iraq 's oil resources the blairs have been holidaying in the red sea holiday resort of sharm el-sheikh .
the uk prime minister held two hours of talks at a private dinner in the resort with president mubarak on wednesday .
middle east peace was on the agenda for the talks with mubarak the meetings come after mr blair 's gloomy new year forecast about threats to britain from international terrorism and the troubled world economy .
that message drew criticism from the conservatives , who accused mr blair of trying to divert attention from domestic problems .
in one of his most downbeat annual bulletins , mr blair cited iraq , al-qaeda , the middle east and north korea as concerns which would exacerbate problems in faltering world markets .
distraction ?
but the deputy leader of the conservative party , michael ancram , said voters were more interested in labour 's " failure to deliver " on the domestic front .
these included " crises " in the health service , schools , law and order and pensions , he said .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy urged mr blair to ensure un inspectors had time to establish the truth about iraq 's weapons programmes , before taking any decision on military action .
he also urged him to " pay more attention to what is happening here at home " .
earlier this week , labour veteran lord healey warned mr blair against repeating the " disastrous " decision of tory prime minister sir anthony eden , who went to war in the middle east over suez in 1956 , at a time of similar international tension .
