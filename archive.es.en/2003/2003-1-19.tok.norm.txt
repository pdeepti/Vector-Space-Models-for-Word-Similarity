" persuasive evidence " that president saddam hussein has nuclear , biological or chemicals weapons may be enough to warrant military strikes by britain and the us , he told the sunday telegraph .
we believe that the right thing to follow would be a further security council resolution defence secretary geoff hoon it is expected mr hoon will announce as early as monday he is putting 14,000 troops on stand-by for operations in the gulf , said the paper .
his reported comments came the day after thousands of people across the uk joined in a show of opposition in 18 countries to an impending war with iraq .
' prohibited finds ' the defence secretary said : " clearly we believe there are weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
" we would expect hans blix -lsb- chief un weapons inspector -rsb- and his team to discover indications of them - a shell or a missile or something clearly prohibited , or documentary evidence , " he said .
mr hoon believes iraq has prohibited weapons mr hoon told the paper inspectors may interview someone who had been working on these programmes who might explain what has been going on .
" it 's not literally a smoking gun .
" it is persuasive evidence that confirms what we believe to be the case - that there are weapons of mass destruction in iraq . "
on saturday the united nations atomic agency voiced concerns about documents apparently relating to nuclear technology found in an iraqi scientist 's home but said it was too soon to say what the documents were for certain .
one of the scientists has categorically denied any link between the documents and iraq 's former nuclear weapons programme .
mobilisation meanwhile up to 14,000 uk troops , with around 150 challenger 2 battle tanks from the 7th armoured brigade are being placed on standby ready to move , said the sunday telegraph .
mr hoon acknowledged " anxieties " within the country about a possible war against iraq , and said britain would try to gain a fresh resolution of the united nations security council before military strikes were launched .
" we believe that the right thing to follow would be a further security council resolution - that is what we will work to achieve , " he said .
dr blix , who met prime minister tony blair on friday to update him on the team 's progress , is due to report to the un security council in new york on 27 january .
mr blair has said he is confident of turning the tide of public opinion in britain if war with iraq becomes necessary .

no group has admitted responsibility for the brutal massacre .
the attackers terrorised villagers in the middle of the night the zone where the killings took place is a battle front , where three of the country 's warring factions are fighting for territorial control .
the atrocity occurred when an armed group arrived in the hamlets around san carlos in the middle of the night .
they began to drag people from their homes , killing them on their porches .
among the dead was a man aged over 70 , four women and three children .
two of the murdered women were pregnant .
when troops arrived in the zone , they found bodies strewn around the hamlets .
two of the victims were still clinging to life and were taken by helicopter to hospital .
violence imitated the killings have all the hallmarks of the right-wing paramilitaries , which made the massacre of suspected guerrilla sympathisers one of their principal strategies to cleanse areas of rebel support .
but recently the guerrillas of the largest rebel group , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , have begun imitating this brutal tactic .
security forces have indicated they think the guerrillas were responsible for this latest atrocity .
authorities cite the fact that earlier in the week farc guerrillas opened fire on a bus passing san carlos , killing four people , one of them a child .
this area in eastern antioquia has long been a front line in the 39-year civil conflict , with illegal armies of the left and right wings fighting for territorial control .
news of the massacre has come as a blow to the government of president alvaro uribe , who was elected on the back of his promise to provide democratic security and protect colombians .
but his tough stance has simply provoked the marxist guerrillas to new levels of violence .

in an interview with newsweek magazine , he said he was only ready to accept the concept of a palestinian state provided that israel controlled its external borders .
quartet plan phase 1 -lrb- 2003 -rrb- : palestinian elections , security reform , israel pull back , humanitarian initiatives , security agreement phase 2 : palestinian state created phase 3 -lrb- 2004-2005 -rrb- : israeli-palestinian negotiations on permanent status solution mr sharon again stressed that he wanted palestinian leader yasser arafat removed from any position of influence .
israel has a general election scheduled for 28 january , when mr sharon 's likud will be challenged by labour , whose leader amram mitzna favours immediate talks with the palestinians .
mr sharon has adopted a hard line , demanding a full cessation of violence before any moves towards peace with the palestinians .
plan is ' nothing ' he told newsweek magazine that he discounted a " road map " resolution envisaging the creation of a palestinian state within three years .
sharon 's demands yasser arafat to be removed from influence palestinian prime minister to be appointed reforms to be undertaken , mostly in palestinian security organisations that plan has been pushed by the so-called quartet of the united nations , european union , united states and russia .
but mr sharon said : " the quartet is nothing !
do n't take it seriously . "
there was another plan that might work , but it had to start with the removal of mr arafat , he told the magazine .
if that happened and was followed by other changes , mr sharon said he would consider moves towards a palestinian state .
he told newsweek : " i am ready , if they have taken steps against terror , to recognise a fully demilitarised palestinian state without final borders - having only police equipped with light weapons .
" israel will control the external borders and will have the right to fly over the territory . "
then , if there was " no terror whatsoever " , a final decision on borders could be taken , he said .
mr mitzna told the same magazine that polls indicated that most israelis backed his initiative for talks or a unilateral separation - such as a border fence - by israel if negotiations failed .
but he accepted the same polls showed that voters still backed likud .
