2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .
foreign policy experts are also underscoring the importance of powell ’ s visit at such a sensitive time .
james lindsay , a member of the national security council under former president clinton and a member of the independent think-tank brookings institution told the financial times deutschland germany should support the u.s. in the security council when it comes to lifting the sanctions on iraq and should avoid criticizing u.s. policies in iraq " just the fact that we ’ re treating this visit as big news shows how bad the situation is , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .

2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the powell visit schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? current affairs -pipe- 30.04.2003 opinion : has the transatlantic ice age ended ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four iraq war opponents surprised observers with their conciliatory tones .
the leaders of germany , france , belgium and luxembourg meet in brussels to talk about strengthening eu defense policy .
the result is an offer for reconciliation with the united states in the wake of dissonance over iraq . mini summit , truffle summit , rebel summit and anti-american summit - germany , france , belgium and luxembourg were subject to copious criticism in the run-up to their meeting in brussels on tuesday to discuss european union defense policy . but the participants have only themselves to blame given that the two-hour conference was only attended by the eu countries that headed up the european anti-war front against the recent u.s. military operations in iraq .
neither greece , which currently holds the eu rotating presidency , nor eu chief diplomat javier solana , who is responsible for the union 's foreign and security policies , went to brussels - not to mention britain , the most important military power in the current 15-member alliance .
to general astonishment belgium , germany , france and luxembourg 's unilateralism did not emerge as an anti-american demonstration or alienate the rest of the eu club .
instead the four heads of state actually managed to give european security and defense policy - which has been going nowhere for some time - a new impetus . rejuvenation the suggestions include creating an eu military headquarters to lead the union 's rapid reaction force , to improve air transport capacities and to establish effective protection against nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
european union member states are meant to carry out the changes in cooperation in order to share tight military resources and budgets and ultimately become more powerful as an alliance .
the suggestions are n't new ; they have been issues for some time in nato and in the european security and defense union , the eu counterpart to the north atlantic military alliance , though little has been done so far .
but after the iraq war , it seems that the four european statesmen are anxious to put the pedal to the metal . we will have to wait and see whether joint military armament will actually be a success , but doubt is already warranted , since the states ' defense budgets are scarcely able to meet current needs . mending ties what was more important about this summit , however , was the political message that gerhard schröder , jacques chirac , guy verhofstadt and jean-claude juncker unanimously relayed : transatlantic relations are indispensable .
chancellor schröder brought it to the point : " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe . "
on top of that , the suggestions to strengthen military ties and cooperation within the union are open to all other eu states , including britain , spain and italy - the main european advocates for the war against iraq - in particular . those are quite a few results for a two-hour meeting .
they included a glimmer of hope that the dissonance - or , more accurately , the ice age in europe as a result of the iraq war - will end soon and they are also an offer of reconciliation to the united states . gerda meuer is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " anti-war " summit backs stronger euro military european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.04.2003 powell to visit germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell , left , and german chancellor schröder in berlin in dec .
2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .

schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.04.2003 powell to visit germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell , left , and german chancellor schröder in berlin in dec .
2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .
foreign policy experts are also underscoring the importance of powell ’ s visit at such a sensitive time .

2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .

the leaders of germany , france , belgium and luxembourg meet in brussels to talk about strengthening eu defense policy .
the result is an offer for reconciliation with the united states in the wake of dissonance over iraq . mini summit , truffle summit , rebel summit and anti-american summit - germany , france , belgium and luxembourg were subject to copious criticism in the run-up to their meeting in brussels on tuesday to discuss european union defense policy . but the participants have only themselves to blame given that the two-hour conference was only attended by the eu countries that headed up the european anti-war front against the recent u.s. military operations in iraq .
neither greece , which currently holds the eu rotating presidency , nor eu chief diplomat javier solana , who is responsible for the union 's foreign and security policies , went to brussels - not to mention britain , the most important military power in the current 15-member alliance .
to general astonishment belgium , germany , france and luxembourg 's unilateralism did not emerge as an anti-american demonstration or alienate the rest of the eu club .
instead the four heads of state actually managed to give european security and defense policy - which has been going nowhere for some time - a new impetus . rejuvenation the suggestions include creating an eu military headquarters to lead the union 's rapid reaction force , to improve air transport capacities and to establish effective protection against nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
european union member states are meant to carry out the changes in cooperation in order to share tight military resources and budgets and ultimately become more powerful as an alliance .
the suggestions are n't new ; they have been issues for some time in nato and in the european security and defense union , the eu counterpart to the north atlantic military alliance , though little has been done so far .
but after the iraq war , it seems that the four european statesmen are anxious to put the pedal to the metal . we will have to wait and see whether joint military armament will actually be a success , but doubt is already warranted , since the states ' defense budgets are scarcely able to meet current needs . mending ties what was more important about this summit , however , was the political message that gerhard schröder , jacques chirac , guy verhofstadt and jean-claude juncker unanimously relayed : transatlantic relations are indispensable .
chancellor schröder brought it to the point : " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe . "

2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .
foreign policy experts are also underscoring the importance of powell ’ s visit at such a sensitive time .
james lindsay , a member of the national security council under former president clinton and a member of the independent think-tank brookings institution told the financial times deutschland germany should support the u.s. in the security council when it comes to lifting the sanctions on iraq and should avoid criticizing u.s. policies in iraq " just the fact that we ’ re treating this visit as big news shows how bad the situation is , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .

u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .
foreign policy experts are also underscoring the importance of powell ’ s visit at such a sensitive time .
james lindsay , a member of the national security council under former president clinton and a member of the independent think-tank brookings institution told the financial times deutschland germany should support the u.s. in the security council when it comes to lifting the sanctions on iraq and should avoid criticizing u.s. policies in iraq " just the fact that we ’ re treating this visit as big news shows how bad the situation is , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .

the leaders of germany , france , belgium and luxembourg meet in brussels to talk about strengthening eu defense policy .

neither greece , which currently holds the eu rotating presidency , nor eu chief diplomat javier solana , who is responsible for the union 's foreign and security policies , went to brussels - not to mention britain , the most important military power in the current 15-member alliance .

neither greece , which currently holds the eu rotating presidency , nor eu chief diplomat javier solana , who is responsible for the union 's foreign and security policies , went to brussels - not to mention britain , the most important military power in the current 15-member alliance .
to general astonishment belgium , germany , france and luxembourg 's unilateralism did not emerge as an anti-american demonstration or alienate the rest of the eu club .
instead the four heads of state actually managed to give european security and defense policy - which has been going nowhere for some time - a new impetus . rejuvenation the suggestions include creating an eu military headquarters to lead the union 's rapid reaction force , to improve air transport capacities and to establish effective protection against nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
european union member states are meant to carry out the changes in cooperation in order to share tight military resources and budgets and ultimately become more powerful as an alliance .
the suggestions are n't new ; they have been issues for some time in nato and in the european security and defense union , the eu counterpart to the north atlantic military alliance , though little has been done so far .
but after the iraq war , it seems that the four european statesmen are anxious to put the pedal to the metal . we will have to wait and see whether joint military armament will actually be a success , but doubt is already warranted , since the states ' defense budgets are scarcely able to meet current needs . mending ties what was more important about this summit , however , was the political message that gerhard schröder , jacques chirac , guy verhofstadt and jean-claude juncker unanimously relayed : transatlantic relations are indispensable .
chancellor schröder brought it to the point : " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe . "
on top of that , the suggestions to strengthen military ties and cooperation within the union are open to all other eu states , including britain , spain and italy - the main european advocates for the war against iraq - in particular . those are quite a few results for a two-hour meeting .
they included a glimmer of hope that the dissonance - or , more accurately , the ice age in europe as a result of the iraq war - will end soon and they are also an offer of reconciliation to the united states . gerda meuer is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " anti-war " summit backs stronger euro military european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance .

2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .

james lindsay , a member of the national security council under former president clinton and a member of the independent think-tank brookings institution told the financial times deutschland germany should support the u.s. in the security council when it comes to lifting the sanctions on iraq and should avoid criticizing u.s. policies in iraq " just the fact that we ’ re treating this visit as big news shows how bad the situation is , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .

schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .

" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .

the leaders of germany , france , belgium and luxembourg meet in brussels to talk about strengthening eu defense policy .
the result is an offer for reconciliation with the united states in the wake of dissonance over iraq . mini summit , truffle summit , rebel summit and anti-american summit - germany , france , belgium and luxembourg were subject to copious criticism in the run-up to their meeting in brussels on tuesday to discuss european union defense policy . but the participants have only themselves to blame given that the two-hour conference was only attended by the eu countries that headed up the european anti-war front against the recent u.s. military operations in iraq .
neither greece , which currently holds the eu rotating presidency , nor eu chief diplomat javier solana , who is responsible for the union 's foreign and security policies , went to brussels - not to mention britain , the most important military power in the current 15-member alliance .
to general astonishment belgium , germany , france and luxembourg 's unilateralism did not emerge as an anti-american demonstration or alienate the rest of the eu club .
instead the four heads of state actually managed to give european security and defense policy - which has been going nowhere for some time - a new impetus . rejuvenation the suggestions include creating an eu military headquarters to lead the union 's rapid reaction force , to improve air transport capacities and to establish effective protection against nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
european union member states are meant to carry out the changes in cooperation in order to share tight military resources and budgets and ultimately become more powerful as an alliance .
the suggestions are n't new ; they have been issues for some time in nato and in the european security and defense union , the eu counterpart to the north atlantic military alliance , though little has been done so far .
but after the iraq war , it seems that the four european statesmen are anxious to put the pedal to the metal . we will have to wait and see whether joint military armament will actually be a success , but doubt is already warranted , since the states ' defense budgets are scarcely able to meet current needs . mending ties what was more important about this summit , however , was the political message that gerhard schröder , jacques chirac , guy verhofstadt and jean-claude juncker unanimously relayed : transatlantic relations are indispensable .
chancellor schröder brought it to the point : " in nato , we do not have too much america , we have too little europe . "
on top of that , the suggestions to strengthen military ties and cooperation within the union are open to all other eu states , including britain , spain and italy - the main european advocates for the war against iraq - in particular . those are quite a few results for a two-hour meeting .
they included a glimmer of hope that the dissonance - or , more accurately , the ice age in europe as a result of the iraq war - will end soon and they are also an offer of reconciliation to the united states . gerda meuer is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " anti-war " summit backs stronger euro military european leaders attending a controversial defense summit in brussels on tuesday agreed to coordinate military operations alongside nato , while reaffirming their commitment to the transatlantic alliance .

2001 .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell is expected to visit germany in mid-may - a move being interpreted on both sides of the atlantic as an attempt to heal strained ties between berlin and washington . in a sign that efforts are slowly but surely underway to repair the tattered transatlantic relationship , the white house confirmed this week that secretary of state colin powell is planning a visit to berlin in mid-may .
though the german foreign ministry has emphasized that no concrete date has oficially been set for powell ’ s visit , sources have told leading german newspapers he 'll be arriving around may 14 .
german chancellor schröder ’ s spokesman , thomas steg , underscored the importance berlin is attaching to powell ’ s when he said in berlin earlier this week that powell is " welcome in berlin anytime . "
steg added that the chancellor would use powell ’ s trip to hold extensive talks with him .
" we ’ d be happy even if he decided to come earlier , " steg said .
transatlantic ties damaged powell is the highest-ranking bush administration official to pay a visit to germany since ties between washington and berlin soured at the peak of national elections here last september .
schröder was reelected last autumn at least partially on the basis of his strident anti-war stance and his refusal to involve germany in any kind of u.s-led military action in iraq .
but his use of the pacifist card in the campaign was seen by many in washington as blatant electioneering and his rhetoric accusing the bush administration of " military adventurism " over iraq angered u.s. officials .
amid talk of " poisoned relations " and " lasting damage to the u.s.-german relationship , " transatlantic ties suffered another setback when schröder ’ s justice minister compared president bush ’ s political tactics with those of adolf hitler .
schröder ’ s failure to remove the minister immediately from her cabinet post resulted in further antagonizing an already incensed washington .
german anti-war stance frustruates u.s. in recent months , schröder ’ s partnership with france , russia and china to form an anti-war axis against the u.s.-led military operations in iraq , which has seen the u.s. and britain going to war without a u.n. resolution , has further strained ties between berlin and washington .
it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy told dw-world last week .
" what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . "
berlin changes tack after iraq war but the end of the iraq war has seen a marked change in german foreign policy priorities .
chancellor schröder has shown himself to be eager to mend fences with the u.s.
" no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " schröder said after meeting with british premier tony blair earlier this month .
germany 's main opposition parties , which stood against schröder ’ s anti-american line during the election , have also welcomed powell ’ s visit .
wolfgang schäuble - the foreign policy spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , in parliament - said powell 's decision to visit berlin did not surprise him . " i ’ ve always considered the bush administration ’ s politics to be much more clever than they are occasionally portrayed here , " he said on monday .
" i have the impression that the german government has realized in the past months that they committed a grave foreign policy mistake .
now they are correcting it , " schäuble said .
washington ready for talks the white house , too , has signaled it is ready to resume cooperation with berlin .
" we ’ re more than happy to work together with the german government in fields where we have common interests , " a source told the financial times deutschland newspaper on monday .
the u.s. government , according to media reports , is expected to call on germany to help with the reconstruction of postwar iraq .
" it ’ s really up to germany to decide , how they want to participate , " the source said .
foreign policy experts are also underscoring the importance of powell ’ s visit at such a sensitive time .
james lindsay , a member of the national security council under former president clinton and a member of the independent think-tank brookings institution told the financial times deutschland germany should support the u.s. in the security council when it comes to lifting the sanctions on iraq and should avoid criticizing u.s. policies in iraq " just the fact that we ’ re treating this visit as big news shows how bad the situation is , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .

this is because many areas operate " feeder schools " where primary schools have special relationships with local secondaries and send the majority of their pupils on to a small number of local schools .
the idea is to ease the transition at 11 - and give parents a degree of certainty about what school their child will move on to .
but what happens when the " feeder school " policy is changed ?
today , we looked at two cases - in london and in west berkshire - where a small change in policy may spell disappointment for children who thought they had their secondary school future mapped out .
graham young 's story graham young lives in cold ash , west berkshire .
the village is lucky to have one of the top 60 primary schools in england , st marks .
but his local education authority has changed the school st marks feeds into by moving the boundary of the catchment area .
instead of feeding a secondary school one and a half miles from his home , it will now feed another one five miles away .
so graham 's daughter , who 's currently at primary school , will end up at a different school from his son , who 's already at secondary school , causing huge inconvenience to the family .
west berkshire council , which runs grahams local schools , says it 's trying to acheive the best use of resources in the area .
changes to catchment areas are always intended to benefit the greatest number of pupils , as some schools fill up and other places become available elsewhere .
but graham fears the policy will lead to greater congestion and inconvenience for many families. click here to watch our west berkshire case study in full camden , north london in north london , the situation is even more confused .
at the moment , many children attending primary schools in one borough , islington , go on to attend secondary school in neighbouring camden .
now , camden wants to re-draw the rules to give priority to children who went to primary schools within its borders .
parents argue that well established links between feeder schools and secondaries will be destroyed , harming their children 's education .
they 're also unhappy that the new policy gives priority to camden residents , even if they 've chosen to go private at primary level. click here to watch our case study from camden send us your stories e-mail us at breakfasttv @ bbc.co.uk send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : town / city : commenting on : comments : home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments see also : 29 apr 03 -pipe- breakfast lack of local schools 28 apr 03 -pipe- breakfast a new system for england internet links : ofsted reports bbc news online 's education section advisory centre for education the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

this might make good headlines , but is n't entirely fair .
to use the terminology in vogue at the moment , the napf is not against " fat cat pay " per se , as long as it is justified through good performance .
in a global economy it is necessary , vital even , that there are global pay packages on offer at uk companies so they can attract global performers - as long as there is global performance .
last autumn , we and the association of british insurers urged companies to stop " rewarding failure " in the form of guaranteed bonuses and other contract terms that were n't linked to performance .
new rules what is happening now is part of our remit to encourage companies to adopt good corporate practice in areas of disclosure , pay packages and performance .
the napf 's voting issues service -lrb- vis -rrb- has , for some years , been at the forefront of analysis of company governance , looking at the annual reports and advising our members - who represent a fifth of uk stock market investors - on how to vote in annual general meetings .
what has caught the attention this year has been the new government rules requiring full disclosure of executive remuneration packages .
this has allowed a more in-depth analysis of all companies by vis .
the napf can claim some success with companies .
two years ago , vodafone was criticised for its corporate governance .
following seven months of discussion with vis , its last remuneration package was heralded as a " model of good corporate governance " .
companies , themselves , are gradually waking up to the benefits of good governance .
ten years ago , two -lrb- or more -rrb- year rolling contracts were common place .
now , two-thirds of ftse companies apply one-year maximum rolling contracts .
fat cats and you so how does this affect you , the individual ?
if you are a member of an occupational pension scheme or have a personal pension , you may well have concerns about how your retirement pot is doing , especially in this economic climate .
it is vital that companies perform to the best of their abilities so that investors - including you through your pension plan - get the best returns for your money .
good corporate governance generally translates into better corporate performance and better management of downside risk .
this will lead to well-run companies , boosting economic performance , and benefiting you as a pension saver .
this is an issue where the uk leads the world .
we at the napf will continue to encourage ftse companies to maintain this lead .
doing so benefits us all whether we are institutional investors , individuals or companies .

mr mandelson recalled how he told the prime minister that his career and even his life would be destroyed by a second resignation from the cabinet .
but despite looking " pained " , mr blair said he had no other option than demanding that mr mandelson step down as northern ireland secretary .
in his interview with daily mirror editor piers morgan for the bbc one tabloid tales programme , mr mandelson admitted the £ 373,000 home-loan from fellow mp geoffrey robinson which led to his first resignation in 1998 was " a legitimate story " .
but he said he had done nothing wrong in the hinduja passport application affair .
the indian brothers had given £ 1m to the millennium dome and later successfully applied for british passports , but mr mandelson said the press was " wrong " to accuse him of lying .
geoffrey offered to bridge the financial gap in my arrangements - now was there anything illegal , improper about all this ?
peter mandelson on home loan " i knew i had n't done anything wrong , " he said .
" the allegations that were being cooked up i knew were false .
i did not believe for one moment that the thing would be so badly handled and such a muddle created that it would result in my departure from government . "
he added : " what happened in all that was a sort of a chasm opened up in front of me over this allegation of cash for passports , which was complete nonsense .
" -lsb- it -rsb- could have been easily dealt with , if only we 'd been on top of the facts and not muddled through and just been precise in what we said to the press .
but we were n't . "
mr mandelson recalled his encounter with the prime minister when mr blair made clear he would have to resign for a second time .
" i said , ' are you going to destroy my entire political career , if not my life , on the basis of one morning 's newspaper headlines ? ' .
" and he looked pained , very pained - as i 'm sure he was - and said , ' i 'm afraid i do n't think i have any alternative ' . "
' extensive publicity ' mr mandelson said when he was first in the cabinet as minister without portfolio with responsibility for the dome he had not taken the right approach to publicity .
" i committed the mortal sin with good publicity , or extensive publicity .
instead of just enjoying it , i inhaled .
and i think i probably did inhale a bit too much . "
and mr mandelson admitted he had been " technically " wrong not to tell his building society about his house loan from mr robinson , although he insisted there had been nothing improper about it .

samer kurdi , a businessman living in amman with his american wife and their baby boy , describes the impact on jordan .
i believe my attitude towards this war before it started is representative of the attitudes of most people in jordan and the region - suspicion of the americans and the reasons behind this war .
the americans have little credibility in this part of the world , largely because of their bias towards israel at the expense of the palestinians .
i 've never been to baghdad , but the sight of it being bombed was very disturbing to me and to everybody i know .
despite the circumstances and my own support for the deposition of the iraqi regime , i felt that the bombing of baghdad was a violation .
ever since the first gulf war , jordan has become home to a fairly large community of iraqis , either fleeing saddam or just trying to make a living .
a couple of nights before baghdad fell , i went to an iraqi restaurant in downtown amman - a popular , cheap place always crowded with iraqi expatriates and workers .
incarnation of evil that night it was empty .
the iraqi young man who served me said that most of his clientele had gone back to iraq , some to be with their families " to protect their families " , some , according to him , went back to fight .
this man was quite forthcoming with his views .
" anybody is better than saddam , " he said .
he was shia , and saddam , he said , prevented them from taking part in friday prayers .
that , for him , seemed to be the clincher ; the irrevocable proof that saddam was the incarnation of evil .
" but we do n't like the americans , " he added , " the americans better watch out .
if they are ' bad ' then the iraqis will boot them out . "
country profile : jordan the next day the airport fell , and soon after statues were toppling on all the satellite tv stations .
it was a very significant , sobering moment for jordanians .
shock and shame , but shame , i suppose , mainly that baghdad -lrb- and iraq -rrb- could fall so quickly to an invading force .
as far as i could tell there were n't very many jordanians who , deep down , wanted saddam to survive .
many , perhaps the majority , merely wanted the us to pay a high price , to be bogged down in a vietnam-style quagmire - to have a perceived american arrogance deflated .
iraqis and jordanians alike were generally glad to see the regime gone , but there 's also a lot of apprehension , even a sense of foreboding as to what 's going to happen next .
i know of an iraqi woman whose husband , a professor , had a falling out with the regime a number of years ago and left his country and his position in an iraqi university as a result .
these people were no fans of saddam , and yet i heard she actually had a breakdown the night it became clear that baghdad had fallen to the americans and she was taken to hospital .
the majority of people were happy that things have changed , but many felt that somehow their own pride had been stepped on in the process , most vividly symbolised by the bombing then the fall and subsequent looting of baghdad .
things were changing in the arab world even before the americans began the war .
when i was growing up there was no such thing as real arab media , just government sponsored rhetoric .
these " broadcast services " still exist today , but this war has illustrated that today there is mainstream arab media that is on par with that in the west , and is even better when it comes to coverage of this part of the world .
arab rhetoric i am proud of the way that a lot of satellite arab networks covered this war , proud that these services have demonstrated that there is even such a thing as an arab " voice " .
it might be true that many of these arab stations had a certain slant and subscribe to a certain distinctly arab rhetoric , but they also managed in many cases to provide a more objective coverage than their counterparts in the west .
do i think there 's going to be a peaceful and stable future for iraq ?
i do , because iraq has money , and everybody wants it to be a stable , safe place to do business -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- .
i work for a jordanian pharmaceutical company and iraq has traditionally been our biggest market .
this is also true for the jordanian economy as a whole .
this war has had a significant adverse effect on us and all jordanian businesses , and the whole business community in jordan is waiting impatiently for order and stability to return so that they can get down to business again .
the best thing to come out of this war , in my view , is that the us now is directly engaged with the arab masses .
as someone who knows the americans and has spent lots of time in america , i am certain that this can only be a good thing .
i believe that if all parties involved at least became more culturally aware of the other , the causes of peace and stability in this region will receive a boost .

samer kurdi , a businessman living in amman with his american wife and their baby boy , describes the impact on jordan .
i believe my attitude towards this war before it started is representative of the attitudes of most people in jordan and the region - suspicion of the americans and the reasons behind this war .
the americans have little credibility in this part of the world , largely because of their bias towards israel at the expense of the palestinians .
i 've never been to baghdad , but the sight of it being bombed was very disturbing to me and to everybody i know .
despite the circumstances and my own support for the deposition of the iraqi regime , i felt that the bombing of baghdad was a violation .
ever since the first gulf war , jordan has become home to a fairly large community of iraqis , either fleeing saddam or just trying to make a living .
a couple of nights before baghdad fell , i went to an iraqi restaurant in downtown amman - a popular , cheap place always crowded with iraqi expatriates and workers .
incarnation of evil that night it was empty .
the iraqi young man who served me said that most of his clientele had gone back to iraq , some to be with their families " to protect their families " , some , according to him , went back to fight .
this man was quite forthcoming with his views .
" anybody is better than saddam , " he said .
he was shia , and saddam , he said , prevented them from taking part in friday prayers .
that , for him , seemed to be the clincher ; the irrevocable proof that saddam was the incarnation of evil .
" but we do n't like the americans , " he added , " the americans better watch out .
if they are ' bad ' then the iraqis will boot them out . "
country profile : jordan the next day the airport fell , and soon after statues were toppling on all the satellite tv stations .
it was a very significant , sobering moment for jordanians .
shock and shame , but shame , i suppose , mainly that baghdad -lrb- and iraq -rrb- could fall so quickly to an invading force .
as far as i could tell there were n't very many jordanians who , deep down , wanted saddam to survive .
many , perhaps the majority , merely wanted the us to pay a high price , to be bogged down in a vietnam-style quagmire - to have a perceived american arrogance deflated .
iraqis and jordanians alike were generally glad to see the regime gone , but there 's also a lot of apprehension , even a sense of foreboding as to what 's going to happen next .
i know of an iraqi woman whose husband , a professor , had a falling out with the regime a number of years ago and left his country and his position in an iraqi university as a result .
these people were no fans of saddam , and yet i heard she actually had a breakdown the night it became clear that baghdad had fallen to the americans and she was taken to hospital .
the majority of people were happy that things have changed , but many felt that somehow their own pride had been stepped on in the process , most vividly symbolised by the bombing then the fall and subsequent looting of baghdad .
things were changing in the arab world even before the americans began the war .
when i was growing up there was no such thing as real arab media , just government sponsored rhetoric .
these " broadcast services " still exist today , but this war has illustrated that today there is mainstream arab media that is on par with that in the west , and is even better when it comes to coverage of this part of the world .
arab rhetoric i am proud of the way that a lot of satellite arab networks covered this war , proud that these services have demonstrated that there is even such a thing as an arab " voice " .
it might be true that many of these arab stations had a certain slant and subscribe to a certain distinctly arab rhetoric , but they also managed in many cases to provide a more objective coverage than their counterparts in the west .
do i think there 's going to be a peaceful and stable future for iraq ?
i do , because iraq has money , and everybody wants it to be a stable , safe place to do business -lrb- especially the americans -rrb- .
i work for a jordanian pharmaceutical company and iraq has traditionally been our biggest market .
this is also true for the jordanian economy as a whole .
this war has had a significant adverse effect on us and all jordanian businesses , and the whole business community in jordan is waiting impatiently for order and stability to return so that they can get down to business again .
the best thing to come out of this war , in my view , is that the us now is directly engaged with the arab masses .
as someone who knows the americans and has spent lots of time in america , i am certain that this can only be a good thing .
i believe that if all parties involved at least became more culturally aware of the other , the causes of peace and stability in this region will receive a boost .
