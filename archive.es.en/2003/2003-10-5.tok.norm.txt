eu members - present and future - gathered in rome saturday to begin final negotations on an eu constitution .
but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .
drawing what he described as a " red line that could not be crossed , " british foreign secretary jack straw stood behind the united kingdom ’ s position that the role of the planned eu foreign secretary should be limited .
the financing carrot some leaders also made implicit financial threats to encourage nations that have criticized the draft constitution to jump on the bandwagon .
after its expansion , the eu will have to restructure its finances , contributions and subsidies .
though germany ’ s schröder said that no country should give financial incentives for another country to agree to the constitution , he hinted that countries not backing it might suffer when it comes to eu funding .
" of course there ’ s a link , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who will be attending the remaining negotiation sessions , said there was no formal connection between the constitution and eu financing .
however , he warned that if the intergovernmental conference extended its work beyond the agreed to deadline , there could be problems .
" i don ’ t have to point out the fact that it would be an undesirable prospect for us to deal simultaneously with unsolved institutional issues as well as financing issues , the negotiations surrounding which we ’ ve all recognized as difficult , " fischer said . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape read dw-world 's full coverage of the creation of the european union 's first constitution - from the drafting convention to the intergovernmental conference that will determine its fate .

eu members - present and future - gathered in rome saturday to begin final negotations on an eu constitution .
but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "

but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .
drawing what he described as a " red line that could not be crossed , " british foreign secretary jack straw stood behind the united kingdom ’ s position that the role of the planned eu foreign secretary should be limited .
the financing carrot some leaders also made implicit financial threats to encourage nations that have criticized the draft constitution to jump on the bandwagon .
after its expansion , the eu will have to restructure its finances , contributions and subsidies .
though germany ’ s schröder said that no country should give financial incentives for another country to agree to the constitution , he hinted that countries not backing it might suffer when it comes to eu funding .
" of course there ’ s a link , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who will be attending the remaining negotiation sessions , said there was no formal connection between the constitution and eu financing .
however , he warned that if the intergovernmental conference extended its work beyond the agreed to deadline , there could be problems .
" i don ’ t have to point out the fact that it would be an undesirable prospect for us to deal simultaneously with unsolved institutional issues as well as financing issues , the negotiations surrounding which we ’ ve all recognized as difficult , " fischer said . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape read dw-world 's full coverage of the creation of the european union 's first constitution - from the drafting convention to the intergovernmental conference that will determine its fate . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu members - present and future - gathered in rome saturday to begin final negotations on an eu constitution .
but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .
drawing what he described as a " red line that could not be crossed , " british foreign secretary jack straw stood behind the united kingdom ’ s position that the role of the planned eu foreign secretary should be limited .
the financing carrot some leaders also made implicit financial threats to encourage nations that have criticized the draft constitution to jump on the bandwagon .
after its expansion , the eu will have to restructure its finances , contributions and subsidies .
though germany ’ s schröder said that no country should give financial incentives for another country to agree to the constitution , he hinted that countries not backing it might suffer when it comes to eu funding .
" of course there ’ s a link , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who will be attending the remaining negotiation sessions , said there was no formal connection between the constitution and eu financing .
however , he warned that if the intergovernmental conference extended its work beyond the agreed to deadline , there could be problems .
" i don ’ t have to point out the fact that it would be an undesirable prospect for us to deal simultaneously with unsolved institutional issues as well as financing issues , the negotiations surrounding which we ’ ve all recognized as difficult , " fischer said . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape read dw-world 's full coverage of the creation of the european union 's first constitution - from the drafting convention to the intergovernmental conference that will determine its fate .

eu members - present and future - gathered in rome saturday to begin final negotations on an eu constitution .
but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .
drawing what he described as a " red line that could not be crossed , " british foreign secretary jack straw stood behind the united kingdom ’ s position that the role of the planned eu foreign secretary should be limited .
the financing carrot some leaders also made implicit financial threats to encourage nations that have criticized the draft constitution to jump on the bandwagon .
after its expansion , the eu will have to restructure its finances , contributions and subsidies .
though germany ’ s schröder said that no country should give financial incentives for another country to agree to the constitution , he hinted that countries not backing it might suffer when it comes to eu funding .
" of course there ’ s a link , " he said .

but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .

eu members - present and future - gathered in rome saturday to begin final negotations on an eu constitution .
but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline . rome - the leaders of the european union ’ s 15 current members , along with the 10 accession states set to join in may , sat at a massive table in the middle of a marble-lined ceremonial room at rome ’ s palace of congresses on saturday .
they were joined by candidate states bulgaria , rumania and turkey , which were bestowed with observer status , and the presidents of the european commission and european parliament .
each party politely recited their known positions about the draft european constitution .
though each country was only permitted to speak for four minutes , it took two hours before all the countries were finished .
the symbolic opening of the intergovernmental conference underscored the problems the european union faces as it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
the eu will become much more difficult to steer and decision-making processes will last much longer .
for that reason , german chancellor gerhard schröder said , expansion and the agreement over a constitutionaintended to create effective institutions , are two sides of the same coin .
" we believe the draft before us realizes the potential of reaching a general consensus , and that ’ s why we ’ re supporting it , " schröder said .
germany , france , italy back draft france and italy also called on delegates at the conference to approve the current version of the constitution as drafted by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing at the european convention after 16 months of work in brussels .
but spain and poland , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as foreseen in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
fifteen smaller eu countries , including denmark , are demanding that they each be given a seat on the european commission .
" i think we can make a compromise during these three months where we have for every country a commissioner with a voting right , but we have to look into the question of the portfolios , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told deutsche welle .
sources told deutsche welle that the german delegation was prepared to discuss the number of commissioners , even though enlarging the commission wouldn ’ t make the eu ’ s top policy-making body and more efficient in decision-making .
berlusconi : step up to the challenge italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who as rotating president of the eu presidency led the meeting , warned countries not to put their own national interests above the common good the european union .
" no constitution can come into being and have a chance of surviving if the vital national interests of even one member state are left out of the equation , " he said .
" all nations must sign it .
yet putting those national interests first and foremost is also an insurmountable obstacle for the birth of a genuine constitution . "
germany ’ s schröder , meanwhile , said he believed a deal would be achieved by the december deadline .
" i believe that the ultimate decision , as always at such conferences , will be met in december , " the chancellor said .
" in any case , i hope we ’ ve covered the necessary distance by then and can decide in december .
then we ’ ll also see if and which possibilities for compromise exist . "
at the same time , schröder warned against high expectations at the start of the negotiations in rome .
" ultimate decisions never come at the opening of a government conference , and none of us expected that , " schröder said .
but on saturday , the differences of opinion still divided the leaders .
drawing what he described as a " red line that could not be crossed , " british foreign secretary jack straw stood behind the united kingdom ’ s position that the role of the planned eu foreign secretary should be limited .
the financing carrot some leaders also made implicit financial threats to encourage nations that have criticized the draft constitution to jump on the bandwagon .
after its expansion , the eu will have to restructure its finances , contributions and subsidies .
though germany ’ s schröder said that no country should give financial incentives for another country to agree to the constitution , he hinted that countries not backing it might suffer when it comes to eu funding .
" of course there ’ s a link , " he said .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who will be attending the remaining negotiation sessions , said there was no formal connection between the constitution and eu financing .
however , he warned that if the intergovernmental conference extended its work beyond the agreed to deadline , there could be problems .
" i don ’ t have to point out the fact that it would be an undesirable prospect for us to deal simultaneously with unsolved institutional issues as well as financing issues , the negotiations surrounding which we ’ ve all recognized as difficult , " fischer said . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape read dw-world 's full coverage of the creation of the european union 's first constitution - from the drafting convention to the intergovernmental conference that will determine its fate .

shadow home secretary oliver letwin even likened " blair 's britain " to baghdad .
and following the first incident - the fatal shooting of nottingham jeweller marian bates on tuesday - her bereaved family challenged ministers to " put their money where their mouth is " on crime .
' unacceptable rise ' the calls came as home secretary david blunkett heralded record numbers of police officers in his labour party conference speech .
the following morning 32-year-old david king was shot dead outside a gym in hertfordshire .
home office officials issued a statement on saturday , following a third shooting in reading on friday night , designed to reassure the public that gun crime was not out of control .
" while every incidence of gun crime is very serious , it is also a relatively rare crime , committed by a small number of people on a small number of people .

the statement said legislation alone would not solve the problem .
but it said it was working closely with community groups to stop the emergence of gun culture , funding some in the worst affected areas with money confiscated from criminals .
a gun amnesty in april was declared a success after 43,908 guns and 1,039,358 rounds of ammunition were handed in .

collider is assembled in ultra-clean conditions -lrb- image : cern -rrb- scientists are currently constructing the world 's largest particle accelerator .
its aim is to simulate the big bang that created the universe .
when it is ready in 2007 , it will run under the swiss countryside in a huge circle .
the particles fired down its length will generate enough data in a year to fill a pile of cds the size of the eiffel tower .
what to do with that data and how to share it with scientists around the world is the essence of the grid , the name given to the international network of supercomputers that promises to revolutionise not just the way we use the internet , but computing itself .
for now the grid is composed of noisy , air-conditioned computer centres dotted around the world , full of pcs all linked together to make a giant super-computer .
scientists are currently limited in what they can do by their own hardware 's memory , software and processing power .
once the grid is up and running anyone hooked up to it will have all the programs , power and storage they could dream of .
speed of light " the idea is that even in a small institute where a physicist may need to have very large computing power for his particular problem , he can go off from his desk , launch the job and get the job done using computer centres all over the world , get the results back and write the publication afterwards , " said wolfgang von ruden , head of information technology at cern .
when it is ready , cern 's large hadron collider will be sunk underground , where particles will smash into each other just below the speed of light .
the accelerator will test the big bang theory -lrb- image : cern -rrb- just as cern has used contractors to find the tools and talent for the job of putting the collider together , so the grid will employ a similar agent .
it will use software designed to sniff out where in the world are the computing resources - software , memory , processing power - for a particular task .
in short , computing is becoming a utility to be piped into your home or office , like electricity or gas .
" if you understand the web to be a source of information , you have servers which provide the information and you as a user are not aware of where those servers sit , you just go to a link , you click on it and you get the information , " said ian bird , grid deployment manager .
" you can think of the grid in the same terms except that it is providing computing services and storage services on your behalf at places that you do n't really have to know where they are . "
web creators scientific applications aside , the grid 's impact will be felt most strongly in businesses , such as design or architectural firms , heavily reliant on the latest software .
for now they can only dream of getting their hands on the toweringly expensive software needed to prepare a bid for big ticket commissions .
designs by small architectural companies are limited by the technology the firms can afford to buy .
hooked up to the grid , and all the software and processing power it promises , the complexity of the projects a firm could take on would be limited only by the architect 's ambition and imagination .
if you suspect the claims being made for the grid are over-blown and exaggerated , you might bear in mind that it was scientists at cern who invented the world wide web .

collider is assembled in ultra-clean conditions -lrb- image : cern -rrb- scientists are currently constructing the world 's largest particle accelerator .
its aim is to simulate the big bang that created the universe .
when it is ready in 2007 , it will run under the swiss countryside in a huge circle .
the particles fired down its length will generate enough data in a year to fill a pile of cds the size of the eiffel tower .
what to do with that data and how to share it with scientists around the world is the essence of the grid , the name given to the international network of supercomputers that promises to revolutionise not just the way we use the internet , but computing itself .
for now the grid is composed of noisy , air-conditioned computer centres dotted around the world , full of pcs all linked together to make a giant super-computer .
scientists are currently limited in what they can do by their own hardware 's memory , software and processing power .
once the grid is up and running anyone hooked up to it will have all the programs , power and storage they could dream of .
speed of light " the idea is that even in a small institute where a physicist may need to have very large computing power for his particular problem , he can go off from his desk , launch the job and get the job done using computer centres all over the world , get the results back and write the publication afterwards , " said wolfgang von ruden , head of information technology at cern .
when it is ready , cern 's large hadron collider will be sunk underground , where particles will smash into each other just below the speed of light .
the accelerator will test the big bang theory -lrb- image : cern -rrb- just as cern has used contractors to find the tools and talent for the job of putting the collider together , so the grid will employ a similar agent .
it will use software designed to sniff out where in the world are the computing resources - software , memory , processing power - for a particular task .
in short , computing is becoming a utility to be piped into your home or office , like electricity or gas .
" if you understand the web to be a source of information , you have servers which provide the information and you as a user are not aware of where those servers sit , you just go to a link , you click on it and you get the information , " said ian bird , grid deployment manager .
" you can think of the grid in the same terms except that it is providing computing services and storage services on your behalf at places that you do n't really have to know where they are . "
web creators scientific applications aside , the grid 's impact will be felt most strongly in businesses , such as design or architectural firms , heavily reliant on the latest software .
for now they can only dream of getting their hands on the toweringly expensive software needed to prepare a bid for big ticket commissions .
designs by small architectural companies are limited by the technology the firms can afford to buy .

scientists are currently constructing the world 's largest particle accelerator .
its aim is to simulate the big bang that created the universe .
when it is ready in 2007 , it will run under the swiss countryside in a huge circle .
the particles fired down its length will generate enough data in a year to fill a pile of cds the size of the eiffel tower .
what to do with that data and how to share it with scientists around the world is the essence of the grid , the name given to the international network of supercomputers that promises to revolutionise not just the way we use the internet , but computing itself .
for now the grid is composed of noisy , air-conditioned computer centres dotted around the world , full of pcs all linked together to make a giant super-computer .
scientists are currently limited in what they can do by their own hardware 's memory , software and processing power .
once the grid is up and running anyone hooked up to it will have all the programs , power and storage they could dream of .
speed of light " the idea is that even in a small institute where a physicist may need to have very large computing power for his particular problem , he can go off from his desk , launch the job and get the job done using computer centres all over the world , get the results back and write the publication afterwards , " said wolfgang von ruden , head of information technology at cern .
when it is ready , cern 's large hadron collider will be sunk underground , where particles will smash into each other just below the speed of light .
just as cern has used contractors to find the tools and talent for the job of putting the collider together , so the grid will employ a similar agent .
it will use software designed to sniff out where in the world are the computing resources - software , memory , processing power - for a particular task .
in short , computing is becoming a utility to be piped into your home or office , like electricity or gas .
" if you understand the web to be a source of information , you have servers which provide the information and you as a user are not aware of where those servers sit , you just go to a link , you click on it and you get the information , " said ian bird , grid deployment manager .
" you can think of the grid in the same terms except that it is providing computing services and storage services on your behalf at places that you do n't really have to know where they are . "
web creators scientific applications aside , the grid 's impact will be felt most strongly in businesses , such as design or architectural firms , heavily reliant on the latest software .
for now they can only dream of getting their hands on the toweringly expensive software needed to prepare a bid for big ticket commissions .
designs by small architectural companies are limited by the technology the firms can afford to buy .
hooked up to the grid , and all the software and processing power it promises , the complexity of the projects a firm could take on would be limited only by the architect 's ambition and imagination .
if you suspect the claims being made for the grid are over-blown and exaggerated , you might bear in mind that it was scientists at cern who invented the world wide web .

the ftse 100 index jumped 2.8 % last week to close at 4,257 on friday , fully recouping heavy losses the previous week triggered by concerns over a weakening dollar and rising oil prices .
the rally came as the market digested news of the first net weekly increase in us employment levels since january , along with far better than expected uk growth figures .
the data reinforced hopes that the global economy is on the verge of a rebound after three years of sub-par growth , lifting economically sensitive banking and energy stocks .
traders continue to hope that strong third quarter corporate earnings , due out in the next few weeks , will provide concrete evidence that a turnaround is indeed under way .
corporate hopes however , some forecasters warn that with expectations for the third quarter results season running high , investors may be disappointed .
the hawkish tone of september 's mpc minutes suggests that this meeting will be a close call hsbc bank " we still feel very wary about conditions , notwithstanding the better -lrb- us jobs figures -rrb- , " said jeremy batstone , head of investment strategy at the fyshe group .
" the fact remains that going into the third quarter , profit expectations are very aggressive . "
mr batstone warned that in order to meet their profit forecasts , big us firms may be forced to cut costs by laying off more staff , ensuring that unemployment levels continue to rise in the medium term .
the weaker dollar , which will hurt export earnings in europe , and could also increase inflationary pressures in the us , is also clouding the horizon .
fyshe group strategists believe that the ftse is on target to end the year at about 4,500 .
for the past six weeks , the index has hovered either side of 4,200 for about six weeks without convincingly breaking the 4,300 barrier .
mpc time this week , uk investors will be focusing mainly on the bank of england 's interest rate decision for october , due out at midday on thursday .
while most forecasters expect rates to remain on hold at 3.5 % this time , tentative signs of accelerating growth and persistently high levels of consumer debt have lifted the probability of a rate increase before the end of the year .
the minutes of the bank 's interest rate meeting last month showed that some monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- members were coming round to the view that rates should rise in the near future .
" the hawkish tone of september 's mpc minutes suggests that this meeting will be a close call , " analysts at hsbc bank wrote in a note to clients .
investors will also be keeping an eye on the outcome of the regulatory inquiry into the proposed merger between itv broadcasters carlton and granada , expected on tuesday .
carlton and granada shareholders will be hoping that the government clears the tie-up without forcing the companies to sell off their advertising sales departments .
carlton and granada have previously warned that disposing of their sales houses - a suggested remedy designed to limit the impact of the merger on the television advertising market - would undo many of the benefits of the merger .
the retail sector will also be in the spotlight , with trading statements due from marks & spencer , carphone warehouse , boots , and matalan .

the ftse 100 index jumped 2.8 % last week to close at 4,257 on friday , fully recouping heavy losses the previous week triggered by concerns over a weakening dollar and rising oil prices .
the rally came as the market digested news of the first net weekly increase in us employment levels since january , along with far better than expected uk growth figures .
the data reinforced hopes that the global economy is on the verge of a rebound after three years of sub-par growth , lifting economically sensitive banking and energy stocks .
traders continue to hope that strong third quarter corporate earnings , due out in the next few weeks , will provide concrete evidence that a turnaround is indeed under way .
corporate hopes however , some forecasters warn that with expectations for the third quarter results season running high , investors may be disappointed . "
the hawkish tone of september 's mpc minutes suggests that this meeting will be a close call " hsbc bank " we still feel very wary about conditions , notwithstanding the better -lrb- us jobs figures -rrb- , " said jeremy batstone , head of investment strategy at the fyshe group .
" the fact remains that going into the third quarter , profit expectations are very aggressive . "
mr batstone warned that in order to meet their profit forecasts , big us firms may be forced to cut costs by laying off more staff , ensuring that unemployment levels continue to rise in the medium term .
the weaker dollar , which will hurt export earnings in europe , and could also increase inflationary pressures in the us , is also clouding the horizon .
fyshe group strategists believe that the ftse is on target to end the year at about 4,500 .
for the past six weeks , the index has hovered either side of 4,200 for about six weeks without convincingly breaking the 4,300 barrier .
mpc time this week , uk investors will be focusing mainly on the bank of england 's interest rate decision for october , due out at midday on thursday .
while most forecasters expect rates to remain on hold at 3.5 % this time , tentative signs of accelerating growth and persistently high levels of consumer debt have lifted the probability of a rate increase before the end of the year .
the minutes of the bank 's interest rate meeting last month showed that some monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- members were coming round to the view that rates should rise in the near future .
" the hawkish tone of september 's mpc minutes suggests that this meeting will be a close call , " analysts at hsbc bank wrote in a note to clients .
investors will also be keeping an eye on the outcome of the regulatory inquiry into the proposed merger between itv broadcasters carlton and granada , expected on tuesday .
carlton and granada shareholders will be hoping that the government clears the tie-up without forcing the companies to sell off their advertising sales departments .
carlton and granada have previously warned that disposing of their sales houses - a suggested remedy designed to limit the impact of the merger on the television advertising market - would undo many of the benefits of the merger .
the retail sector will also be in the spotlight , with trading statements due from marks & spencer , carphone warehouse , boots , and matalan .
