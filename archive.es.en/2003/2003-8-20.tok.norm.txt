the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2003 politicians demand hostages pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taste of freedom - some of the tourists arrive in germany after their six-month kidnapping ordeal .
the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .
trapattoni 's latest stint as national coach of the ' azzurri ' brings him once again up against the country which embraced him .
" it is not a friendly but a difficult test , a classic game , " trapattoni told the italian sport daily corriere dello sport .
the italians have beaten germany nine times , including a victory in the 1982 world cup final , while the germans have been victors on seven occasions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .

ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "

at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

the statement added that porsche was also confident of racking up another record profit for the previous fiscal year , which ended on july 31 .
although riding high on strong sales for its new cayenne sport utility vehicle , porsche 's initial forecast for this fiscal year was above the 75,000 sale mark .
even so , impressive sales in the united states , where the company sells almost half of its cars , have contributed to an estimated sales figure marginally less than first thought . more briefs 20.08.2003 -pipe- prosieben signs exclusive deal with paramount 19.08.2003 -pipe- business indicator hints at german recovery 19.08.2003 -pipe- hot summer sends producer prices rising 19.08.2003 -pipe- mercedes looks east for truck ventures 19.08.2003 -pipe- germany threatened with eu sanctions 19.08.2003 -pipe- lufthansa included in swiss bid rumors 19.08.2003 -pipe- henkel profits rise as sales drop off 19.08.2003 -pipe- brothel keeper clashes with labor office radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2003 keep it in the family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shipbuilder hdw : made in germany but in u.s. hands the german government plans to hamper the sale of defense firms to foreigners , especially u.s. buyers .
but the german defense industry disapproves and calls for open markets instead of more restrictions . brows have been furrowed in german ministries ever since daimlerchrysler started looking for foreign buyers for its defense sector subsidiary mtu aero engines .
chancellor gerhard schröder and his ministers have already made their standpoint clear .
" germany has an interest in the mass of capacities we have in defense staying in germany , " schröder said on friday . several potential buyers have already expressed their interest in the munich aero engine manufacturer , among them the carlyle group from the united states .
the german government is apparently concerned that german defense firms will be sold off , in particular to u.s. competitors . this is n't the first time a german defense firm has attracted foreign interest .
in march 2002 , the u.s. investor group one equity partner acquired the kiel shipbuilder howaldtswerke deutsche-werft -lrb- hdw -rrb- , the world 's leading producer of submarines .
now hdw is up for sale again , and this time another u.s. firm , northrup grumman , is one of the heavyweights among the prospective buyers .
chancellor schröder has already indicated that he would prefer a " german solution " - or at least a european one . fear of lost know-how bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck instead of just wringing its hands in anguish , the government has decided it should have the last word in defense industry sales .
it has announced that a bill will be presented to parliament this fall to make it more difficult to sell german defense firms to foreign companies .
the bill would allow the government to veto the sale of a german company specializing in defense if foreigners intend to acquire more than 25 percent in the firm .
defense minister peter struck -lrb- picture -rrb- said in an interview on tuesday that such company takeovers result in a sudden absence of german know-how . the german defense industry does n't think much of the planned legislation .
a specialist in the defense industry at the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , timm meyer , expressed the fear that foreign investors could be scared away and german defense firms could find it more difficult to maintain their involvement in the european defense industry . " cross-border alliances are indispensable , " meyer said in an interview with deutsche welle .
the stricken german defense industry , which has shrunk by two-thirds since 1990 , has no choice given the low number of contracts , he said .
" the question is how the companies can survive .
if they do n't find partners in germany or europe , the transatlantic solution is the only option . " insular u.s. market the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , a german-french-spanish cooperation , views the german government 's plans as a step backwards .
" there are too few contracts available in the defense industry .
instead we need more investment in the field of defense and above all reliability in planning , " rainer ohler , a spokesman for eads in germany , told deutsche welle .
he favored a model such as in britain .
" there the nationality of a defense firm does n't matter .
instead the point is what the company can contribute to great britain , " ohler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads wants to expand its defense strategy .
eads plans to increase its defense sector by two-thirds , to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- , by 2005 .
but on the european market there 's limited room for expansion ; the united states is still the , most lucrative market .
there , however , european competitors are hindered by strict regulations that favor u.s. firms .
only u.s. companies , for instance , may sell security technologies there .
" here too , we are against insularism and for open markets , " ohler said . ohler was hopeful that eads could win the pentagon 's confidence .
it has already delivered helicopters to the u.s. coast guard and police forces .
however , things still do n't look good for european defense companies in the united states .
on the other hand , u.s. firms already own one-fifth of the european defense market . finance minister wolfgang clement , who has supported proposing the new , limiting legislation , offered an additional possibility in a newspaper interview on tuesday : " maybe one could even appeal to the patriotism of company heads , " he said .
" in the u.s.a. it would be a matter of course .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2003 politicians demand hostages pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taste of freedom - some of the tourists arrive in germany after their six-month kidnapping ordeal .
the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .
trapattoni 's latest stint as national coach of the ' azzurri ' brings him once again up against the country which embraced him .
" it is not a friendly but a difficult test , a classic game , " trapattoni told the italian sport daily corriere dello sport .
the italians have beaten germany nine times , including a victory in the 1982 world cup final , while the germans have been victors on seven occasions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .

" but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .
trapattoni 's latest stint as national coach of the ' azzurri ' brings him once again up against the country which embraced him .
" it is not a friendly but a difficult test , a classic game , " trapattoni told the italian sport daily corriere dello sport .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2003 politicians demand hostages pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taste of freedom - some of the tourists arrive in germany after their six-month kidnapping ordeal .
the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .
-lrb- august 19 , 2003 -rrb- schröder rules out troops for iraq the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . "

germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2003 politicians demand hostages pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taste of freedom - some of the tourists arrive in germany after their six-month kidnapping ordeal .
the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .

the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .
trapattoni 's latest stint as national coach of the ' azzurri ' brings him once again up against the country which embraced him .
" it is not a friendly but a difficult test , a classic game , " trapattoni told the italian sport daily corriere dello sport .
the italians have beaten germany nine times , including a victory in the 1982 world cup final , while the germans have been victors on seven occasions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands .

germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .
-lrb- august 19 , 2003 -rrb- schröder rules out troops for iraq the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . "

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .

ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .

20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .
-lrb- august 19 , 2003 -rrb- schröder rules out troops for iraq the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . "
-lrb- august 14 , 2003 -rrb- u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .
i also believe that the teams i 've just named have more in-depth strength than we have . "
it may just be strategy on ballack 's part .
germany are in a strong position in their qualifying group for euro 2004 , even though they have failed to really impress so far .
wednesday night 's practice match against three-time world champions italy will be anything but a friendly and any psychological advantages the teams can get over each other will help once the leather starts flying .
ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .
kahn upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn 's not happy with some of his colleagues .
one person who can not be accused of using a subtle strategy is ballack 's bayern colleague and german captain oliver kahn .
the towering goalkeeper has recently criticized the weak mentality of german players who fail to turn up for international duty due to minor injury complaints .
völler has had a major headache getting the walking wounded to the training pitch after a frantic start to the domestic bundesliga season and the national team is ravaged by injuries for the italy game in stuttgart .
völler is without ballack , dortmund 's thorsten frings and liverpool 's didi hamann .
kahn has weighed in with his own comments on the subject , saying he believes some players need to show more commitment to the german cause .
" it can not carry on that players remain at home just because their left toe hurts , " kahn raged to german daily bild .
" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "
german fans will be hoping that their team finds some kind of cohesion within its ranks on wednesday night against the italians and carry it on into the qualifiers against scotland and iceland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the return of trap .
the visit of italy heralds the return of coach giovanni trapattoni -lrb- picture -rrb- who managed bayern munich in the 1990 's .
trapattoni 's latest stint as national coach of the ' azzurri ' brings him once again up against the country which embraced him .
" it is not a friendly but a difficult test , a classic game , " trapattoni told the italian sport daily corriere dello sport .

the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .
the attack on the u.n. headquarters will add to the mounting pressure on the united states to find willing partners to share the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq . washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country since the end of major combat operations was announced in may .
it may well argue now that a more concerted international effort , including the deployment of troops from a wider cast of nations , is needed to bring the perpetrators and like-minded groups in iraq to justice and to restore order . no german troops only last week , german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated his position on the subject of a peacekeeping contribution when he warned against " wild speculation " over a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
escalating violence in the wake of this latest baghdad bombing may do little to convince the chancellor to change his mind . u.n. resolution 1500 , passed last week , was put forward by the united states in the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq . with the security situation in iraq now at a dangerous all-time low since the end of ' official ' war hostilities and with prominent non-combat targets on the hit list of terrorists and underground guerrilla forces at large in iraq , already skeptical nations may now be even harder to convince . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem .
-lrb- august 19 , 2003 -rrb- schröder rules out troops for iraq the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . "
-lrb- august 14 , 2003 -rrb- u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

"
germany 's soccer stars warm up for important euro 2004 matches with a tough friendly game against italy on wednesday , but some players have all but written off the struggling squad 's chances in international competition . as europe 's soccer nations gear up for a key round of matches in this year 's qualification stage for the 2004 european championships in portugal , germany takes on italy in a friendly game in preparation for make-or-break matches against scotland and iceland .
but instead of relishing the challenge of stretching the muscles against an old foe , some of germany 's stars have been deriding their own chances of success in next year 's championships and aiming barbed words at their national colleagues .
german footballer of the year michael ballack has put the boot in on germany 's chances of winning a fourth european title in portugal next summer by saying that he believes the three-time world cup winners are just not good enough . " all the teams want to win but for some it is not a realistic goal .
i do n't think we belong as the favorites , " the midfielder recently told german newspaper die welt . " teams like france , the netherlands , spain and italy are ahead of us , " the bayern munich playmaker added .
ballack , who shined in last year 's impressive , although ultimately unsuccessful , world cup campaign in japan and korea , explained that the german national team found itself in a difficult phase where younger players who have been brought in by coach rudi völler needed to adapt .
" that will take time .

ballack 's words could also be used as a buffer between the team and the supporters who witnessed their country come so close to world cup glory last year and expect their boys to go one step further next summer .

" brazilians come to international matches carrying their head under their arm . "
not one to fear becoming unpopular with colleagues , the bayern munich shot-stopper , who has won 60 caps for his country , added that all germany 's games are vital for the country , including friendly matches .
" everything is part of the course over the next three years , " explained kahn .
" therefore every international match from now on is important . "

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .

just as it appeared the united states might grudgingly accept that the world body should play a greater role in the reconstruction of iraq , the attack has delivered a devastating blow to u.n. efforts to help rebuild the war-torn country . besides the high human cost , the death of u.n. special representative to iraq sergio vieira de mello and others who had come to iraq to assist in the rebuilding of the country raises serious questions about the future involvement of the international community and support networks in the country . condemning the blast and expressing anguish at the deaths , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said the united nations no intention of pulling out of iraq and that the security council would meet later in the day to discuss its next move . “ i hope to see iraq restored as soon as possible to peace , security and full independence .
the united nations will make every effort to bring that about , " he said in stockholm , sweden before heading back to u.n. headquarters in new york . eu staff pulling out officials from the european union echoed the statements from the u.n. that the atrocity would not shake the international community 's commitment to rebuilding iraq and bringing stability back to the war-torn country .
the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana strongly condemned the attack and expressed sympathy to the relatives of the victims and to the united nations and its staff before adding , " the eu strongly supports the u.n. 's important ongoing role in the reconstruction of iraq . " but at the same time , the european commission on wednesday said it was recalling staff from baghdad , which could end up delaying eu reconstruction aid to iraq .
“ the mission has been disbanded .
the staff are trying to make their way out of the country , ” commission spokesman michael mann said .
“ obviously our need assessment process will be affected by what has happened , ” he said , referring to the eu ’ s plans to have an overview of what iraq needs for reconstruction before an international aid summit in spain later this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured man is evacuated by u.s. troops from the united nations headquarters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2003 politicians demand hostages pay up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taste of freedom - some of the tourists arrive in germany after their six-month kidnapping ordeal .
the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release . when the 14 european tourists held hostage nearly half a year in the sahara desert touched down in cologne-bonn airport on wednesday morning , they were greeted with check-waving politicians demanding that the freed captives foot the bill for their costly release operation .
on tuesday , deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , pointed to the hefty bill .
tourists who " frivolously get into danger just for the thrill of it , should be prepared to pay a part of the costs involved in their release , " bosbach said .
he added there were some citizens who traveled to risky areas in the expectation , that if something went wrong , the government would take care of it and german taxpayers would pay for the entire operation to secure their release .
bosbach ’ s statement sparked a heated round of debate as politicians of all stripes jumped into the discussion on whether or not tourists should be held accountable in the event of a hostage situation .
publicity earnings to help pay the bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phillipine soldiers take action against the kidnappers .
ludger volmer , foreign policy spokesman for the ruling junior coalition green party said , " when travelers invite risks upon themselves , the costs for the necessary state intervention can not be saddled onto the general public . "
volmer pointed to another similar case when german tourists taken hostage on the island of jolo in the philippines three years ago , paid a share of the costly operation -lrb- photo -rrb- to get them released .
" the jolo hostages earned money at the time by selling the exclusive rights to their story .
but we didn ’ t give them the full bill , " volmer , a former deputy foreign minister , stressed .
at the same time volmer said the current discussion was " redundant " because according to germany ’ s consular law , it was the government ’ s duty to help its citizens , who stray into danger overseas .
" on the other hand , the same law says the bill should be charged , at least in part , to the affected persons , " he explained .
ernst hinsken of the conservative christian social union , urged the freed hostages and their families to voluntarily pay the state a part of the money they would make by selling the rights to their story .
" insensitive " discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fourteen european tourists disembark at cologne-bonn airport in germany from a military plane on wednesday , aug .
20 , 2003 several other politicians called the discussion " absurd " and " insensitive " at a time when the hostages were being reunited with families and friends after a harrowing ordeal .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , who played a key role in negotiating the release of the tourists , said it was the wrong time for such debates .
" we should distance ourselves from all critical questions for now , " he said .
" i think , we should first be happy about the outcome .
it could have been much worse . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer refused to answer questions on the tourists ’ share of the financial costs .
" today is the day of their return , the hostages need to recover first , " he said .
chancellor schröder only indirectly referred to the issue during a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" let me in this hour of joy remind , perhaps even warn , our fellow citizens to prepare their travels to ensure their own safety as much as possible . "
the 14 european tourists , including nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while traveling by motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles in southern algeria , a region notorious for smuggling and banditry .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may when they invaded the group ’ s camp .
the kidnappers are believed to belong to the islamist salafist group for preaching and combat and are said to enjoy ties to al qaeda .
after the hideout was stormed several of the kidnappers killed , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month , where official negotiators from all three countries established contact with the kidnappers .
questions abound over ransom payment but even as the debate over the financial costs of the operation hit the press , it still remained unclear whether the german government had paid a ransom at all to the kidnappers .
german public television ard reported the government had paid € 4.6 million to the militants for the release of the hostages in addition to a negotiation fee .
the overcall cost did not exceed five million , ard said and added the kidnappers had originally demanded € 45 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mali president amadou toumani toure however , the government refused to confirm the amount and denied other reports that the malian government -lrb- photo -rrb- had paid the five-million-euro ransom , which berlin allegedly would pay back in the form of developmental aid .
on monday , foreign minister fischer underlined the government ’ s strict policy on not dealing directly with kidnappers and never paying ransom .
but few in germany are buying the government line .
many german newspapers speculated the government did indeed pay a ransom and even terrorism experts aren ’ t ruling it out .
rolf tophoven , head of the essen institute for terrorism research and security policy said in a newspaper interview , " it ’ s clear that money was paid , otherwise one wouldn ’ t get anything . "
terrorism expert elmar theveßen agreed .
" we ’ ll probably never know the exact sum of ransom money .
but hopefully it was enough . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

the us-based organisation human rights watch says these groups , which are most at risk of contracting the hiv virus , are suffering attacks from powerful criminals .
and it says health workers trying to promote safe sex have also suffered from police intimidation .
traumatising at-risk people and prevention services could lead to an aids explosion in the country , it warns .
" bangladesh is brutalizing exactly the people it most needs as allies if it is to avoid a severe aids epidemic , " human rights watch researcher vivek maru says in a report published on wednesday .
" violence against at-risk people traumatised them and drives them out of reach of hiv prevention services , which can increase their risk of infection . "
rape claims the rate of hiv infection in bangladesh is much lower than in neighbouring india .
but the human rights watch report says that among injecting drug-users in one part of the country , the infection rate more than doubled to 4 % in 2002 .
the report quotes a 26-year-old prostitute , jahan , who says prostitutes are frequently raped by police in hotels .
in one incident she describes how a policeman refused to use a condom .
" why should i use a condom with you ... you are not my wife , i do n't care about your children , " the policeman told her , she says .
last may the uk-based group amnesty international made scathing criticisms of bangladesh 's human rights record , giving particular attention to the police and army .

drug-resistant hiv a growing number of people who contract hiv are already resistant to some of the existing drugs used to fight the disease .
this makes it increasingly difficult for doctors to treat them .
this does not mean patients should take less of their drugs to avoid creating resistance dr david bangsberg a study , published in july , found one in 10 new cases of hiv in europe were resistant to at least one key drug .
dr david bangsberg and colleagues at the university of california san francisco looked at 148 patients taking anti-retrovirals .
they were all homeless , living in shelters or b & bs .
all had a detectable viral load - which means the medication they were taking was insufficient to control their virus .
the researchers carried out spot checks on each of these patients every three to six weeks over the course of one year .
they counted their pills to see if they were taking their drugs properly .
they also carried out blood tests to measure their hiv levels and to see if the virus was mutating .
the researchers found that patients who took 80 % or more of their pills were twice as likely to be carrying a mutated form of the virus compared to patients who took 40 % of their drugs or less .
the mutations were new and had occurred during the course of 12-month study .
treatment dr bangsberg described the findings as surprising .
but he said hiv patients on anti-retrovirals should continue taking their medication .
" what is surprising is that what we typically take to be excellent pill-taking - 80 % of pills or better - leads to more resistance than occasional or inconsistent-pill taking , " he said .
" this does not mean patients should take less of their drugs to avoid creating resistance .
" good adherence to the drug regimens still is the best bet to prevent becoming ill or dying with hiv / aids .
" many patients with excellent , even perfect pill-taking are living longer with resistant virus than those who do not take medication to select for resistant virus . "
dr bangberg said the findings could lead to changes in the way doctors treat hiv patients who are regarded as unlikely to take their drugs properly .
" these findings will make us rethink the argument that life-saving anti-retroviral drugs should be denied to some populations because poor pill-taking behaviour might accelerate the creation of resistant mutations of the hiv virus , " he said .
keith alcorn , a senior editor at the national aids manual , told bbc news online : " this shows people need to be monitored regularly and treatment needs to be changed quickly if it fails .
" otherwise , people would be doing what they think is the right thing by taking as much medication as possible , but which may make the situation worse . "

it found that the more assiduous these patients were at taking their medication , the faster the virus became drug-resistant .
the research did not say taking medication as instructed causes hiv to become drug-resistant .
hiv is thought to mutate in people who fail to take their pills , and some doctors deny anti-retrovirals to patients who are unlikely to take their drugs properly .
drug-resistant hiv a growing number of people who contract hiv are already resistant to some of the existing drugs used to fight the disease .
this makes it increasingly difficult for doctors to treat them .
this does not mean patients should take less of their drugs to avoid creating resistance dr david bangsberg a study , published in july , found one in 10 new cases of hiv in europe were resistant to at least one key drug .
dr david bangsberg and colleagues at the university of california san francisco looked at 148 patients taking anti-retrovirals .
they were all homeless , living in shelters or b & bs .
all had a detectable viral load - which means the medication they were taking was insufficient to control their virus .
the researchers carried out spot checks on each of these patients every three to six weeks over the course of one year .
they counted their pills to see if they were taking their drugs properly .
they also carried out blood tests to measure their hiv levels and to see if the virus was mutating .
the researchers found that patients who took 80 % or more of their pills were twice as likely to be carrying a mutated form of the virus compared to patients who took 40 % of their drugs or less .
the mutations were new and had occurred during the course of 12-month study .
treatment dr bangsberg described the findings as surprising .
but he said hiv patients on anti-retrovirals should continue taking their medication .
" what is surprising is that what we typically take to be excellent pill-taking - 80 % of pills or better - leads to more resistance than occasional or inconsistent-pill taking , " he said .
" this does not mean patients should take less of their drugs to avoid creating resistance .
" good adherence to the drug regimens still is the best bet to prevent becoming ill or dying with hiv / aids .
" many patients with excellent , even perfect pill-taking are living longer with resistant virus than those who do not take medication to select for resistant virus . "
dr bangberg said the findings could lead to changes in the way doctors treat hiv patients who are regarded as unlikely to take their drugs properly .
" these findings will make us rethink the argument that life-saving anti-retroviral drugs should be denied to some populations because poor pill-taking behaviour might accelerate the creation of resistant mutations of the hiv virus , " he said .

powergen said one unit of its power station at grain , near rochester , would come back into action in september .
the move comes amid concern that the closing down of plants following a fall in electricity prices could test the network this winter .
powergen chief executive , dr paul golby , said : " the reason we 've taken this step is to provide more power this winter , when demand is at its highest and wholesale prices are at a level that potentially makes it economic to generate from this unit . "
the unit at grain has a capacity of 650 megawatts - enough to provide power for around half a million people .
two of grain 's four units have been mothballed for some time with the remaining units following suit in october last year and march .
dr golby said it was a short-term move affecting one unit at grain only .

the undamaged half of the bedfordshire complex is due to reopen in september with an intake of 60 female detainees .
it is expected to provide accommodation for about 400 single female and family groups by 2005 .
local resident margaret turner , chairwoman of yarl 's wood liaison committee , said that a uk immigration service official told a recent meeting that at present there are " no medium or long term plans to rebuild " the damaged part of the centre .
however , a spokesman for the home office said that at present " no decision has yet been taken " on whether to rebuild the centre .
the government is also looking forward to the completion of the independent report into the events at yarl 's wood being conducted by stephen shaw , prisons and probation ombudsman .
mrs turner said people were also concerned that the fencing around the centre .
she said video footage - released after the trial of those accused of being part of a riot at yarl 's wood - of asylum seekers breaking down the fencing at the centre showed its inadequacy .
" we have expressed our concerns to the government , " she said .
tom foster , a bedford borough and bedfordshire county councillor for the area including yarl 's wood , said he was still unhappy with the private security firm group 4 running the centre .
during the yarl 's wood trial , group 4 , faced a barrage of criticism from judge roger sanders , prosecutor nigel rumfitt qc and defence lawyers , including claims that it is a " national laughing stock " and allegations of delay , obstruction and potential contamination of evidence .
the company has strenuously rejected the allegations .
mr foster said : " that place should not open with group 4 in charge until the government inquiry reports -lrb- on group 4 's role -rrb- . "
on friday , nigerian henry momodou , 39 , and albanian behar limani , 27 , were jailed for four years each after they were convicted of violent disorder at the centre on 14 february 2002 when the asylum centre was destroyed by fire .
previously , two other men also involved in the incident were jailed .
a 29-year-old algerian , ahmed aliaine , who was described as a " leading player " and a " one-man fighting machine " , admitted violent disorder and received 18 months .
moroccan naseem mosstaffa , 25 , pleaded guilty to affray and was jailed for three months .
