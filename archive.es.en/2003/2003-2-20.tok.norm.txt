11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .

i had the feeling that , despite the protests , -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair would not listen to the people , and that the only thing to do was to take action myself .
i heard about the human shields from a friend some months ago and immediately decided to take part . immediately ? yes , on the spot .
there was no doubt at all .
in my job , i have taken my annual leave - who knows , it could be my permanent leave . where will you be located in iraq and are there any plans as to where you will act as a " human shield " ? we have no idea where we are going .
due to security reasons , the organization can not tell us any exact details .
we do not know what will await us in iraq .
but we will be the guests of the iraqis , who are a wonderful , stalwart , people - people who have taken so much in stride and have n't buckled under it . are you scared ? yes , of course i am scared .
i belong to a generation which has n't experienced war .
for us , war is just in our imagination . do you feel stronger due to last weekend 's widespread peace protests ? i think the protests will help diplomacy and that they will concentrate minds on diplomacy .
the less they listen , the more protests there will be . some criticize what you are doing , saying that as a " human shield " you are working with iraq . it 's not up to any head of state to bring a leader to fall , no matter who is he is .
it is the task of the people .
we are going in solidarity with the people of iraq , and we are trying for a diplomatic solution . thirty six percent of the iraqi population is 16 or under .
declaring a war on iraq is declaring a war on children .
it is utterly immoral ! you visited iraq once before , three years ago .
what impressions did you take back home with you ? despite what people say about baghdad , i was free to walk on my own and no one begged from me .
i can remember standing in a lift surrounded by iraqis .
when they asked me where i came from i thought about saying france or russia , but decided on telling the truth .
no one remarked on my being british , and they were just as friendly .
i visited the poorest parts of the city , visited a children 's hospital and saw the suffering caused by the sanctions . right now , i 'd rather be there than here . interview conducted by louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the human shields mission to iraq 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .

i had the feeling that , despite the protests , -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair would not listen to the people , and that the only thing to do was to take action myself .
i heard about the human shields from a friend some months ago and immediately decided to take part . immediately ? yes , on the spot .
there was no doubt at all .
in my job , i have taken my annual leave - who knows , it could be my permanent leave . where will you be located in iraq and are there any plans as to where you will act as a " human shield " ? we have no idea where we are going .
due to security reasons , the organization can not tell us any exact details .
we do not know what will await us in iraq .
but we will be the guests of the iraqis , who are a wonderful , stalwart , people - people who have taken so much in stride and have n't buckled under it . are you scared ? yes , of course i am scared .
i belong to a generation which has n't experienced war .
for us , war is just in our imagination . do you feel stronger due to last weekend 's widespread peace protests ? i think the protests will help diplomacy and that they will concentrate minds on diplomacy .
the less they listen , the more protests there will be . some criticize what you are doing , saying that as a " human shield " you are working with iraq . it 's not up to any head of state to bring a leader to fall , no matter who is he is .
it is the task of the people .
we are going in solidarity with the people of iraq , and we are trying for a diplomatic solution . thirty six percent of the iraqi population is 16 or under .
declaring a war on iraq is declaring a war on children .
it is utterly immoral ! you visited iraq once before , three years ago .
what impressions did you take back home with you ? despite what people say about baghdad , i was free to walk on my own and no one begged from me .
i can remember standing in a lift surrounded by iraqis .
when they asked me where i came from i thought about saying france or russia , but decided on telling the truth .
no one remarked on my being british , and they were just as friendly .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.02.2003 herbert grönemeyer – king of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer : germany 's answer to bruce springsteen veteran german musician herbert grönemeyer scooped up the top prize at the echo music awards this weekend .
it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .
“ i don ’ t know , ” he told an interviewer once .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .
“ i don ’ t know , ” he told an interviewer once .

i had the feeling that , despite the protests , -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair would not listen to the people , and that the only thing to do was to take action myself .
i heard about the human shields from a friend some months ago and immediately decided to take part . immediately ? yes , on the spot .
there was no doubt at all .
in my job , i have taken my annual leave - who knows , it could be my permanent leave . where will you be located in iraq and are there any plans as to where you will act as a " human shield " ? we have no idea where we are going .
due to security reasons , the organization can not tell us any exact details .
we do not know what will await us in iraq .
but we will be the guests of the iraqis , who are a wonderful , stalwart , people - people who have taken so much in stride and have n't buckled under it . are you scared ? yes , of course i am scared .
i belong to a generation which has n't experienced war .
for us , war is just in our imagination . do you feel stronger due to last weekend 's widespread peace protests ? i think the protests will help diplomacy and that they will concentrate minds on diplomacy .
the less they listen , the more protests there will be . some criticize what you are doing , saying that as a " human shield " you are working with iraq . it 's not up to any head of state to bring a leader to fall , no matter who is he is .
it is the task of the people .
we are going in solidarity with the people of iraq , and we are trying for a diplomatic solution . thirty six percent of the iraqi population is 16 or under .
declaring a war on iraq is declaring a war on children .
it is utterly immoral ! you visited iraq once before , three years ago .
what impressions did you take back home with you ? despite what people say about baghdad , i was free to walk on my own and no one begged from me .
i can remember standing in a lift surrounded by iraqis .
when they asked me where i came from i thought about saying france or russia , but decided on telling the truth .
no one remarked on my being british , and they were just as friendly .
i visited the poorest parts of the city , visited a children 's hospital and saw the suffering caused by the sanctions . right now , i 'd rather be there than here . interview conducted by louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the human shields mission to iraq 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.02.2003 herbert grönemeyer – king of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer : germany 's answer to bruce springsteen veteran german musician herbert grönemeyer scooped up the top prize at the echo music awards this weekend .
it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .

i had the feeling that , despite the protests , -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair would not listen to the people , and that the only thing to do was to take action myself .
i heard about the human shields from a friend some months ago and immediately decided to take part . immediately ? yes , on the spot .
there was no doubt at all .
in my job , i have taken my annual leave - who knows , it could be my permanent leave . where will you be located in iraq and are there any plans as to where you will act as a " human shield " ? we have no idea where we are going .
due to security reasons , the organization can not tell us any exact details .
we do not know what will await us in iraq .
but we will be the guests of the iraqis , who are a wonderful , stalwart , people - people who have taken so much in stride and have n't buckled under it . are you scared ? yes , of course i am scared .
i belong to a generation which has n't experienced war .
for us , war is just in our imagination . do you feel stronger due to last weekend 's widespread peace protests ? i think the protests will help diplomacy and that they will concentrate minds on diplomacy .
the less they listen , the more protests there will be . some criticize what you are doing , saying that as a " human shield " you are working with iraq . it 's not up to any head of state to bring a leader to fall , no matter who is he is .
it is the task of the people .
we are going in solidarity with the people of iraq , and we are trying for a diplomatic solution . thirty six percent of the iraqi population is 16 or under .
declaring a war on iraq is declaring a war on children .
it is utterly immoral ! you visited iraq once before , three years ago .
what impressions did you take back home with you ? despite what people say about baghdad , i was free to walk on my own and no one begged from me .
i can remember standing in a lift surrounded by iraqis .
when they asked me where i came from i thought about saying france or russia , but decided on telling the truth .
no one remarked on my being british , and they were just as friendly .
i visited the poorest parts of the city , visited a children 's hospital and saw the suffering caused by the sanctions . right now , i 'd rather be there than here . interview conducted by louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the human shields mission to iraq 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .

defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .
“ i don ’ t know , ” he told an interviewer once .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .

i had the feeling that , despite the protests , -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair would not listen to the people , and that the only thing to do was to take action myself .
i heard about the human shields from a friend some months ago and immediately decided to take part . immediately ? yes , on the spot .
there was no doubt at all .
in my job , i have taken my annual leave - who knows , it could be my permanent leave . where will you be located in iraq and are there any plans as to where you will act as a " human shield " ? we have no idea where we are going .
due to security reasons , the organization can not tell us any exact details .
we do not know what will await us in iraq .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.02.2003 herbert grönemeyer – king of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer : germany 's answer to bruce springsteen veteran german musician herbert grönemeyer scooped up the top prize at the echo music awards this weekend .
it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .
“ i don ’ t know , ” he told an interviewer once .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.02.2003 first guilty verdict in sept .
11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.02.2003 herbert grönemeyer – king of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer : germany 's answer to bruce springsteen veteran german musician herbert grönemeyer scooped up the top prize at the echo music awards this weekend .
it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .
“ i don ’ t know , ” he told an interviewer once .

11 terrorism case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pronounced guilty - mounir el motassadeq the sentencing of mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison by a hamburg court marks the first conviction in the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "
decision applauded by german minister the result is sure to bring satisfaction to u.s. and german officials , who saw the trial as a measure of germany 's seriousness in pursuing and punishing those connected to the sept .
11 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .
people will know that what happened today was unfair .

11 , 2001 , attacks in the u.s. it 's being hailed as a test case for future al qaeda prosecutions . for minutes after the verdict was handed down , mounir el motassadeq sat quietly in the courtroom chair he has occupied for more than four months , his face wearing a blank expression as he came to grips with the fact that he will spend the next 14 years of his life in a german prison .
a hamburg court sentenced the 29-year-old moroccan student to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
evidence incriminating , says judge in a decision he read before the court , chief judge albrecht mentz and six other judges agreed with the federal prosecution 's charge that motassadeq was a committed and active member of mohammed atta 's hamburg-based al qaeda cell of terrorists suspected to be behind the sep .
11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the accused belonged to the group surrounding atta from the time it was founded .
this group of arab-muslim students planned the attacks out of hatred for the united states and israel , " mentz said .
the judge went on to say that the evidence , " confirmed that he knew of the plan and approved of it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .

it ’ s triumph over tragedy for the artist who lost both his wife and brother to cancer . the room fell silent this weekend at the echo music awards , germany 's top music industry prize , when one star launched into his acceptance speech .
and it wasn ’ t robbie williams . sure , williams was also there at this year ’ s awards ceremony in berlin , but it was for the veteran german rock legend , herbert grönemeyer that the audience hushed . with tears in his eyes , grönemeyer accepted an award for his single “ der weg ” -lrb- “ the way ” -rrb- – one of two awards he won that evening .
it was clearly an emotional moment for the 46-year old : for a song which contains the lyrics , “ life is not fair ” , it was already obvious to most that “ der weg ” was entirely autobiographical .
a piano ballad , " der weg " is a maelstorm of gut-wrenching lonliness and mourning as well as a moving ode to love . it was four years ago that the germans feared that grönemeyer had gone over the edge and would never come back .
he had just lost his wife , anna , and brother - both had had cancer .
after their deaths - which came within a week of one another - grönemeyer decided he ’ d had enough .
he packed his bags and moved to london with his two children . but after four years of self-imposed exile in the british capital , the success of his latest album “ mensch ” -lrb- “ human ” -rrb- - which has now sold over 2.6 million copies - has brought him back into the limelight in germany . he now plans to move back to berlin after he finishes his tour of germany this summer and there is even a new woman in his life .
this week , spiegel magazine reported that herbert grönemeyer 's new love is a 31-year-old swiss woman , sonja f. who picked him up in a zurich disco six months ago , according to eye witnesses . from orchestra pit to the stage born in 1956 in bochum in the industrial ruhr region of germany , grönemeyer was the son of an engineer .
he founded his first band in 1968 , but went into theatre after finishing high school , as the musical director of the bochum playhouse .
it was one of germany ’ s toniest theatres and the management insisted that he get out of the orchestra pit and act as well .
he did and landed roles in plays like the merchant of venice . indeed , whilst best known to his countrymen and women as a folk-rock legend , grönemeyer is better known abroad for his role as lieutenant werner in wolfgang petersen ’ s acclaimed 1981 film , das boot . “ airplanes in my head ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would be three years later that his rock breakthrough would come .
his album “ 4630 bochum ” – an ode to the mining city that had raised him – exploded on to the german charts .
the follow-up albums , “ bochum ” and “ airplanes in my head ” became grönemeyer classics and were later translated and recorded in english .
subsequent hits included songs like “ currywurst ” – celebrating that classic sausage-ketchup combo beloved of so many germans . but even with a back catalogue totalling 19 albums and a career spanning 23 years , the tragedy of losing his wife hit grönemeyer hard .
he was afraid that as well as losing his companion of 20 years , he would also lose his musical ability . it was not to be .
as well as setting up a london-based record label , grönemeyer spent a year in the studio himself and completed “ mensch ” last november .
an artistic and elegiac expression of his pain at losing two people he loved , it sold 500,000 in pre-release sales and grönemeyer went on to complete a sell-out tour of germany , austria and switzerland in winter 2002 . coming to terms with death " this album was definitely one of the toughest mountains i 've ever had to climb , " grönemeyer said .
for a long time after the death of his wife , he feared that he 'd lost the musical touch . " at first , not much happened , everything was gray and leaden .
then , at some point , i started to feel the oxygen again . " “ mensch is about coming to terms with things .
you want to work away the pain , but you can ’ t just shovel away mourning , like it ’ s some kind of pile of rubbish you want to get rid of .
it doesn ’ t work like that and it ’ s good that way , ” grönemeyer told the german magazine der spiegel . but if grönemeyer has triumphed over tragedy , he still doesn ’ t know the secret of his success .
“ i believe in the euphoric power of music , ” he said once .
but as to why his career has been so golden , he has no idea .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily german interior minister otto schily said : " i think this marks a success in the international fight against terrorism .
it is a harsh sentence , but i think it is justified . "
referring to the wider implications of the verdict , schily said , " it is a warning to all those who may think about becoming involved with a terrorist network . "
the severity of the verdict has also surprised prosecuting attorneys , who had planned on a conviction .
" to get the full 15 years is almost unheard of , " said burkhard kötke , one of the lawyers representing 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
he said the verdict was a positive development in germany 's fight against terrorism .
" the federal prosecutor was given encouragement in this trial and that is very positive , " said kötke , who said there will be additional trials in the coming months .
defense dejected defense attorneys were disappointed by the verdict .
they had argued that the evidence against motassadeq was nothing more than circumstantial and asked that their client , who has been in jail for more than a year , be released from custody .
throughout the trial , motassadeq and his defense attorneys have tried to show that he was no more than a good friend to the sept .
11 hijackers , who may have shared their anti-semitic and anti-american opinions , but not their violent convictions .
defense lawyers were especially irate that the u.s. prevented ramzi binalshibh - another suspected accomplice who is in american custody - from testifying in the trial , who they believe would have exonerated motassadeq .
" motassadeq was one of atta 's closest friends " mentz and the other judges summarily dismissed those attempts . mentz drew on the testimony given by more than 30 witnesses , some of them former roommates and friends of motassadeq , who told the court of the 29-year-old electrical engineering students ’ s gradual radicalization and the group ’ s evolution into a cell with a " sect-like character . "
" at the decisive point in the plot , -lrb- motassadeq -rrb- counted as one of atta ’ s closest friends , " mentz said , in reading the court ’ s decision .
motassadeq ’ s handling of money transfers and bill payments for group members marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , described by the defense as favors for friends , were further proof that motassadeq was a trusted member of the group , said mentz .
so too , was his trip to afghanistan at a time when his russian-born wife was pregnant with their first child .
" he was given the assignment to cover the tracks early on because he was trusted , " mentz said .
he told motassadeq that the court would look favorably on his case should he decide to hand in a full admission of guilt within a week .
verdict " unfair " say motassadeq 's friends friends of motassadeq who have attended almost every day of the more than four-month long trial , called the decision " unfair . "
" you could see from the very beginning that it would turn out that way , " said abu abderrahman , 39 .
he said it would be received badly , " not just in the arabic community , but worldwide .

washington has decided to hold off hauling the european union before international trade officials for refusing to allow the sale of genetically modified produce .
the us embassy 's official for agricultural affairs in london , peter kurz , told the bbc 's radio 4 farming today programme that a complaint would not be made to the world trade organisation for the time being .
mr kurz denied the concession was designed to curry favour among eu nations over a war against iraq .
" i would n't dream of speculating about any connection between this issue and any ... broader urgent issue in the world today , " he said .
" i happen to think that this decision is probably made on the merits of the issue itself . "
there have been a number of high profile , trade spats in recent years between the us and the eu .
mr kurz said the decision " was made at a high level of government . "
" i suppose the idea was we do n't need further trade irritants , " he said .
us ' may reconsider ' the eu banned all gm products in 1998 except soya , which had already been approved for sale in europe .
the us claims the ban broke wto trade rules .
" if there is some way of working this one out then so much the better , " mr kurz said .
" if not , then maybe the decision will have to be reconsidered . "
the us position is that europe should not discriminate against gm crops and produce , and not insist that they are specially labelled .
" this does not mean we 're still not very concerned about the moratorium on approval of new us gm crops or that we are not very concerned about the position on labelling and traceability , " mr kurz said .
" we believe that foods should not unnecessarily be labelled when there is no substantial difference between two foods according to the way they are produced . "

by mary gahan bbc news online business reporter hiding money under the mattress might seem the best option when the other choices at the moment are low interest rates on savings accounts and wobbly shares .
but now could be the time to get back into the stock market , according to the professional investors .
a few weeks ago shares in london were worth about half their value at the height of the stock market boom and have since moved only a little higher .
you can get blue-chip stocks yielding more than government bonds and you get opportunities like this very infrequently sacha sadan , gartmore investment management the attraction of buying again is to do with the dividends companies pay to their shareholders - and the value of those dividends in relation to the share price .
the return , or dividend yield , on the ftse all share index has risen to 4.23 % this month .
that is more than the interest rate on a typical savings account and more than the return on 10-year government bonds .
" now , if you sell equities and buy bonds you are not getting a yield pick-up , so why do it ? " asks alan custis , head of large uk stocks at jp morgan fleming asset management .
he says the last time the dividend yield was at this sort of level was in 1959 .
insurance sell-off typically dividend yields rise when share prices fall , making the shares better value .
as the ftse 100 falls , dividend yields rise in a mirror image for example , if a company 's share price is 100 pence and it pays a dividend of 4p it has a dividend yield of 4 % .
if the share price falls to 50p and it continues to pay a 4p dividend , the yield rises to 8 % .
the only caveat would be for most technology or " growth " shares , such as lastminute.com , which do not yet pay out a dividend .
last year the london stock market was one of the worst performing in the world , with the ftse 100 index of blue-chip shares losing nearly a quarter of their value ; and shares have continued to slide since then .
the uk markets were driven lower because insurance companies were forced to sell large amounts of equities to give them enough cash to cover pay-outs on policies .
' no debt splurge ' traditionally , bonds have offered investors a safe place to park their money in turbulent conditions , but shares are becoming more attractive again .
" the market is very good value , " says sacha sadan , uk equity fund manager at gartmore investment management .
buying yield on its own is not necessarily a recipe for making money alan custis , jp morgan fleming asset management " you can get blue-chip stocks yielding more than government bonds and you get opportunities like this very infrequently . "
mr custis highlights the difference between the london and new york markets .
" uk plc has not gone on the debt splurge that us companies went on .
the bottom line of this whole argument is that the growth in dividends is sustainable . "
shares can still fall he points out that big companies , such as unilever , astrazeneca and bp have all reported profits that were better than expected .
all of the great bull markets over time are associated with high dividend yields david schwartz , stock market historian and even though some firms are cutting dividend payments he says there are more risers than fallers .
lloyds tsb , for example , has a dividend yield of 8.5 % even though its profit figures were weak .
and abbey national , which announced a dividend cut , still has a yield of more than 5 % .
but he warns : " buying yield on its own is not necessarily a recipe for making money .
" with invensys , if you 'd just chased yield you 'd have dropped 50 % on the shares . "
investors would also have to buy shares at a low price to capitalise on a high yield .
war cloud history also seems to provide a valuable lesson .
" a high dividend yield is good for shares there 's no question about it , " says stock market historian david schwartz .
" all of the great bull markets over time are associated with high dividend yields ; the better it gets , the more investors are keen to move into equities instead of bonds or gilts . "
but he says : " using the dividend yield to predict where shares are going to be three months from today is absolutely useless . "
the feeling that shares are relatively cheap seems to be backed up by as survey of global fund managers by merrill lynch .
it found that nearly half believed world stock markets were undervalued , with another 38 % saying they were fair value .
so , if shares are such good value , why have they not risen more strongly as investors have come back to the market ?
" the one big problem on the horizon is iraq , " says mr custis , " and nobody is prepared to go major league into the market until that situation is sorted out . "

by mary gahan bbc news online business reporter hiding money under the mattress might seem the best option when the other choices at the moment are low interest rates on savings accounts and wobbly shares .
but now could be the time to get back into the stock market , according to the professional investors .
a few weeks ago shares in london were worth about half their value at the height of the stock market boom and have since moved only a little higher .
you can get blue-chip stocks yielding more than government bonds and you get opportunities like this very infrequently sacha sadan , gartmore investment management the attraction of buying again is to do with the dividends companies pay to their shareholders - and the value of those dividends in relation to the share price .
the return , or dividend yield , on the ftse all share index has risen to 4.23 % this month .
that is more than the interest rate on a typical savings account and more than the return on 10-year government bonds .
" now , if you sell equities and buy bonds you are not getting a yield pick-up , so why do it ? " asks alan custis , head of large uk stocks at jp morgan fleming asset management .
he says the last time the dividend yield was at this sort of level was in 1959 .
insurance sell-off typically dividend yields rise when share prices fall , making the shares better value .
as the ftse 100 falls , dividend yields rise in a mirror image for example , if a company 's share price is 100 pence and it pays a dividend of 4p it has a dividend yield of 4 % .
if the share price falls to 50p and it continues to pay a 4p dividend , the yield rises to 8 % .
the only caveat would be for most technology or " growth " shares , such as lastminute.com , which do not yet pay out a dividend .
last year the london stock market was one of the worst performing in the world , with the ftse 100 index of blue-chip shares losing nearly a quarter of their value ; and shares have continued to slide since then .
the uk markets were driven lower because insurance companies were forced to sell large amounts of equities to give them enough cash to cover pay-outs on policies .
' no debt splurge ' traditionally , bonds have offered investors a safe place to park their money in turbulent conditions , but shares are becoming more attractive again .
" the market is very good value , " says sacha sadan , uk equity fund manager at gartmore investment management .

it is thought to be the first case of its kind brought under the legislation , which was introduced last year .
the new law banning hunting with hounds came into effect last august .
two youths have been charged following a police investigation related to the hunting of foxes with dogs on farmland at hawick .
the papers are being delivered to the fiscal for the area .
he will study them before deciding whether or not there should be a prosecution .
observers believe that this is the first such action of its kind .
the teenagers , who have not been named , are also said to have broken laws designed to protect badgers .
the protection of wild mammals -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill was passed by msps last february .
scotland became the first part of the united kingdom to ban mounted hunting with hounds , effectively outlawing fox-hunting , fox-baiting and hare coursing .
the move was welcomed by supporters of the bill .
however , pro-hunt campaigners warned that the new law would cause " untold chaos " in rural areas .
the scottish countryside alliance -lrb- sca -rrb- said it would lead to unemployment and cause businesses to go bust .
