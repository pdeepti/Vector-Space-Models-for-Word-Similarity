thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .
“ now is not the time for blockades and backing down , ” said dieter hundt , who heads the german employers association . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the tinkering chancellor gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .
but editorialists warn he has failed to convince people of the utility of his plan .
-lrb- april 29 , 2003 -rrb- schröder urges reform as government cuts growth forecast german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support plans to reform the welfare system and boost the economy , as the government lowered its official growth forecast for 2003 .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways .

although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.05.2003 germany in brief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desert strip between illizi and bordj omar driss in central algeria where 31 european tourists went missing in mid-february .
missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .

“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.05.2003 germany in brief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desert strip between illizi and bordj omar driss in central algeria where 31 european tourists went missing in mid-february .
missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .
“ now is not the time for blockades and backing down , ” said dieter hundt , who heads the german employers association . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the tinkering chancellor gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.05.2003 u.s. artist to erect installation for hamburg 's red light district großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american artist jeff koons is to bring art to hamburg 's red light district .
controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .

" we will not let that happen .
i will not .

of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .

as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2003 state department praises german anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among germany 's successes in the war against terror this year was the conviction of mounir el motassadeq in hamburg .
in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.05.2003 germany in brief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the desert strip between illizi and bordj omar driss in central algeria where 31 european tourists went missing in mid-february .
missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .

“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .

normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .
“ now is not the time for blockades and backing down , ” said dieter hundt , who heads the german employers association . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the tinkering chancellor gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .
the probe singled out 1,150 students for further investigation .
germany also proposed extending the initiative europe wide , but critics in germany and abroad have said such profiling efforts violate the right to privacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracing the roots of terror a complete dw-world dossier of coverage of germany 's investigations on terrorist activities related to al qaeda and the sept .

a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .

agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "

11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .
german prosecutors and lawmakers moved quickly to strengthen national security laws , making it easier to act against extremist groups that had previously been able to operate under the country 's liberal " religious privilege " clause .
the legislation , passed in january 2002 , made it possible for the german government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state - whose spiritual leader metin kaplan is being held in a german prison awaiting extradition for murder charges in turkey - and al aqsa , a fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
the interior ministry also undertook an extensive computer-aided profiling program that sought to identify possible sleeper terrorists by pooling data on , among others , muslim male students between the ages of 18 and 40 from certain countries .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .

missing european tourists reported to be kidnapped , american cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by germany 's stance , beckenbauer threatens to quit from world cup organizing committee and more . missing european tourists kidnapped by bandits a french radio channel has reported that 31 european tourists , who have been missing in the sahara desert for months , have been kidnapped by smugglers and are being held in southern algeria .
algerian police are said to be negotiating a ransom of several million dollars with the smuggler group .
the channel rfi said that a planned military action by algerian authorities had been put on hold on account of the wishes of the german government .
fifteen of the kidnapped tourists are german nationals .
a high-ranking algerian politician told the the associated press news agency that all the tourists were alive and doing well .
the bandit group are said to be specialists in trade with weapons , stolen vehicles and cigarettes . links between the smugglers and islamic networks have been ruled out .
algerian police chief ali tounsi was in berlin earlier this week to discuss proceedings with the german government , which has insisted on negotiating with the kidnappers in order to avoid endangering the lives of the tourists .
airbus under pressure to favor european engine makers european aircraft maker airbus has once again postponed its decision on the billion dollar contract to supply engines for the a400 european military transport aircraft .
airbus chief noel forgeard said this week in toulouse that though the company was in favor of a reasonable price quoted by the canadian subsidiary of u.s. aero engine maker pratt & whitney , he wanted to give the rival consortium of european engine makers - which includes snecma of france , rolls-royce of britain and germany ’ s mtu - another week to rethink their offers .
amid intense lobbying by european engine makers to keep the lucrative contract within europe , french president jacques chirac threw his weight behind the european bid .
on the fringes of a defense summit called by germany , france , luxembourg and belgium , chirac made it clear to german chancellor schröder that he considered only european-built engines acceptable for the a400 .
germany , the biggest single backer of the a400 program with orders for 60 aircraft , has caused major delays in the project because of a lack of funds .
budgetary approval for the purchase is expected next month .
beckenbauer threatens to quit world cup committee german soccer legend franz beckenbauer has threatened to step down as president of germany ’ s 2006 world cup organizing committee over a dispute with fifa one day before its executive body meeting in zurich .
beckenbauer , president of bayern munich , accused soccer ’ s world ruling body of being chiefly interested in making money and of wanting to set unreasonably high ticket and hotel prices for packages for vips .
" fifa ’ s main goal is to make money and all the rest is secondary , " beckenbauer told friday ’ s issue of football magazine kicker .
" we will not let that happen .
i will not .
i would rather quit .
i would make my position available , this is a warning to zurich , " he said .
of the 3.2 million tickets for the world cup , fifa has said that up to 15 percent or 480,000 tickets will be reserved for vip ’ s and their accommodation .
" if you calculate it with each single person , you come to fantastic sums that can never be paid in germany , " beckenbauer said .
u.s. cabinet minister says u.s. hurt by german stance u.s. trade representative robert zoellick , the first american cabinet member to visit berlin since deep divisions between the two countries over the iraq war surfaced last year , said on friday the u.s. felt deeply hurt and betrayed by the row .
" there ’ s no denying how deep a sense of disappointment and hurt there is , " zoellick said .
" when the chips are down , we ’ d like to able to count on our friends and it ’ s difficult when our friends are against us , " zoellick said with reference to chancellor schröder ’ s anti-war alliance with france and russia . zoellick also told journalists in berlin that he believed mutual german-u.s. interests , especially in business , would bring the world ’ s first and third largest economic powers together again .
" i ’ m here to extend my hand , " he said .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .

“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways . " work on koon 's installation will begin later this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.05.2003 germany 's fischer touted for top eu foreign policy job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first eu foreign minister ?
german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .
“ now is not the time for blockades and backing down , ” said dieter hundt , who heads the german employers association . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the tinkering chancellor gerhard schröder tames his party by threatening to resign if it refuses to back his plan to kickstart the german economy .

thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms . german chancellor gerhard schröder was greeted with whistles and boos as he attended the main union rally in neu-anspach near frankfurt .
normally such an event would be a friendly setting for schröder , since the unions and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- are historically political allies . but unionists and the left-wing spd members have been up in arms , ever since the chancellor announced his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms last month .
the proposals aim to cut germany ’ s generous unemployment benefits and loosen job protection rules . “ i didn ’ t know that whistles counted as part of the unions ’ arguments , ” schröder said as he fought to make himself heard over a chorus of boos and whistles . reaffirms reform course despite the inhospitable reception , schröder reaffirmed his intention to push through the changes he deems key to reigniting germany ’ s stalled economy and saving its generous welfare system . “ those who believe it ’ s enough simply to hold on to what we ’ ve already got don ’ t understand the challenges , ” he said in his speech to 3,000 people .
“ i ’ m convinced that our agenda is the path we must take . ” opponents to schröder ’ s reforms hope the may 1 labor marches under the motto “ reforms yes – social cuts no thanks ! ” can cause the government to alter its course .
at demonstrations across the country union leaders stepped up their rhetorical attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer “ what we want is not the deconstruction of the social system , but rather a socially just reconstruction , ” said head of the german trade union federation michael sommer , who spoke after schröder in neu-anspach .
“ whoever wants to successfully modernize has to know that it can only work on a basis of social justice . ” threat to resign in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing spd members of parliament , schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support his reform course .
the party ’ s leadership voted to back the government ’ s proposals at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 , but left-wing hardliners have vowed to force a showdown over the painful reforms . the internal spd rebellion heightens the importance of the may 1 demonstrations , since the government doesn ’ t want to see the hardliner ’ s hand strengthened by having anti-reform sentiment spill over into the general populace . “ we will do all we can to keep these measures from becoming political reality , ” said klaus zwickel , head of engineering union ig metall , at a may day rally in bielefeld . complicating matters even further , schröder and the spd reformers will have to make sure - if they win - that the left-wing and the unions aren ’ t alienated from the party , which could jeopardize their political support in future elections . some observers believe the unions will have little choice but eventually to go along with the government ’ s reforms for fear of isolating themselves and minimizing their future input on policy decisions .
but on thursday , organized labor was pulling no punches . “ i expect that on may 1 and over the coming weeks many people will make clear that they expected different policies from this government , ” frank bsirke , leader of services trade union verdi , told ndr radio . walking a fine line schröder therefore will have to tread a fine line on thursday as he attends rallies with top union leaders .
that means he will most likely stick to tried and true themes of social justice , while leaving the political ankle-biting to others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse bundestag president and spd parliamentarian wolfgang thierse took on the rebels on wednesday , saying the party could stray from the reform course only at its own peril . “ the social democrats have no alternative - the price would be -lrb- our -rrb- very survival , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . business leaders also supported schröder ’ s plans ahead of the organized labor ’ s big day on thursday .

controversial american artist jeff koons is to build a huge art installation above hamburg 's sex and entertainment district . jeff koons , the american-born former stockbroker turned artist , is to reinvent a public square in hamburg 's red light district . koons - famous for making sculptures of himself having sex with his ex-wife , a porn star and former italian politician , - will build the massive art installation above the reeperbahn , -lrb- rope walk -rrb- in the free hanseatic city 's st. pauli quarter , which boasts numerous sex theaters , bars and restaurants . a rope moustache and multicolored swim rings koons design reflects just exactly what goes on in a part of town where one visitor commented " some women will just come up to you and offer you a ride . "
two 110-meter -lrb- 361 foot -rrb- tall cranes will be erected above the square , which will hold a massive moustache-shaped rope creation .
onto that , koons plans to slip two 20-meter high multicolored swim rings . " the square is big , " jeff koons said .
" it needs something dramatic . " the installation - which will cost around € 5 million -lrb- $ 5.6 million -rrb- - will also include huge white seaman 's knots , a reminder of the rope-making which used to go on on the reeperbahn in the 19th century , before the sex workers and bar owners arrived . the city-state of hamburg will pick up part of the tab , with private sponsors paying for the rest . never shy of beating his own drum , koons -lrb- " i really believe i 'm going to be a major , major player in end-of-the-century art " -rrb- is convinced his work will be a hit .
as the plans were unveiled on tuesday , the 48-year-old declared the installation would be " one of the most important pieces of art in the 21st century . "
he said he hoped the piece would be comparable to the acropolis and the eiffel tower . hamburg senator mario mettbach said the installation " would finally help to bring back meaning to the historic square . " a controversial choice koons ' design was chosen after the french artist nikki de saint phalle - who was due to revamp the square - died .
although his work has already been shown in berlin , koons is nonetheless a surprising choice for the north german port city , which is renowned for its conservatism . born in pennsylvania in 1955 , koons began his career as a cotton trader on the new york stock exchange , a job he used to finance his burgeoning art career in the late 1970s . as well as making art which explores the themes of spirituality and death , koons is famous for entering the realms of pop culture and focusing heavily on sex . in the late 1980s , koons made sculptures and prints of himself and his former wife , ilona staller , in various sexual positions .
he is also known for sculpting michael jackson and his pet monkey , bubbles , in ceramic and gold . generation x author douglas coupland , who studied at art school with koons , has called him " a liberating figure , " someone " who gave artists the permission to use pop culture byproducts in previously forbidden ways .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.05.2003 germany 's fischer touted for top eu foreign policy job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first eu foreign minister ?
german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .

in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell . though many german politicians have lately suffered persona non grata status in washington diplomatic circles , the country 's leading law enforcement officials scored highly in the u.s. state department 's annual report on the battle against international terror - getting positive marks for their investigative efforts , arrests and convictions of known terrorists .
the report , released earlier this week , describes germany as " an active and critically important participant in the global coalition against terrorism " adding that its contributions have been " valuable " to fighting terrorists both in and outside of germany .
among the chief contributions cited by the report were germany 's deployment of troops for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan as well as the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which followed it .
more than 100 german special forces soldiers participated in the war in afghanistan , and 50 troops trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical weapon detection were dispatched to kuwait in the run-up to the iraq war .
close to 1,800 german troops participated in anti-terrorism activities in the horn of africa region and , most recently , germany and holland took over leadership of the isaf force in february , increasing the number of german soldiers in afghanistan to 2,500 .
the report also focused on the contributions made by law enforcement officials in the fight against terror .
" cooperation between -lrb- german federal interior -rrb- minister schily and u.s. attorney general john ashcroft as well as homeland defense secretary tom ridge are very good , " interior ministry spokesman dirk inger told dw-world .
" they have a very close relationship and work together very well . "
inger , however , would not comment on the specifics of the report .
in the months following the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , german authorities have arrested a handful of terror suspects with apparent roles in supporting the hamburg terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the deadly attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in sept .
2001 .
agents from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and america 's fbi are among the 600 officers investigating the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigative team , which is running 130 separate probes into islamist terrorist activity , is the largest in germany 's history .
the cooperation has also produced tangible results - a handful of which were highlighted in the state department report .
first 9/11 conviction following his arrest in november 2001 , a hamburg court convicted 29-year-old moroccan student mounir al motassadeq in february on charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases in the u.s. attacks , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
it was the first major conviction of a sept .
11-linked terrorist in the wake of the attacks .
german authorities , led by the agencies affiliated with the federal interior ministry , made additional progress in stopping other suspected al qaeda terrorists , the report noted . in april , police arrested five suspected members of the al qaeda-linked al tawhid organization , who are now awaiting indictment .
in addition kay nehm , germany 's chief federal prosecutor , told the newsmagazine der spiegel in february that the government is preparing to press charges against morroccan-born abdelghani mzoudi for his alleged support of the hamburg terror cell .
in addition to maintaining what prosecutors described as a close friendship with motassadeq , mzoudi is also believed to have supplied zakariya essabar , a highly sought after suspected al qaeda terrorist , with money to attend a flight school in the u.s. the state department report cited mzoudi 's arrest last october as a positive development in the fight against terror .
thwarted attack the state department report also cited the success of german police in thwarting a possible terrorist attack against a u.s. military base in heidelberg last september on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11 .
police there arrested a turkish man and an american woman who were found with a large amount of bombmaking materials in their apartment .
the report also praised germany for agreeing to provide the u.s. government with evidence in its trial against zacarias moussaoui , a french national who investigators believed intended to be the 19th hijacker in the plots against new york and washington .
the exchange of evidence relating to moussaoui proved problematic initially due to germany 's strong opposition to the death penalty , which is enshrined in the country 's laws relating to giving evidence or extraditing suspects to countries where they might face capital punishment .
in one of its few statements critical of german policy , the state department noted : " strong german opposition to the u.s. death penalty has complicated efforts to forge a mutual legal assistance treaty with the united states , but negotiations are continuing . "
strengthening security the discovery that the sept .
11 terrorist attacks were planned in their own backyard by a hamburg cell of al qaeda rattled germany .

german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister . an eu constitutional convention led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing last week presented a blueprint for reforming the union ’ s major institutions in time for its expansion by 10 new countries next year . besides revamping the eu ’ s rotating presidency and streamlining the european commission , one of the convention ’ s key proposals calls for the creation of a european foreign minister to conduct the bloc 's common foreign , security and defense policies . and although the job doesn ’ t yet exist , germany 's joschka fischer , who has made no secret that he yearns for a wider international stage , is already being touted for the position . “ more than anything europe needs a foreign policy engine room , led by a european foreign minister , ” luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker told the reutlinger generalanzeiger newspaper in an interview on friday .
“ -lrb- fischer -rrb- would be an excellent choice for it . ” international limelight despite being consistently rated as germany ’ s most popular politician , fischer does n't seem content to stick to the domestic political scene .
as germany took the presidency of the u.n. security council earlier this year at the height of the iraq crisis , it was clear the leading politician from the green party relished the international limelight . with his strong federalist credentials , a top foreign policy job in brussels would appear to fit perfectly with fischer ’ s ambitions .
indeed , shortly after taking over the helm of the german foreign office in 1999 , he made clear he hoped to eventually make his job “ superfluous , by replacing it with a european foreign minister . ” crucial to determining to fischer ’ s future professional plans could be a meeting of eu foreign ministers on the greek island of rhodes this weekend .
besides discussing a recent controversial defense summit attended by four eu members , the politicians are also expected to stake out positions for the constitutional convention , which will offer its proposals in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer on rhodes , greece .
“ this informal meeting allows us to have a real open debate , let off some steam and delve into the issues in much greater depth , " greek foreign minister george papandreou told the reuters news agency . backing from abroad according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the german foreign ministry is already working out under what conditions fischer - who reportedly already has backing from britain and france - would be prepared to leave berlin for the top diplomatic post in brussels . in an attempt to avoid future internal eu divisions over issues such as the war in iraq , giscard and others have proposed endowing the foreign minister position with considerable power and funding .
the candidate would likely be chosen by eu leaders but would have a seat on the executive european commission .
the job would also meld the posts held by eu external affairs commissioner chris patten and javier solana , the union ’ s representative for foreign policy . a “ european foreign office ” with a beefed up budget would then control the 300 officials currently under patten .
the roughly 130 eu offices around the world would also be upgraded to embassies . but such grand schemes could quickly fall apart if eu states are unable to stay united over divisive foreign policy issues such as iraq . fischer , perhaps realizing this , remains coy when asked directly about his ambitions , remarking only that he is “ quite happy ” at the foreign ministry in berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu meeting to discuss joint security and defense foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east .

low staffing at the jail - managed by securicor custodial services - meant that prison officers had to unlock inmates single-handedly , a practice considered as unsafe .

in the english local council elections , no more than one in three voters went to the polls , although turnout was boosted in areas using all-postal votes .
opponents of devolution will also try to draw capital from the voting numbers for the scottish parliament and welsh assembly polls .
in the welsh elections , turnout was down by about 10 % on 1999 - with apparently no more than 38 % of voters making it to the ballot boxes .
the picture was better in scotland , but there the turnout looked to have dipped below 50 % , down about 8 points on last time .
postal boost new methods of voting were trialled in many local councils in an attempt to make voting easier .
electoral commission figures suggest turnout in districts using all-postal ballots averaged 44 % , up 10 points on the last elections in those areas .
but there were problems in st albans , one of 17 councils offering e-voting .
glitches with onscreen voting in polling booths meant officers had to manually check that those who wanted to vote electronically in the booths had not already voted at home .
the system failed to recognise the pin number given to the electorate to prevent them from voting twice , but the council did manage to declare its results in the early hours .
according to a bbc survey on average there was a 20 point increase in the turnout in those wards using an all postal ballot .
internet voting in advance of the election may have resulted in a slightly improved turnout where this facility was available but has once again proven far less effective at increasing turnout than all postal ballots .

brynle williams from cilcain near mold in flintshire failed to come first in the clwyd west constituency , but won his ticket to cardiff bay through the north wales regional list .
when he announced his intention to stand in the election in june 2001 , mr williams said he did not know whether it would be as an independent or for one of the main parties .
in the end he opted for the conservative party .
the married father of two has said he wanted to be a champion for north wales and rural issues .
mr williams rose to prominence as a spokesman for farmers protesting at the stanlow oil refinery in ellesmere port , cheshire , nearly three years ago .
they wanted the government to recognise the harm they believed was being done to rural communities and hauliers by fuel taxes that pushed the price of petrol much higher in the uk than in europe .
the group picketed the site for seven days and the action sparked similar protests at oil sites around the country .
although the demonstrations caused panic buying and many petrol stations ran out of fuel , there was wide public support .
mr williams has been involved in previous protests by welsh farmers , including lively demonstrations at holyhead where irish beef was dumped into the sea .
the tough-talking sheep and cattle farmer has accused the labour government in westminster of forgetting wales and being mainly concerned with london .
he said he was hoping to redress the balance when he took his seat in cardiff bay .
