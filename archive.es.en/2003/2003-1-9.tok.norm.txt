but the media has stopped playing by his rules - and he is n't happy about it . for years , germany 's leaders could practically do whatever they wanted behind closed doors and did n't have to fear reading about it in the country 's tabloids the next morning .
but now , the decades of an unspoken pact in which journalists treated politicians ' private lives with discretion appear to be nearing an end .
the prominent victim of this development is none other than chancellor gerhard schröder , who usually relishes public attention .
he is furious after several german newspapers reprinted a story from britain 's mail on sunday which claimed that schröder 's fourth marriage is in trouble .
the chancellor 's lawyers have now warned the media of legal action against anyone who reprinted these allegations .
the personalization of politics in the most recent issue of the weekly news magazine spiegel , schröder complains of the media 's lacking respect for privacy .
but could he be bearing the brunt of a trend he himself supported ?
schröder , who calls himself the " media chancellor " , is a prime example of a person being used to make politics .
the media interest in politicians ' private lives is a result of this personalization of politics , says dr. ralph weiss of the hans-bredow-institut for media research in hamburg .
" politicians are increasingly appearing on television talk shows and using this media space , where it 's not about their politics , but about their person , " he told dw-world in an interview .
" politicians like this .
they can sell themselves well , without having to answer hard-hitting questions . "
part of the territory weiss explains that this development is based on the general trend of public intimacy .
" people are increasingly divulging their personal lives in the media , " he says .
the success of reality television , such as big brother or court tv , showed this .
politicians have used this trend of revealing their " personal side " as a political strategy .
" but the risk of this is that once you start , you ca n't steer where it 's going to go , " says weiss .
" they 're playing a media game , which they ca n't control . "
according to the german journalists association djv , schröder should n't be surprised that media are exploiting a system which he himself created .
djv 's chairman rolf lautenbach told german radio deutschlandfunk that other standards applied in this case .
when a leader all but fixes the party platform to his person , he should n't wonder that journalists are more interested in this person than usual , lautenbach said .
he added that schröder 's attempts to legally hinder such reports were " wrong " .

but the media has stopped playing by his rules - and he is n't happy about it . for years , germany 's leaders could practically do whatever they wanted behind closed doors and did n't have to fear reading about it in the country 's tabloids the next morning .
but now , the decades of an unspoken pact in which journalists treated politicians ' private lives with discretion appear to be nearing an end .
the prominent victim of this development is none other than chancellor gerhard schröder , who usually relishes public attention .
he is furious after several german newspapers reprinted a story from britain 's mail on sunday which claimed that schröder 's fourth marriage is in trouble .
the chancellor 's lawyers have now warned the media of legal action against anyone who reprinted these allegations .
the personalization of politics in the most recent issue of the weekly news magazine spiegel , schröder complains of the media 's lacking respect for privacy .
but could he be bearing the brunt of a trend he himself supported ?
schröder , who calls himself the " media chancellor " , is a prime example of a person being used to make politics .
the media interest in politicians ' private lives is a result of this personalization of politics , says dr. ralph weiss of the hans-bredow-institut for media research in hamburg .
" politicians are increasingly appearing on television talk shows and using this media space , where it 's not about their politics , but about their person , " he told dw-world in an interview .
" politicians like this .
they can sell themselves well , without having to answer hard-hitting questions . "
part of the territory weiss explains that this development is based on the general trend of public intimacy .
" people are increasingly divulging their personal lives in the media , " he says .
the success of reality television , such as big brother or court tv , showed this .
politicians have used this trend of revealing their " personal side " as a political strategy .
" but the risk of this is that once you start , you ca n't steer where it 's going to go , " says weiss .
" they 're playing a media game , which they ca n't control . "
according to the german journalists association djv , schröder should n't be surprised that media are exploiting a system which he himself created .
djv 's chairman rolf lautenbach told german radio deutschlandfunk that other standards applied in this case .
when a leader all but fixes the party platform to his person , he should n't wonder that journalists are more interested in this person than usual , lautenbach said .

six joint nhs / military hospitals in england , employing at least 1,000 regular army members , could be affected .
the six employ members of the army , navy and air force who work as nhs staff .
but they can be called up for exercises or conflict at any time .
the hospitals are : derriford park , plymouth frimley park , surrey peterborough hospital queen alexandra hospital , portsmouth south tees , -lrb- formerly northallerton -rrb- , middlesborough university hospital birmingham -lrb- formerly queen elizabeth 's -rrb- spare capacity a meeting of the hospitals ' chief executives was held at the department of health in london on thursday to help them plan for the loss of staff .
any call-up could create a significant hole in each hospital 's staffing , though it is unlikely all medical regulars would be deployed at once . "
inevitably in a state of war there are serious consequences not only for those involved in the war but also for those at home " british medical association spokesman for example , frimley park hospital has 241 army personnel working as doctors , nurses and healthcare assistants , out of a total staff of 5,000 .
south tees has 180 army personnel working there .
peterborough hospital , which has close links with the navy , has 200 military personnel working there , including 10 consultants , out of a staff of 3,000 .
they will be advised to book cover for absent staff , and talk to neighbouring hospitals to see if there is spare capacity they can make use of .
peterborough hospital has in the past used local gps in a & e and asked recently retired consultants to work for short periods .
shortage a spokesman for the department of health told bbc news online : " in normal peacetime , there would be these meetings .
" but everyone sees the situation on the horizon . "

dr christopher parnell , a consultant anaesthetist and a member of the reserves , -lrb- people who formerly served in the forces -rrb- , said a large call-up would affect on the nhs .
he told the bbc : " the impact on the nhs 's performance is difficult to quantify , because we do n't know how many surgeons , how many anaesthetists , indeed how many nhs personnel will be involved . "
dr parnell said some areas could find it difficult to find staff to stand in for those who are deployed .
" anaesthetists , for example , are in short supply ; in the nhs , in the services and in the reserve forces as well . "
a spokesman for the british medical association said : " inevitably in a state of war there are serious consequences not only for those involved in the war but also for those at home .
" this is compounded by the shortage of doctors both in the armed forces and in the nhs .
" our troops abroad need our full medical support and this will have an effect on non-urgent care for nhs patients at home . "

" the us consumers are discovering wine , " said lawrie stanford , the awbc 's information and analysis manager .
" traditionally the us has been a beer and spirits nation , but they are coming to the wine experience . "
he added that the figures defy the slowdown in the us and global economies and the recent exchange rate fluctuations by the australian dollar .
australian red was a particular favourite of us drinkers , accounting for almost three quarters of the growth .
top drop wine exports totalled a $ 2.3 billion dollars -lrb- £ 822.9m ; $ 1.3bn -rrb- in 2002 , an increase of a $ 531m on the previous year , the awbc figures showed .
britain imports about a $ 902m worth , or about 40 % of exports , but the market is beginning to plateau , while canada is in third place .
" we 've got away with it for a few years but competition is hotting up in the uk , " mr stanford said .
australia is the world 's fourth largest wine exporter , supplying about 7 % of the global market behind france , italy and spain .
wine exports by volume in 2002 were 471 million litres , including an all-time monthly high of 52.1 million litres in september .

however , fewer drivers involved in collisions provided positive breath tests .
police stopped 11 people found to be driving whilst unfit through drugs - 5.2 % of those committing offences .
four of the arrests were made by north wales police which introduced a scheme last year which trains officers how to detect and prosecute drug-driving offences .
of the four welsh police forces , only north wales police recorded a drop in the number those caught drink-driving .
across north wales , 58 people were caught driving while over the legal limit of alcohol compared to 77 over the same period last year .

" this behaviour is totally unacceptable . "
gwent police assistant chief constable , bill horne , added : " it is sad to see that 265 drivers were so unconcerned with their own safety and that of others , that they were willing to indulge in the criminal use of their vehicles . "

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- n korea agrees to talks with seoul bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point thursday , 9 january , 2003 , 08:17 gmt n korea agrees to talks with seoul north korea has agreed to hold talks with the south korean government , at which seoul says it will put pressure on the north over its nuclear programme .
the meeting will be the latest in a series of rapprochement talks between the two sides since their historic summit in 2000 , but the bbc correspondent in seoul says the timing is highly significant .
the ministerial-level meeting will be the first since north korea began reactivating a nuclear plant , which is believed to be capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
but so far , the stalinist north has made no response to a us offer of talks , or to demands by the united nations nuclear watchdog to allow its inspectors - expelled last week - back into the country .
south korean officials said the north had proposed starting the four-day meeting on 21 january - a week later than the south had suggested .
but our correspondent , caroline gluck , says south korea will be relieved the talks are going ahead at all .
president kim dae-jung and his government believe dialogue is the best way to tackle the nuclear controversy .
south korean officials have been engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity around the world , hoping to resolve the crisis peacefully .
a recent success was washington 's renewed readiness to talk to north korea .
the us had earlier said it would not engage in dialogue unless pyongyang first scrapped its nuclear programme .
but after talks with south korean and japanese diplomats , it reversed its decision .
international concerns south korean officials have said they will use the meeting with the north to raise international concerns about pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions , and to urge the north to dismantle its nuclear programme .
south korea 's national security adviser , yim sung-joon , said on wednesday that the us had endorsed his plan to utilise the south 's existing channels of dialogue with the north to resolve the stand-off .
north korea accuses washington of planning to use the north 's decision to reactivate the nuclear facility at yongbyon as an excuse for a pre-emptive nuclear attack .
crisis chronology 16 oct : n korea acknowledges secret nuclear programme , us says 14 nov : oil shipments to n korea halted 22 dec : n korea removes monitoring devices at yongbyon nuclear plant 26 dec : un says 1,000 fuel rods have been moved to the plant 31 dec : un nuclear inspectors leave north korea 6 jan : iaea demands inspectors be readmitted and secret weapons programme halted 7 jan : us " willing to talk " to north korea pyongyang has called on the us to sign a pact promising not to attack the north , even though washington has repeatedly said it has no intention of invading .
us secretary of state colin powell struck a conciliatory tone during an interview recorded this week with public radio international .
" we recognise that north korea is a country in difficult economic straits , and we want to help , " he said .
" but in order for the international community to help , they -lsb- the north koreans -rsb- have to forswear their efforts to develop a nuclear bomb . "
white house spokesman ari fleischer said on wednesday that " the ball is in north korea 's court now to respond " to the us talks offer .
analysts believe that north korea 's nuclear activity could simply be a diplomatic gambit designed to extract political and economic concessions from the us .
but mr fleischer warned that the north " should certainly not expect the united states to give them additional inducements to honour old agreements " .
