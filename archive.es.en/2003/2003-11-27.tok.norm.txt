the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .
" because unfortunately in referendums other things tend to play a role instead of the actual topic itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sticky negotiations over eu constitution continue the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .

between 30 and 40 students share one classroom , which is about 40 square meters -lrb- 430 square feet -rrb- in size .
about 300 students attend each school . clear guidelines for the construction of schools cap anamur , a cologne-based charity organization , has set clear school construction guidelines for local authorities : both a boys and a girls school have to be constructed .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .
the new encyclopaedia serves as a reminder that in fact , active resistance to the third reich was few and far between . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria faces its nazi past the austrian historical commission , established to document austrian participation in nazi crimes , has delivered its final report .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .
" because unfortunately in referendums other things tend to play a role instead of the actual topic itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sticky negotiations over eu constitution continue the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2003 jewish family wins landmark legal battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a street sign in memory of the former jewish owners in what proved to be one of germany 's most contentious litigations concerning the restitution of jewish property , a family of german jews has won a key ruling . the federal administrative court in leipzig ordered that authorities return a property near berlin to the heirs of a jewish family , on the grounds that it was sold under pressure from the nazis 67 years ago .
wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .

the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .

the bank ’ s current chief executive , johannes ringel , is one of the names mentioned in the widening affair .
ringel took over from jurgen sengera as ceo after the latter was forced out by the regulatory probe conducted by bafin , the federal institution for finance service supervision .
westlb is being investigated after losses arose at boxclever from a € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.02 billion , £ 748 million -rrb- securitization financed by the bank 's london unit .
the crisis will come to a head in january when the public prosecutor in düsseldorf will decide whether to go for indictments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2003 cream-colored cabs soon a thing of the past ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cream-colored wherever you go : german taxis all german taxis have been cream-colored for more than two decades .
but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .

the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .

donations from people around the world have already helped deutsche welle and cap anamur build 48 classrooms in afghanistan .
but help is still needed in order to reach the goal of 100 classrooms . many people around the globe have already donated to the “ 100 classrooms for afghanistan “ fundraising campaign .
the dedication of dw-tv viewers , dw-radio listeners and dw-world readers has been overwhelming . for example , students and teachers at the german school of the sisters of mercy of st. borromeo in cairo organized a gala for its centennial and raised more than € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,190 -rrb- .
bfe , a germany-based company that builds recording studios for deutsche welle , donated € 10,000 -lrb- € 11,900 -rrb- .
the wife of germany ’ s consul general in los angeles is organizing a benefit event for the campaign . many thanks to all who have donated .
but there is still a ways to go to reach the goal of building 100 classrooms . since deutsche welle started the worldwide fundraising drive , its partner organization cap anamur has constructed 48 classrooms in afghanistan .
the six new schools each contain eight classrooms , teacher rooms and administration offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workmen building a school in novobod erected in the towns of novobod , jamchi , yanqiqala , laclacond , sardcomar and baharak , each school took two to three months to construct .
between 30 and 40 students share one classroom , which is about 40 square meters -lrb- 430 square feet -rrb- in size .
about 300 students attend each school . clear guidelines for the construction of schools cap anamur , a cologne-based charity organization , has set clear school construction guidelines for local authorities : both a boys and a girls school have to be constructed .
the two schools have to share a patio .
teachers have to be paid directly by the municipal government .
this way , deutsche welle helps to improve afghanistan ’ s education system .
girls and young women especially need this support as they could not attend schools during the taliban regime . afghan children need more than just classrooms , however .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .

" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .
" because unfortunately in referendums other things tend to play a role instead of the actual topic itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sticky negotiations over eu constitution continue the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original .

but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .
" because unfortunately in referendums other things tend to play a role instead of the actual topic itself .

though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .
the new encyclopaedia serves as a reminder that in fact , active resistance to the third reich was few and far between . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria faces its nazi past the austrian historical commission , established to document austrian participation in nazi crimes , has delivered its final report .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2003 jewish family wins landmark legal battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a street sign in memory of the former jewish owners in what proved to be one of germany 's most contentious litigations concerning the restitution of jewish property , a family of german jews has won a key ruling . the federal administrative court in leipzig ordered that authorities return a property near berlin to the heirs of a jewish family , on the grounds that it was sold under pressure from the nazis 67 years ago .
wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .
the new encyclopaedia serves as a reminder that in fact , active resistance to the third reich was few and far between . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de austria faces its nazi past the austrian historical commission , established to document austrian participation in nazi crimes , has delivered its final report .

in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .
instead he 's become the president of the berlin-based tvd taxi drivers ' association .
his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .
1 to test people 's reactions to the change .
" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .
the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen bugs are used as taxis in mexico city .
while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .
safety issues but it 's a trademark that is easily acquired by anyone who wants to , meaning that the feeling of safety associated with an " official " cream-colored cab could be jeopardized , said cabbie isabella weidhaas . she used to drive cabs in the eastern city of erfurt , where cabs came in all colors before reunification .

instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .

while many still oppose the plans , others would welcome the change .
" personally i do n't have anything against it , " said karl-heinz frantzen , a cab driving veteran from cologne .
" the buses here now also come in pretty colors . "
frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .
even london 's distinctive " black cabs " now come in red , blue or white as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taxis in london besides , no one 's trying to force people to let go of ivory .
" we do n't want to get rid of the color , " kristan said .
" everyone who wants to will be able to keep using it .
we just think it 's unfair that we 're forced to use a single color .
imagine if all bakers had to paint their store fronts brown and all butchers had to paint them red . "
he added that the black and yellow taxi sign on car roofs will always remain a cab 's true trademark .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .
" according to the law , there must be sufficient evidence showing that the legal transaction would have occurred even had the national socialists not been in power " , judge oswin müller said , adding that " in this case , circumstantial evidence and inferences are not enough .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .

there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .

mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .

but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions on friday . light ivory , as the german cab color is accurately called , has been mandatory for taxis since 1980 .
that year , all taxi drivers had to abandon black as the standard paint for their cars and switch to the opposite end of the spectrum .
" i was there when it happened , " said peter kristan , who drove cabs at the time .
" i never had a problem with people not recognizing me . "
kristan no longer cruises the streets on the look-out for passengers .

his organization supports the proposal to liberalize the color scheme for cabs and is part of a pilot program in stuttgart .
there , black and silver-gray cabs have been granted exemptions since oct .

" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .
" the drivers i talked to said they do n't see any drawbacks , " he said .

he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .

" most do n't even realize they 're sitting in a taxi that 's a different color , " kristan said , adding that many taxi companies support a free color scheme because it 's easier to sell cars after they 're done being cabs .

the end of a trademark ?
he probably has n't talked to wilfried martini , who 's been driving stuttgarters in a silver-gray minivan for the past two months .
a taxi driver for more than 30 years , martini has n't warmed up to the new color .
" i think this is complete nonsense , " he said .
" i ca n't think of another company that deliberately destroys its trademark . "
instead of introducing new cab colors , the country 's 25,000 taxi companies should support making light ivory a registered trademark .
as things are now , anyone can drive a car in that color , martini said .
it 's an idea that 's also favored by members of germany 's other taxi association , the frankfurt-based bzp .
last june , that group sent a thank-you letter to german transport minister manfred stolpe , who has come out in favor of keeping a uniform taxi look .
" this is not just about keeping a valuable corporate identity for our trade , " hans meißner , bzp 's president , wrote at the time .
" a significant drop in quality of service would be a medium term consequence of a liberalization as well . "
opponents of the change argue that color liberalization would make it much easier for black sheep to enter the market .
tackling red tape officials in the german states of lower saxony and saarland see things differently and will now put the matter before their colleagues in the bundesrat .
they see the color restriction in terms of costly red tape , which ties up government officials ' time for no reason .
" why does the government have to regulate such nonsense ? " asked andreas krischat , a spokesman for lower saxony 's transport ministry .
his saarland colleague agreed that the cab color debate is a sign of german reluctance to initiate reforms .
" this shows how difficult it is to deregulate things here , " said philipp britz from saarland 's economy ministry , which also handles transport issues .
britz added that his government , which has been granting color exemptions since last year , wants to give cab drivers the opportunity to avoid the costly light ivory paint job and create their own taxi associations with a cab color unique to them , as is the case with new york city 's yellow cabs or the white and green beetle taxis in mexico city .

frantzen said he does n't understand why some of his colleagues worry about losing customers because they would n't recognize them as cab drivers any longer .
" if i 'm in spain , i can still find a taxi , " he said .
cab uniformity all but gone in europe in fact , only one other european union country still has a mandatory color for its taxis : portugal adopted germany 's light ivory in time for the world exhibition in lisbon in 1998 , according to kristan from the tvd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2003 jewish family wins landmark legal battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a street sign in memory of the former jewish owners in what proved to be one of germany 's most contentious litigations concerning the restitution of jewish property , a family of german jews has won a key ruling . the federal administrative court in leipzig ordered that authorities return a property near berlin to the heirs of a jewish family , on the grounds that it was sold under pressure from the nazis 67 years ago .
wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .

wolfgang ewer , the lawyer for the jewish association that brought the case before the courts , described the ruling as " a positive contribution to overcoming , in judicial terms , germany 's darkest chapter " .
a legal precedent the landmark judgement comes a month after the federal administrative court ruled that the jewish claims conference could still win compensation for jewish property seized by the nazis despite the expiration of a december 31 , 1992 deadline for claims by original jewish owners and their heirs .
the ruling sets a new legal precedent and clears the way for some 705 further claims in connection with the sabersky estate being heard simultaneously by a lower court in potsdam .
legally , the properties can remain in the hands of the current owners if acquired " in good faith " after 1945 , in which case the sabersky heirs will receive compensation only .
according to estimates , this is likely to be the case in some 150 of the 705 claims .
" people who have quite a good life today should not forget that their life is often paid for by the loss of property and the loss of life of jews in the 1930s , " irene runge , president of the jewish community council in berlin , told bbc .
" it 's a question of whether people have a feeling for history and whether they will accept that injustice was done between 1933 and 1945 to the jews , " runge added .
voluntary or forced emigration ?
the court overturned earlier rulings which had rejected a claim pertaining to the 200-acre estate in teltow-seehof , brandenburg , brought on behalf of the descendants of max and albert sabersky , who emigrated to the u.s. in 1938 .
it said previous rulings had not considered the conditions under which the land was sold and the role played by the nazi dictatorship in the sale .
in 1933 , the sabersky family had agreed with local authorities to divide the property they 'd owned since 1870 into some 1,000 plots , which were then sold off over the next seven years .
the sabersky heirs made a restitution claim in 1990 , offering to sell the property back to the current owners at a reasonable price .
some 200 agreed , but the remaining 705 argued that there was no proof that the saberskys had sold the estate under duress during the third reich and had in fact planned the sale prior to 1933 .
nazi pressure main reason for sale this week , the federal administrative court in leipzig concluded there was no evidence of reasons for the sale other than pressure from the nazi regime .
wolfgang ewer had argued that the saberskys sold their land specifically because they felt their future in germany was imperiled by the growing discrimination against jews .
the court accepted that nazi persecution was partially responsible for the sale of the property .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .
the majority vote proposal would replace the current unanimous vote on eu foreign policy decisions , effectively removing national vetoes .
london does not want the eu making foreign policy decisions on its behalf .
much ado about a constitution the tussle is one of many confronting the 25 governments of the expanded european union two weeks ahead of an important summit in brussels .
there , heads of european governments hope to pass the heavily-discussed draft of the document that will plot the course of an expanded europe at the december summit .
small and new member nations are fighting against bigger countries for more seats on the policy-initiating european commission .
secular countries have been pitted against religious ones on whether to mention god in the preamble to the constitution , and now the power of the future eu foreign minister has boiled to the top .
" it 's not normal that we have a government conference where in every sitting , more questions arise than are solved , " an exasperated eu commissioner for expansion günter verheugen told the european parliament this week .
mikado-like waiting game countries from germany to eu newlings poland or lithuania have proposed 90 amendments or changes to the constitution .
the european secretary in germany 's chancellor 's office , martin bury , has called the standoff a mikado-like game of waiting until the other side gives in .
but alliances between countries like spain and poland or france and germany in the past weeks and months are sure to set up some spectacular roadblocks to compromise .
spain and poland , awarded a large voting share disproportionate to the size of their countries by an earlier eu treaty , are fighting against france and germany , who want that share taken away under the new constitution .
smaller nations , like austria , are fighting rigorously to make sure their voice is heard in the expanded europe .
the current draft calls for the seats on the european commission to be increased to 25 – one for each country – but would give only 15 voting powers .
hope for foreign policy , clouds on the horizon european politicians are hoping that the two-day conference will at the very least iron out loose threads in the foreign policy arena .
at the moment , europe has two officials who speak on foreign affairs topics but wield no real power .
the constitution wants to merge the two into one minister who will give an expanded europe more political weight in foreign policy questions .
" the important thing is that the key questions in foreign policy are solved in naples , " elmar brok , european parliamentarian , told the german daily die welt .
" the european foreign minister post will need to be specified ... without limitations . "
there is another cloud looming on the horizon .
should government leaders agree on the constitution , it will need to be ratified by their countries .
in some cases , that means putting it before a vote of the people .
" in those places that are holding referendums – denmark , ireland and some of the middle european countries – the danger -lrb- of failing ratification -rrb- is especially big , " said brok .
" because unfortunately in referendums other things tend to play a role instead of the actual topic itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sticky negotiations over eu constitution continue the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday . a last-minute italian proposal to give a future european union foreign minister more power was dismissively shot down by great britain ahead of the meeting .
foreign minister jack straw told british parliamentarians thursday that " we will resist " the proposal that would introduce a majority voting scheme on foreign policy decisions made by the european union .
great britain , followed by france , is the fiercest opponent of plans by more federalist states like germany and greece to create a strong eu foreign minister position .

the " international encyclopaedia of german studies scholars " has triggered a national debate on the nazi past of several high-profile scholars , and it has n't even been published yet . reseachers have discovered that many influential post-war academics were registered as members of the nazi party between 1933 and 1945 .
prominent intellectuals such as profesor emeritus at the university of tübingen walter jens and peter wapnewski , founder of the berlin institute for advanced study , have found themselves at the heart of a controversy which many say puts 20th century german studies in a whole new light .
encyclopaedia of german scholars publication of a new academic reference work does n't normally make headlines , but this one has proved highly inflammatory .
in early december , walter de gruyter is set to publish the internationale germanistenlexikon 1800-1950 .
seven years in the making , it 's a three-volume , 2300-page encyclopaedia with 1500 entries on german studies scholars from 44 countries , edited by christoph könig .
back in 1972 , the center for research into the history of german studies was set up by the schiller society at the renowned german literature archive in marbach , with an initial aim of exploring the role of german studies scholars in the nazi era .
the project was soon extended to cover from 1800 to the mid 20th century .
memory lapses their research soon led the editorial team to the federal archive in berlin , which includes an index of nsdap members .
astonishingly , it featured the names of many high-profile german scholars , including walter jens , peter wapnewski , arthur henkel and walter höllerer , who died earlier this year .
when the revelation surfaced , könig turned to historian michael buddrus , who told him that at least one signed application was required for registration as a party member .
but both jens and wapnewski say they have no recollection of signing applications to the party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wapnewski admits his hitler youth leader may have registered him with the nsdap in 1938 in the newspaper die zeit , wapnewski -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that all he could say for certain was that in 1938 , " my hitler youth leader told me he wanted to register me with the nsdap . but then nothing more happened . "
six months later , wapnewski was called up .
" i was sure that nothing had ever come of the hitler youth leader 's suggestion , " he says .
" no official ever informed either me or my family that i was a member of the party . "
coming to terms with the past wapnewski resists the idea that post-war german studies need be reappraised in the light of the revelations , saying that " the fact that at the age of 18 , jens and höllerer may have been pushed into joining the party or even done so of their own free will has nothing whatsoever to do with their later academic achievements , which are hopefully to their credit . "
the daily newspaper f.a.z . points out that jens , for example , has built a career on the principle of germany 's need to come to terms with its past .
while president of the berlin arts academy between 1989 and 1997 , jens was a vocal critic of colleagues accused of involvement with the east german secret service .
it now transpires that this leading intellectual may not have adequately reflected on his own past .
in an interview with news agency dpa , jens dismissed the allegations as banal , saying he may once have " signed some slip of paper " but insisting he had a " clear conscience " .
he admits " i was not a resistance fighter , i was in the hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein in uniform gekleideter junge , mitglied der nationalsozialistischen hitlerjugend , beim schlagen seiner trommel -lrb- undatierte aufnahme - propagandafoto . -rrb-
youth movement , i was 19 years old , " and suggests that the hitler youth movement may have registered members with the party without their knowledge .
" i have to know what happened in my past before i can out myself about it , " he said .
könig , the editor , agrees that it 's important to distinguish between those born after 1920 and the older generation .
signing an application form at the tender age of 18 does n't make someone an avowed nazi , and for this reason it seems unfair to compare jens ' involvement with that of hans ernst schneider , for example , another leading academic and former soldier with heinrich himmler 's notorious ss .
nonetheless , surveys show that more than 50 percent of germans today believe their families were not sympathetic to the nazi cause .

it plans to shut down dangerous factories and those employing underage workers .
officials admit there has been a resurgence in the illegal production of fireworks and with deadly results .
in the first nine months of the year 209 people were killed in fireworks explosions - an increase of twenty four percent from last year .
but repeated efforts to improve safety in the fireworks industry seem to have had little effect .
there has been an ongoing campaign to try to improve safety in the industry since an explosion in a school two years ago killed 42 people , most of them children .
but making fireworks is a major source of income in the countryside and many families produce fireworks in their own homes - a practice which the government has banned .
enforcing the law is difficult and central directives are often ignored at lower levels .
the xinhua news agency quotes the government as blaming grass-roots officials protecting local industry for the rise in illegal fireworks production .
the announcement of a shake-up in the industry coincides with the arrest of seven people in southern guangxi province in connection with explosions in two illegal fireworks factories which killed 16 people .

it plans to shut down dangerous factories and those employing underage workers .
officials admit there has been a resurgence in the illegal production of fireworks and with deadly results .
in the first nine months of the year 209 people were killed in fireworks explosions - an increase of twenty four percent from last year .
but repeated efforts to improve safety in the fireworks industry seem to have had little effect .
lucrative there has been an ongoing campaign to try to improve safety in the industry since an explosion in a school two years ago killed 42 people , most of them children .

this huge body of paper work , enough to fill a small library , is concrete evidence of the role the eu plays in our lives , whether we know it or not .
if a law is controversial they blame it on brussels kirsty hughes , centre for european policy studies it is estimated that about half the laws enacted in existing member states stem from eu legislation .
in poland , about one-third of parliament 's time over the last three years has been spent catching up and it is still racing to meet the deadline .
" we have passed between 220 and 240 laws , " says the head of the parliament 's europe committee , josef oleksy .
" we have another 30 laws and 150 executive orders to do before 1 may 2004 . "
laws and framework laws there are just over 2,500 eu directives in force at the moment , most of which have been transposed into national law by the member states - the compliance rate ranges between 96 % and 99 % .
the draft eu constitution proposes renaming directives " framework laws " because they describe the effect national legislation must achieve , but leave it up to governments to draft and enforce their own laws .
try yourself !
take the eu law quiz they cover everything from waste disposal to the marketing of explosives and conditions for obtaining boatmasters ' certificates , from intellectual property rights to the veterinary supervision of abattoirs .
the biggest single sub-category is health and consumer protection , followed by law governing enterprises , the internal market , energy and transport , and the environment .
the eu also passes regulations -lrb- to be known in future simply as laws -rrb- which pass directly into national law without modification , but these tend to be of a more technical nature .
all legislation is listed , as it is adopted , in the eu 's official journal .
the journal for wednesday 26 november 2003 lists a regulation governing the use of smoke flavouring in food , and a decision of the european parliament and council of ministers on the use of remote sensing and aerial survey techniques in gathering agricultural statistics between 2004 and 2007 .
there are also three regulations concerned with the day-to-day running of the common agricultural policy .

the eu 's legislative output has slowed since the heady days of the creation of the single market , but the next few months are expected to be quite busy , with the parliament facing elections in june , and the commission due for replacement later in the year .
on some legislation the parliament and the council of ministers -lrb- made up of government ministers from member states -rrb- are already negotiating informally to find compromises that will speed up the process .
up to now eu law making has been a fiendishly complicated business -lrb- though less so since the amsterdam treaty of 1997 -rrb- .
the eu draft constitution , however , introduces a relatively simple " ordinary legislative procedure " intended to apply to most areas of eu activity .
the directives churned out by the eu have also tended to be extremely complicated .
a " less is more " philosophy has been part of the brussels agenda for at least a decade , but it is debatable whether it has born fruit .

the december edition of trail magazine suggests three routes which , it says , are snow-free , even in the depths of winter .
but the british mountaineering council is one of a number of organisations which are writing to the magazine , complaining that the article is factually inaccurate and could put inexperienced walkers at risk .
one of the routes the article recommends is the lairig ghru through the cairngorms - possibly scotland 's most famous mountain pass .
it rises to almost 3,000ft , and goes through wild and stunning scenery between some massive peaks .
the piece says " even the worst winter weather " ca n't spoil the route , and " there will be no deep snow " .
but john allen , leader of the cairngorm mountain rescue team says that is just not true .
he said : " you get snow on the lairig ghru all year round .
in fact , i 've seen snow there in june , in the mid-summer . "
he told me the story of several climbers and walkers his team have had to rescue from chest-high snow on the route - some as late as april .
' serious undertakings ' the other walks featured are on stac pollaidh in the highlands and round great gable in the lake district .
the magazine promises they " guarantee a high time below the snow " and are routes you can do any-time without " the faff " of ice axes and crampons .
but tim walker , the principal of sport scotland 's national mountain training centre at glennmore lodge , said : " all three are quite serious undertakings and certainly could not ever be described as being snow-free year-round . "
he said even if conditions seem to be good anyone attempting any of those routes in the winter should carry a bivouac bag , an ice axe and crampons , and know how to use them .
the editor of trail told me his magazine is written for , and read by , regular hillwalkers .
the magazine 's claims have angered mountaineers he said his readers " do not need dire warnings on every page of the myriad potential dangers which await the unprepared , that the weather is unpredictable , or that conditions in the mountains on the day you want to walk are the ultimate make-or-break factor " .
but that has not reassured the mountaineering council of scotland or the british mountaineering council .
they are both writing to the magazine , complaining that the feature is factually inaccurate and could mislead inexperienced walkers , putting them at risk .
and fergus ewing , the member of the scottish parliament for inverness east - which includes most of the cairngorms - is unhappy , too .
he is a former mountain rescue team member ; he 's run and walked through the lairig ghru ; and he knows how terrifying it can be to be caught in a white-out on the hills , when you literally ca n't see your hand a foot in front of your face .
he is calling on the magazine to print a follow-up article as quickly as possible , so its readers " know what they 're taking on " .
mountaineering legend sir chris bonnington agrees with that .
when i went to see him at his home near caldbeck in cumbria , he told me the magazine is normally excellent .
but this time , he said , " they 've made a mistake " .
if the experts who really know the area - like the mountain rescue team and the instructors at glenmore lodge - say you get snow on the lairig ghru , he said , trail magazine " would be very wise to listen to them and print a retraction " .

sales were up 0.8 % from september , and 0.3 % on last year , suggesting that japanese consumers are starting to share market confidence in an upturn .
personal consumption accounts for 55 % of the world 's second largest economy .
but a decade of stagnation has made japanese shoppers reluctant to plough savings back into the economy .
the increase in consumer spending follows a range of indicators suggesting japan may be beating its long run of underperformance .
return to growth the organisation for economic cooperation and development is now forecasting a 2.7 % expansion for the japanese economy in 2003 , and consistent growth - albeit at lower levels - for the next three years .
that would mark a significant change in the fortunes of asia 's largest economy , which grew 0.2 % last year , after years of recession and rising unemployment .
economic insecurity after the boom years of the 1980s led to a crisis of confidence among japanese consumers and a vicious circle of low domestic demand and falling prices .
but increased trade with the rest of asia , especially emerging giant china , have boosted other sectors of the economy .
earlier this month indicators showed industrial activity and trade up 2.2 % in september , beating analysts ' expectations .
japan 's trade with china is now slightly higher than trade with the us .
early days but analysts have warned it is too early to call an end to japan 's troubles .
a strong yen is still a drag on exports , while economic reforms promised by prime minister junichiro koizumi have proved difficult to realise .
meanwhile increased growth will need to be higher and more sustained to start easing unemployment .
the boost in retail sales may have been affected by one-off factors , such as demand for winter clothing .
but there will still be comfort for mr koizumi in increased demand at department stores and supermarkets , the first increase in 14 and 16 months respectively .
new car sales showed the biggest increase , up 5.9 % compared to the same time last year .
the nikkei index of japanese shares closed up 0.18 percent at 10,163 .

sales were up 0.8 % from september , and 0.3 % on last year , suggesting that japanese consumers are starting to share market confidence in an upturn .
personal consumption accounts for 55 % of the world 's second largest economy .
but a decade of stagnation has made japanese shoppers reluctant to plough savings back into the economy .
the increase in consumer spending follows a range of indicators suggesting japan may be beating its long run of underperformance .
return to growth the organisation for economic cooperation and development is now forecasting a 2.7 % expansion for the japanese economy in 2003 , and consistent growth - albeit at lower levels - for the next three years .
that would mark a significant change in the fortunes of asia 's largest economy , which grew 0.2 % last year , after years of recession and rising unemployment .
economic insecurity after the boom years of the 1980s led to a crisis of confidence among japanese consumers and a vicious circle of low domestic demand and falling prices .
but increased trade with the rest of asia , especially emerging giant china , have boosted other sectors of the economy .
earlier this month indicators showed industrial activity and trade up 2.2 % in september , beating analysts ' expectations .
japan 's trade with china is now slightly higher than trade with the us .
early days but analysts have warned it is too early to call an end to japan 's troubles .
a strong yen is still a drag on exports , while economic reforms promised by prime minister junichiro koizumi have proved difficult to realise .
meanwhile increased growth will need to be higher and more sustained to start easing unemployment .
the boost in retail sales may have been affected by one-off factors , such as demand for winter clothing .
but there will still be comfort for mr koizumi in increased demand at department stores and supermarkets , the first increase in 14 and 16 months respectively .
new car sales showed the biggest increase , up 5.9 % compared to the same time last year .
the nikkei index of japanese shares closed up 0.18 percent at 10,163 .

the prince rode with five other cattle-hands on the 40,000-acre tooloombilla station , southern queensland .
he said he had learnt a lot during his two months on the farm and described australia as " a great country . "
media were allowed to film and photograph the 19-year-old prince as he rode a horse called guardsman and posed on thursday .
harry , wearing an open neck blue shirt , jeans and brown akubra hat , looked relaxed as he guided the herd of 30 short horn and short horn charolais cattle around part of property .
he rode his chestnut-coloured horse alongside the steers as they were brought in from the outer reaches of the property , and at one stage galloped ahead to open the cattle pen .
i have had a great time working out here , meeting people and learning a bit about how to be a jackeroo and , of course , the rugby was absolutely fantastic prince harry in pictures : prince harry in australia he laughed and joked with the other station workers before dismounting and posing for photographers .
during his stay he has learnt how to handle cattle , repair damaged fencing and general farm maintenance - basic skills for a jackeroo .

working day the mid-morning temperature soared to around 30c , but this did not appear to bother the young prince .
his normal working day at the station begins at around 0730 and runs through to around 1800 with a two-hour lunch-break when the australian heat is at its most fierce .
the cattle station is owned by annie hill , a friend of harry 's late mother , diana , and noel hill , a son of millionaire polo star sinclair hill , who has coached prince charles .
earlier this week former royal butler paul burrell , who is australia publicising his book , said he would like to meet with harry while they are in the same country .
