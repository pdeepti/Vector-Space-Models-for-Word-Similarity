germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .

modern talking has split up .
again .
germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .

germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .

modern talking has split up .
again .
germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .
in an interview with the german woman 's magazine frau im spiegel , the acid-tongued singer said : " i finished the one thing in my life which was the least fun : modern talking " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dieter bohlen - germany 's prince of pop dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .

modern talking has split up .
again .
germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .
in an interview with the german woman 's magazine frau im spiegel , the acid-tongued singer said : " i finished the one thing in my life which was the least fun : modern talking " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dieter bohlen - germany 's prince of pop dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .

but this weekend , following a successful summit in greece , fischer had a first taste of a role he has so far so clearly denied . not only was fischer , alongside secretary of state colin powell , the only foreign minister to be formally greeted at this weekend 's opening of the world economic forum - despite the presence of various other eu ministers .
it was fischer who took on the role of speaking in the name of the eu at the opening platform discussion , and not eu foreign policy chief javiar solana , who sat with him on the stage . the message that fischer represents on his current middle east tour is clearly european : " the us is of course the decisive factor .
but the europeans will also make a substantial contribution " . inclusion of arab states joschka fischer 's travels in the coming days will take him to all four countries bordering the palestinian autonomous areas and israel - jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt - in an attempt to support the us ' efforts at promoting piece in the region . while the us is concentrating on the two main parties in the conflict , fischer hopes to animate governments in syria and lebanon , which support the anti-israeli organization hisbollah , to ensure the group does not torpedo the peace process . violence overshadows peace process both us secretary of state and the german foreign minister voiced concern that retaliation from militant organization hamas , following sunday 's killing of senior hamas official abdullah kawasme by israeli forces , could impede progress on the " road map " to peace . the road map , pieced together by diplomats from the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations , aims to bring to an end palestinian violence , a freeze on israeli settlement expansion and the creation of an independent palestinian state .
both conflict parties have already conceded to the plan . speaking on sunday , fischer called for arab leaders to recognize their own responsibilities with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" what strikes me is that israel is still always held responsible for everything negative ... or recently , the us as well .
i think that has lead nowhere in the past , and would do so now .
which is why i would like to suggest that the real challenge here is the modernization of the arab world . "
he said the inclusion of syria and lebanon was the next step in the middle east peace process . us the " driver " , europe the " tool box " fischer 's message , as he travels the middle east is clear : the eu has played an important role in the development of the so-called " road-map " , the current peace plan for the middle east and will continue to do so in the attempt for peace in the region . at the recent summit in greece , eu leaders agreed to step up pressure on the organization hamas .
on sunday , eu representatives will partake in further crucial talks on the future of the peace plan as the middle east quartet gets together on the fringe of the current world economic forum in jordan .
and fischer will continue europe 's concern and wish for a better future in the region on his current tour .
the us , fischer said , was sitting on the driver 's seat in the current peace process , but europe had " the tool box " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

modern talking has split up .
again .
germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .
in an interview with the german woman 's magazine frau im spiegel , the acid-tongued singer said : " i finished the one thing in my life which was the least fun : modern talking " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dieter bohlen - germany 's prince of pop dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .

modern talking has split up .
again .
germany mourns the break-up of their most infamous pop duo , modern talking , which staged its last concert on saturday .
it is not the first time that the band has split up . alas , they are no more .
germany 's most infamous pop duo , modern talking , bowed out at a final concert this weekend . the band , which has delighted germans and appalled critics for almost 20 years with their brand of teutonic pop played for the last time to a 11,000 strong crowd at berlin 's whulheide stadium saturday night . the band has cancelled all other concerts due this summer in cities across germany since their announced break-up at the beginning of june .
not the last goodbye ? it is not the first time the pair - record producer and singer dieter bohlen , -lrb- 49 -rrb- and musician thomas anders , -lrb- 40 -rrb- - have called it a day .
after forming in 1984 , anders and bohlen split just three years later citing artistic differences .
despite a string of number one hits including " cheri cheri lady " and " you 're my heart , you 're my soul " it was not until more than a decade later in 1998 that the pair re-entered the recording studio .
" believe me , there is no-one who is more happy that modern talking is together again , " bohlen said at the time .
but the modern talking phenomenon - which includes eleven albums , number one hits in 20 countries and bohlen 's memoirs , " nothing but the truth " -lrb- nichts als die wahrheit -rrb- which topped the book charts when they were published last year - was not to last for ever . now , after years of rumors of a possible break-up , the band has decided to write the last chapter in the modern talking saga .
the news came as a shock to modern talking fans as bohlen declared the break-up at a concert in the north german town of rostock in early june . thomas anders , for whom the sudden announcement also came as a surprise , confirmed the news but admitted that the timing – right at the start of their summer tour - may have not been right .
however , both musicians rejected allegations that a quarrel prior to the concert had led to bohlen 's spontaneous announcement . " thomas and i made the decision months ago that this would be the last year -lrb- of modern talking -rrb- " , bohlen said . more free time both anders and bohlen have said modern talking 's split will free them up to do other things .
anders will concentrate on his solo career , bohlen has started working on his second book and has just signed a three-year contract with private tv rtl for further involvement in the german version of reality tv show " pop idol " , in which bohlen starred as a judge last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , bohlen wants to spend more time with his family .
in an interview with the german woman 's magazine frau im spiegel , the acid-tongued singer said : " i finished the one thing in my life which was the least fun : modern talking " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dieter bohlen - germany 's prince of pop dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .

but this weekend , following a successful summit in greece , fischer had a first taste of a role he has so far so clearly denied . not only was fischer , alongside secretary of state colin powell , the only foreign minister to be formally greeted at this weekend 's opening of the world economic forum - despite the presence of various other eu ministers .
it was fischer who took on the role of speaking in the name of the eu at the opening platform discussion , and not eu foreign policy chief javiar solana , who sat with him on the stage . the message that fischer represents on his current middle east tour is clearly european : " the us is of course the decisive factor .
but the europeans will also make a substantial contribution " . inclusion of arab states joschka fischer 's travels in the coming days will take him to all four countries bordering the palestinian autonomous areas and israel - jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt - in an attempt to support the us ' efforts at promoting piece in the region . while the us is concentrating on the two main parties in the conflict , fischer hopes to animate governments in syria and lebanon , which support the anti-israeli organization hisbollah , to ensure the group does not torpedo the peace process . violence overshadows peace process both us secretary of state and the german foreign minister voiced concern that retaliation from militant organization hamas , following sunday 's killing of senior hamas official abdullah kawasme by israeli forces , could impede progress on the " road map " to peace . the road map , pieced together by diplomats from the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations , aims to bring to an end palestinian violence , a freeze on israeli settlement expansion and the creation of an independent palestinian state .
both conflict parties have already conceded to the plan . speaking on sunday , fischer called for arab leaders to recognize their own responsibilities with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" what strikes me is that israel is still always held responsible for everything negative ... or recently , the us as well .
i think that has lead nowhere in the past , and would do so now .
which is why i would like to suggest that the real challenge here is the modernization of the arab world . "
he said the inclusion of syria and lebanon was the next step in the middle east peace process . us the " driver " , europe the " tool box " fischer 's message , as he travels the middle east is clear : the eu has played an important role in the development of the so-called " road-map " , the current peace plan for the middle east and will continue to do so in the attempt for peace in the region . at the recent summit in greece , eu leaders agreed to step up pressure on the organization hamas .
on sunday , eu representatives will partake in further crucial talks on the future of the peace plan as the middle east quartet gets together on the fringe of the current world economic forum in jordan .
and fischer will continue europe 's concern and wish for a better future in the region on his current tour .
the us , fischer said , was sitting on the driver 's seat in the current peace process , but europe had " the tool box " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but this weekend , following a successful summit in greece , fischer had a first taste of a role he has so far so clearly denied . not only was fischer , alongside secretary of state colin powell , the only foreign minister to be formally greeted at this weekend 's opening of the world economic forum - despite the presence of various other eu ministers .
it was fischer who took on the role of speaking in the name of the eu at the opening platform discussion , and not eu foreign policy chief javiar solana , who sat with him on the stage . the message that fischer represents on his current middle east tour is clearly european : " the us is of course the decisive factor .
but the europeans will also make a substantial contribution " . inclusion of arab states joschka fischer 's travels in the coming days will take him to all four countries bordering the palestinian autonomous areas and israel - jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt - in an attempt to support the us ' efforts at promoting piece in the region . while the us is concentrating on the two main parties in the conflict , fischer hopes to animate governments in syria and lebanon , which support the anti-israeli organization hisbollah , to ensure the group does not torpedo the peace process . violence overshadows peace process both us secretary of state and the german foreign minister voiced concern that retaliation from militant organization hamas , following sunday 's killing of senior hamas official abdullah kawasme by israeli forces , could impede progress on the " road map " to peace . the road map , pieced together by diplomats from the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations , aims to bring to an end palestinian violence , a freeze on israeli settlement expansion and the creation of an independent palestinian state .
both conflict parties have already conceded to the plan . speaking on sunday , fischer called for arab leaders to recognize their own responsibilities with regard to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
" what strikes me is that israel is still always held responsible for everything negative ... or recently , the us as well .
i think that has lead nowhere in the past , and would do so now .
which is why i would like to suggest that the real challenge here is the modernization of the arab world . "
he said the inclusion of syria and lebanon was the next step in the middle east peace process . us the " driver " , europe the " tool box " fischer 's message , as he travels the middle east is clear : the eu has played an important role in the development of the so-called " road-map " , the current peace plan for the middle east and will continue to do so in the attempt for peace in the region . at the recent summit in greece , eu leaders agreed to step up pressure on the organization hamas .
on sunday , eu representatives will partake in further crucial talks on the future of the peace plan as the middle east quartet gets together on the fringe of the current world economic forum in jordan .
and fischer will continue europe 's concern and wish for a better future in the region on his current tour .
the us , fischer said , was sitting on the driver 's seat in the current peace process , but europe had " the tool box " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it 's not a question of wanting to be , it 's something i was born into and it 's my duty , " he said .

eighty police officers backed up by a surveillance helicopter picked him up at his farm during an dawn raid on his farm in southern france .
a sheep-farmer , bove has become a prominent critic of trade liberalisation and mass-produced food .
last year he served a jail term for attacking a mcdonalds restaurant in his home town of millau .
he is now due to serve two separate prison terms in connection with the destruction of genetically-modified crops of maize and rice in the late 1990s .
bove had sought to have the sentences overturned , but the appeal was turned down in february .
national hero his lawyer complained that police took him from his home in what amounted to a commando operation - involving a helicopter , police dogs and policemen who rammed his front door .
bove says gm crops are an environmental hazard the bbc 's caroline wyatt in paris says that to many in france and elsewhere , bove is not a criminal but a hero .
the french have nicknamed him asterix , both for his moustachioed resemblance to the cartoon character and his determination to repel what he sees as foreign invaders - be it in the form of mcdonalds or gm crops .
bove leads a militant group of farmers called the confederation paysanne , which champions smaller producers against big business .
their targets have included sites where experimental gm crops are grown - there are 100 such government-approved sites in france .
