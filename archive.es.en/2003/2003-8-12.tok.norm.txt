germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .

the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .

it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .
" the united states is in big trouble because nothing is going according to plan for secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , " it said .
if chancellor gerhard schröder is serious about reviving relations with washington , then he has to be willing to send german troops to iraq , the paper concluded .
the mittelbayerische zeitung argued , " germany can not brush aside the cries for help from the united states for much longer .
the german chancellor needs bush .
germany can ’ t represent its interests in the face of opposition from the only super power . "
the paper commented that malicious delight over the disarray in which american iraq policy finds itself , is misplaced .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .
" but one needs to see how creative the fund firms are .
if they are able to work around the new ruling and can maintain the tax advantages , media funds will continue to be attractive . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.08.2003 debate flares over german role in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have played an important role in afghanistan and the balkans .
germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .

the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .
" the united states is in big trouble because nothing is going according to plan for secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , " it said .
if chancellor gerhard schröder is serious about reviving relations with washington , then he has to be willing to send german troops to iraq , the paper concluded .
the mittelbayerische zeitung argued , " germany can not brush aside the cries for help from the united states for much longer .
the german chancellor needs bush .
germany can ’ t represent its interests in the face of opposition from the only super power . "
the paper commented that malicious delight over the disarray in which american iraq policy finds itself , is misplaced .
" germany relies on the u.s. economy much more than the reverse .
if the iraq mission ruins the u.s. national budget , the interest rates will increase . "
and that in turn , predicted the paper , could lead to a weakening of the world economy .
the wetzlarer neue zeitung observed that the united states is in financial difficulties and can not afford to carry the reconstruction costs on its own .
in addition , the paper pointed out , it is a tough job for bush to explain the point of the iraq mission to the home front while american soldiers are still dying .
" it ’ ll be easier for him to tell the electorate in 2004 : look , germany also has its problems on the euphrates and tigris , " the paper opined .
" let ’ s hope schröder remains strong and remembers what he promised before the war , the paper concluded : germany is not looking for adventure .
the saarbrücker zeitung turned its attention to the discussion of extending the afghanistan peacekeeping mandate beyond kabul .
it called for defense minister peter struck and chancellor schröder to come public with their plans for the country ’ s soldiers .
the paper cautioned that before deploying troops to high risk areas , a feasible concept is needed .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .
" the united states is in big trouble because nothing is going according to plan for secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , " it said .
if chancellor gerhard schröder is serious about reviving relations with washington , then he has to be willing to send german troops to iraq , the paper concluded .
the mittelbayerische zeitung argued , " germany can not brush aside the cries for help from the united states for much longer .
the german chancellor needs bush .
germany can ’ t represent its interests in the face of opposition from the only super power . "
the paper commented that malicious delight over the disarray in which american iraq policy finds itself , is misplaced .
" germany relies on the u.s. economy much more than the reverse .
if the iraq mission ruins the u.s. national budget , the interest rates will increase . "
and that in turn , predicted the paper , could lead to a weakening of the world economy .
the wetzlarer neue zeitung observed that the united states is in financial difficulties and can not afford to carry the reconstruction costs on its own .
in addition , the paper pointed out , it is a tough job for bush to explain the point of the iraq mission to the home front while american soldiers are still dying .
" it ’ ll be easier for him to tell the electorate in 2004 : look , germany also has its problems on the euphrates and tigris , " the paper opined .
" let ’ s hope schröder remains strong and remembers what he promised before the war , the paper concluded : germany is not looking for adventure .
the saarbrücker zeitung turned its attention to the discussion of extending the afghanistan peacekeeping mandate beyond kabul .
it called for defense minister peter struck and chancellor schröder to come public with their plans for the country ’ s soldiers .
the paper cautioned that before deploying troops to high risk areas , a feasible concept is needed .
the lives of german soldiers in the hindukush are at stake .
the fränkischer tag also commented on the situation in afghanistan saying that the misery in the country ’ s provinces can be brought to an end if the aid organizations and others can be permitted to get on with their work behind a protective shield and if aid which will help people to help themselves can be more or less fairly distributed .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .

the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .

it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .
a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.08.2003 hollywood grumbles over german fund plans new plans by the german government to cut tax benefits for investors in hollywood films could help the country ’ s stagnant economy but could also have unfavorable effects on the movie industry ’ s own crisis . there may not be many german actors dominating the silver screen in tinseltown these days but hollywood will definitely be feeling germany ’ s influence in other ways as the cash-strapped european powerhouse considers pulling the plug on millions of euros in investment . arnold schwarzenegger , currently starring in terminator 3 : rise of the machines , may not be back if germany goes through with plans to impose restrictions on the media funds that go a long way in bringing hollywood blockbusters to the screen .
it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .
" but one needs to see how creative the fund firms are .
if they are able to work around the new ruling and can maintain the tax advantages , media funds will continue to be attractive . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

if the iraq mission ruins the u.s. national budget , the interest rates will increase . "
and that in turn , predicted the paper , could lead to a weakening of the world economy .
the wetzlarer neue zeitung observed that the united states is in financial difficulties and can not afford to carry the reconstruction costs on its own .
in addition , the paper pointed out , it is a tough job for bush to explain the point of the iraq mission to the home front while american soldiers are still dying .
" it ’ ll be easier for him to tell the electorate in 2004 : look , germany also has its problems on the euphrates and tigris , " the paper opined .
" let ’ s hope schröder remains strong and remembers what he promised before the war , the paper concluded : germany is not looking for adventure .
the saarbrücker zeitung turned its attention to the discussion of extending the afghanistan peacekeeping mandate beyond kabul .
it called for defense minister peter struck and chancellor schröder to come public with their plans for the country ’ s soldiers .
the paper cautioned that before deploying troops to high risk areas , a feasible concept is needed .
the lives of german soldiers in the hindukush are at stake .
the fränkischer tag also commented on the situation in afghanistan saying that the misery in the country ’ s provinces can be brought to an end if the aid organizations and others can be permitted to get on with their work behind a protective shield and if aid which will help people to help themselves can be more or less fairly distributed .
millions of people in afghanistan fight for survival every day , the paper noted .
if the presence of the german armed forces can ease this suffering , then the extended mission should be allowed to go ahead , it concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .
" the united states is in big trouble because nothing is going according to plan for secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , " it said .
if chancellor gerhard schröder is serious about reviving relations with washington , then he has to be willing to send german troops to iraq , the paper concluded .
the mittelbayerische zeitung argued , " germany can not brush aside the cries for help from the united states for much longer .
the german chancellor needs bush .
germany can ’ t represent its interests in the face of opposition from the only super power . "
the paper commented that malicious delight over the disarray in which american iraq policy finds itself , is misplaced .
" germany relies on the u.s. economy much more than the reverse .
if the iraq mission ruins the u.s. national budget , the interest rates will increase . "
and that in turn , predicted the paper , could lead to a weakening of the world economy .
the wetzlarer neue zeitung observed that the united states is in financial difficulties and can not afford to carry the reconstruction costs on its own .
in addition , the paper pointed out , it is a tough job for bush to explain the point of the iraq mission to the home front while american soldiers are still dying .
" it ’ ll be easier for him to tell the electorate in 2004 : look , germany also has its problems on the euphrates and tigris , " the paper opined .
" let ’ s hope schröder remains strong and remembers what he promised before the war , the paper concluded : germany is not looking for adventure .
the saarbrücker zeitung turned its attention to the discussion of extending the afghanistan peacekeeping mandate beyond kabul .
it called for defense minister peter struck and chancellor schröder to come public with their plans for the country ’ s soldiers .
the paper cautioned that before deploying troops to high risk areas , a feasible concept is needed .
the lives of german soldiers in the hindukush are at stake .
the fränkischer tag also commented on the situation in afghanistan saying that the misery in the country ’ s provinces can be brought to an end if the aid organizations and others can be permitted to get on with their work behind a protective shield and if aid which will help people to help themselves can be more or less fairly distributed .
millions of people in afghanistan fight for survival every day , the paper noted .
if the presence of the german armed forces can ease this suffering , then the extended mission should be allowed to go ahead , it concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.08.2003 debate flares over german role in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have played an important role in afghanistan and the balkans .
germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.08.2003 hollywood grumbles over german fund plans new plans by the german government to cut tax benefits for investors in hollywood films could help the country ’ s stagnant economy but could also have unfavorable effects on the movie industry ’ s own crisis . there may not be many german actors dominating the silver screen in tinseltown these days but hollywood will definitely be feeling germany ’ s influence in other ways as the cash-strapped european powerhouse considers pulling the plug on millions of euros in investment . arnold schwarzenegger , currently starring in terminator 3 : rise of the machines , may not be back if germany goes through with plans to impose restrictions on the media funds that go a long way in bringing hollywood blockbusters to the screen .
it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .
" but one needs to see how creative the fund firms are .
if they are able to work around the new ruling and can maintain the tax advantages , media funds will continue to be attractive . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .
a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .

germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan . america ’ s public praise of the german mission in afghanistan has shown that george w. bush is willing to forgive the germans , commented the berliner zeitung and added that the praise came because bush needs germany ’ s support .
" the united states is in big trouble because nothing is going according to plan for secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , " it said .
if chancellor gerhard schröder is serious about reviving relations with washington , then he has to be willing to send german troops to iraq , the paper concluded .
the mittelbayerische zeitung argued , " germany can not brush aside the cries for help from the united states for much longer .
the german chancellor needs bush .
germany can ’ t represent its interests in the face of opposition from the only super power . "
the paper commented that malicious delight over the disarray in which american iraq policy finds itself , is misplaced .
" germany relies on the u.s. economy much more than the reverse .
if the iraq mission ruins the u.s. national budget , the interest rates will increase . "
and that in turn , predicted the paper , could lead to a weakening of the world economy .
the wetzlarer neue zeitung observed that the united states is in financial difficulties and can not afford to carry the reconstruction costs on its own .
in addition , the paper pointed out , it is a tough job for bush to explain the point of the iraq mission to the home front while american soldiers are still dying .
" it ’ ll be easier for him to tell the electorate in 2004 : look , germany also has its problems on the euphrates and tigris , " the paper opined .
" let ’ s hope schröder remains strong and remembers what he promised before the war , the paper concluded : germany is not looking for adventure .
the saarbrücker zeitung turned its attention to the discussion of extending the afghanistan peacekeeping mandate beyond kabul .
it called for defense minister peter struck and chancellor schröder to come public with their plans for the country ’ s soldiers .
the paper cautioned that before deploying troops to high risk areas , a feasible concept is needed .
the lives of german soldiers in the hindukush are at stake .
the fränkischer tag also commented on the situation in afghanistan saying that the misery in the country ’ s provinces can be brought to an end if the aid organizations and others can be permitted to get on with their work behind a protective shield and if aid which will help people to help themselves can be more or less fairly distributed .
millions of people in afghanistan fight for survival every day , the paper noted .
if the presence of the german armed forces can ease this suffering , then the extended mission should be allowed to go ahead , it concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2003 germans , czechs prevent next big flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washing away borders between germany and the czech republic .
a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .
" a year after the floods , it ’ s hardly discernible , that those responsible on a state level are prepared to draw the right lessons from the floods , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de floods of the century revisited parts of germany were devastated by floods in august 2003 .
a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .
the plans envisions raising the storage capacities of existing dams on the moldau and other rivers .
last august , the dams reduced the level of destruction caused by the floods in prague , by delaying the arrival of the deluge .
that allowed authorities more time for evacuations and other preventive measures .
the dams also prevented uprooted trees and weekend houses from being swept into the czech capital with the current .
in order to better protect flood-prone villages and cities , the czech government also plans in future to install more mobile insulated walls in additional parts of the country , such as the ones that preserved downtown prague from floods last year .
prague has already applied for funds from the european union to finance the flood-prevention measures .
green groups : action plan not enough environmental groups have in principle welcomed germany ’ s efforts to prevent a repetition of last year ’ s disastrous floods , but accuse the government of having learned nothing from the catastrophe .
many are also skeptical of the ikse ’ s action plan and its focus on relocating embankment areas .
scientist manfred simon cast doubts on the reliability of the embankments , that last year managed to hold back the floods .
" the embankments are a couple of hundred years old and don ’ t have the necessary stability , " he told news agency afp .
" higher embankments only store the problem , instead of solving it , " emil dister of green group world wide fund germany said .

a year after devastating floods ravaged eastern germany and the czech republic , experts from both sides have hammered out a flood-prevention plan .
environmentalists however remain skeptical . a year after the worst floods in a century wrecked a dozen years of post-unification rebuilding in eastern germany and ravaged the neighboring czech republic , hardly anything in the rivers in the region indicate the extent of the recent catastrophe .
where once a deluge strained against the embankments , today only a few small streams are visible after a week of near-total dry river beds and record low water levels .
though the danger of new catastrophic floods can hardly be ruled out , the unexpected heat wave and accompanying drought this summer have provided a further respite for flood-prevention experts , working on an action plan to secure the river elbe from flooding .
the international commission for protecting the elbe -lrb- ikse -rrb- comprising german and czech flood specialists , were originally meant to present their findings on the state and health of the river elbe last summer .
but the onslaught of the floods , the worst in more than 200 years , meant that the team had to start their work all over again from scratch .
now the group finally aims to present its action plan by autumn this year , though certain proposals have already been leaked out .
reducing embankments and expanding flood plains the experts have suggested 15 areas , where the present embankments for the elbe and its tributaries can be pulled down and instead built further back in the interiors to allow for about 27 further square kilometers of flood plains .
in addition to reducing embankments , which environmentalists believe contribute to uncontrolled run-off from alpine-spawned deluges , the commission has also proposed refurbishing about 550 kilometers of embankment , which don ’ t correspond to current safety standards .
further , 16 new flood plains will be designated in an effort to give back rivers their natural storage basins .
the largest of these flood plains are planned in saxony-anhalt .
not all of the plans have met with enthusiasm .
some of the proposals which have already been implemented , such as the spectacular tearing-down of the settlement röderau-süd , have been criticized .
in april this year , work began on demolishing a total of 120 apartment blocks in a small district of the town of riesa in saxony , which had been erected on flood plain areas .
even in dresden , which bore the brunt of the floods last year , numerous small gardens and vegetable patches , which prevented the flow of flood waters into tributaries and streams , have been destroyed .
german environment minister jürgen trittin also wants to impose a blanket ban on future residential and industrial development in designated flood plain regions as well as forbid plowing and sowing of the land starting 2013 .
in future farmers will not be allowed to fertilize flood plain regions measuring up to 24 square meters , and other agricultural activity will also be limited .
the minister has also stressed that in case of floods , the affected farmers will have no right to compensation .
czechs stress expanding flood-zones as opposed to germany , the ikse ’ s recommendations for the neighboring czech republic lay heavy emphasis on expanding flood-zones given that very few places in the country are hemmed in by dikes .

it ’ s a little known fact that about 20 percent of hollywood 's entire production budget comes from german media funds , according to the estimates of financial experts .
films such as kramer vs. kramer , mission : impossible 2 and enemy at the gates have all had a helping hand from german investors .
the chances of the viewing public seeing the fourth terminator in the future would be severely dented if such a large source of funding dries up . hollywood is suffering its own cash crisis but it ’ s nothing compared to germany ’ s financial woes .
however , things could get a lot worse for the film industry in los angeles if what the big wigs in la la land call " stupid german money " stops flowing in from the other side of the atlantic .
the considerable investment germany has provided over many years has long been a thorn in the side of berlin ’ s finance ministry , yet , under current rules , those who choose to invest in hollywood productions can write off 100 percent or more in initial losses against tax , making investment in the movies an attractive option for thousands of private investors looking for a home for their money .
germans invest about € 2 billion in media funds per year , with about 70 percent of that going to projects in the united states .
new rules for film investment but all that will change if a new ruling by the german government comes into force . chancellor schröder 's administration , burdened with an economy which is buckling under a three-year stagnation , aims to remove existing tax breaks for investors buying into such movie-based funds as deutsche capital management 's imf 3 , and chorus apollomedia funds except in cases where these investors take an active role in choosing the screenplay and the cast of a film .
this is unlikely to sit well with the movie moguls who are counting every cent and dollar in the shadow of the hollywood hills .
germany ’ s new plans would make the pre-production process more expensive , not to mention more time-consuming and complex .
plus , the idea of having german investors picking the cast of a massively expensive production , a cast which will determine if people go to see the film and therefore make it a success , will have some producer ’ s in a cold sweat .
however , andreas konle , the chief financial officer at internationalmedia , which helped produce terminator 3 with money from german media funds , believes that although placing the power of casting in the hands of investors may be a recipe for disaster , the plans would not mean the end of media fund financing .
" i doubt that it makes sense to have dentists and lawyers decide on whether to have richard gere star in a film or a german actor , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we think the changes will be manageable and media funds will continue to exist . "
slump in hollywood films other people in the business have a less rosy view of the proposed plans , due to come into effect next year .
many in the financial sector have unsurprisingly criticised the german government .
karsten mieth , of media fund provider chorus , told reuters : " big u.s. firms just wo n't accept having their cast determined in such a way . "
michael oehme , head of the federation of german media funds , added , " we will see a massive slump in investments in big u.s. film projects . "
oehme said the funds may shift from bigger to smaller film projects or invest more in tv productions .
financial experts are sitting firmly in the back row , watching the story develop in front of them before making any firm decisions .
" if the u.s. firms are no longer willing to take on this german investment , media fund products in germany will decrease , " one financial adviser in berlin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.08.2003 debate flares over german role in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have played an important role in afghanistan and the balkans .
germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices . germany ’ s staunch opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq caused the worst break between long-time allies washington and berlin in decades .
after months of giving the cold shoulder , u.s. president george bush ’ s icy relations with german chancellor gerhard schröder have only this week begun to thaw noticeably . praise from bush on germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan caused some flattered officials in berlin to ponder how to clear any remaining tension out of the way .
now only a few months after the controversial war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein was won , leading german politicians have begun to debate under just what circumstances germany could help the united states win the peace in iraq . german defense minister peter struck this week said if there was a united nations resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country . nato takes lead in afghanistan , possible role in iraq washington , in the hopes of offsetting some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , is reportedly working on a new u.n. resolution for iraq .
nato , which on monday took over command of peacekeeping forces in afghanistan from german and the netherlands , could then help with some of the heavy lifting in iraq . " if the relevant u.n. mandates are in place and if nato is asked to take on more responsibility , then we would have no reason to oppose an engagement by the alliance in iraq , " struck told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . those comments unleashed a torrent of debate in berlin both in and outside of the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens .
the government spokesman thomas steg on monday said struck was speaking “ very hypothetically ” and that “ nothing had changed ” regarding germany ’ s position on iraq . despite the party ’ s strong pacifistic roots , greens leader and military expert angelika beer said germany could not completely rule out a german role in iraq .
she said she hoped the united states and britain would transfer administration of the country to the united nations , which if it then asked nato for help , germany would have to consider . but other politicians rejected sending the german army to iraq on any basis . german army swamped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ participation is out of the question , ” greens environment minister jürgen trittin told n-tv television , adding that the german military with missions in afghanistan , the balkans and elsewhere was “ completely swamped . ” the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats gernot erler dismissed any talk about sending german troops to the still troubled country as “ speculation . ” conservatives cautious christian schmidt , the defense spokesman for the conservative opposition , said the government was merely trying to patch things up with the bush administration by putting the issue on the table . but other conservatives were less quick to condemn possible nato and german participation in postwar iraq .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for the christian democrats , said a concrete concept for a u.n. mandate was necessary before a role for nato could be seriously discussed . but he also held out the possibility sending german troops on the basis that it would be wrong to rule out helping stabilize iraq , especially if there was an appropriate u.n. mandate . “ to say again : we won ’ t take part no matter what is wrong , ” schäuble told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : bundeswehr in iraq and afghanistan germany 's editorials on tuesday focused on possible future deployments for the country 's armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .

figures issued by the government showed that in the three months to june the economy grew 0.6 % , well ahead of the 0.2 % forecast by economists .
stock prices responded strongly to the news , as investors piled into property companies and the big banks .
the two sectors are among those worst hit by japan 's decade-long downturn , the one hit by slumping prices and the other burdened by trillions of yen in bad debts .
" it 's definitely positive news , and suggests that the expansion is continuing , " said peter morgan , chief economist at hsbc securities .
" if anything , things might pick up a bit more in the second half of this year . "
spending turnaround the good news - which translates into 2.3 % growth for a full year , the best showing since the july-september quarter last year - should come as a relief to prime minister junichiro koizumi .
his term as head of his liberal democratic party is up next month , and good economic news will help him in the election that will decide whether he stays in charge .
the contribution of personal consumption is particularly welcome , since the reluctance of japanese shoppers to spend has been a key factor in the country 's economic travails .
spending rose 0.3 % , helped in part by the fact that hundreds of thousands of overseas trips were cancelled due to the sars virus which led to money being spent at home instead .
housing spending was less impressive , falling 0.4 % .
but that was more than countered by the renewed willingness of businesses to invest , after years of stagnant business confidence .
other recent triggers for cautious optimism have included a dip in the number of people out of work , which was registered two weeks ago for the first time in three months .
and a recent reading of 2.4 % in annualised growth in the us was also positive for japan , in the shape of renewed hopes that exports might be in for a boost .

the environment agency will be taking to the river on tuesday to scoop out the fish , which have died because of low oxygen levels caused by the current warm weather .
it is feared there could be a record number of dead fish in the river .

most of the fish have been found in the tidal area between wylam and newburn .

roger inverarity , water quality technical specialist , said : " we arranged for a similar release from kielder for two days starting on july 25 .
" this coincided with a small amount of rainfall and apparently encouraged some fish to move upstream .
" over a three day period , the number of fish counted through the agency 's fish counter at riding mill near corbridge was about 400 higher than the preceding three days .
" but the total number counted throughout july was 6,000 , so while the release appears to have resulted in extra fish movement it was not a spectacular result .
" with the current hot weather ... we arranged a further two day release of water from kielder last thursday . "
the water released over these two days would be enough to supply all of tyneside with drinking water for a fortnight .

the environment agency will be taking to the river on tuesday to scoop out the fish , which have died because of low oxygen levels caused by the current warm weather .
it is feared there could be a record number of dead fish in the river .
the agency has already removed 600 dead salmon and 33 sea trout from the river and is expecting to pick up another 50 a day while the warm weather continues .
most of the fish have been found in the tidal area between wylam and newburn .
drinking water to try to combat the problem , the agency has twice released better-oxygenated water from kielder reservoir into the river in an effort to help salmon move out of the estuary and into the freshwater section of the river .
roger inverarity , water quality technical specialist , said : " we arranged for a similar release from kielder for two days starting on july 25 .
" this coincided with a small amount of rainfall and apparently encouraged some fish to move upstream .
" over a three day period , the number of fish counted through the agency 's fish counter at riding mill near corbridge was about 400 higher than the preceding three days .
" but the total number counted throughout july was 6,000 , so while the release appears to have resulted in extra fish movement it was not a spectacular result .

residents and businessmen and women say the casual traders , who charge for hair braiding and henna tattoos are " littering " the streets , give the port a bad name and take valuable income from traders who have to pay business rates .
north cornwall district council is considering imposing a ban in the harbour area .
mike fox , a former chairman and president of the padstow chamber of commerce , said : " it 's been a source of aggravation to local traders and causes quite a large obstruction during the height of the season .
" they bum their way around life and it 's lowering the tone of padstow which to a large degree has gone upmarket and i think it 's not a good thing for the town . "
the imposition of the ban on street trading in the harbour is due to be discussed on 18 august by north cornwall district council .
a separate by-law would have to be drawn up to cover hair braiders and henna tattooists .
the authority 's legal department is currently looking into how to implement the legislation .

the national australia bank 's monthly survey of how optimistic businesses are about the future hit a 15-month high in july , as australia 's non-farm economy outpaced the sluggishness seen elsewhere in the world .
the reading will probably undermine the case made by the australian industry group -lrb- aig -rrb- last month for a cut in interest rates from 4.75 % .
that makes borrowing much more expensive in australia than in the us , europe , the uk or japan .
the aig said on 1 july that its index of manufacturing performance showed output was flat in june .
bullish but the economy seems to be surviving nonetheless , and the reserve bank of australia has made it clear that as things are , it will stick to its guns .
one of the key reasons is the property market , as australia 's house price boom outstrips even the uk .
prices in sydney rose 27 % in the year to june , taking the price tag of an average dwelling to a $ 569,000 - more than 12 times average earnings .
ten years ago , the price was just a $ 176,000 .
the upsurge in mortgages , the rba said in a statement , was " well in excess of what could be considered sustainable " in the medium to long term .
" the risk presented by these developments is that , the longer they go on , the larger , will be the contractionary effect on the economy when they inevitably turn . "
risks to the economy include the after-effects of the drought which has ravaged australian farming , and the strength of the australian dollar which risks damaging exports .

one of the key reasons is the property market , as australia 's house price boom outstrips even the uk .
prices in sydney rose 27 % in the year to june , taking the price tag of an average dwelling to a $ 569,000 - more than 12 times average earnings .
ten years ago , the price was just a $ 176,000 .
the upsurge in mortgages , the rba said in a statement , was " well in excess of what could be considered sustainable " in the medium to long term .
" the risk presented by these developments is that , the longer they go on , the larger , will be the contractionary effect on the economy when they inevitably turn . "
risks to the economy include the after-effects of the drought which has ravaged australian farming , and the strength of the australian dollar which risks damaging exports .

twenty miners were killed in the explosion on monday in the state-owned xingergou mine near the city of datong and 13 others died later in hospitals , the official xinhua news agency said .
some 286 mine workers were rescued after the explosion , zhao tiechui , deputy director of the state administration for work safety , was quoted as saying monday by state television .
the cause of the explosion is under investigation .
chinese coal mines have the worst safety record in the world .
official figures indicate more than 5,000 people were killed last year alone , while other estimates suggest the figure could be much higher .
such explosions are usually caused by the accidental ignition of gas that seeps from the coal and builds up due to poor ventilation .
many such incidents occur in privately owned mines , which lack operating licences and adequate safety equipment .
china relies heavily on the coal industry for its energy needs .

the satellite broadcaster said pre-tax profits before charges for the 12 months to late june came in at £ 260m -lrb- $ 416m -rrb- , up from a loss of £ 22m one year earlier .
it was the first time the firm , 36 % owned by rupert murdoch 's news corporation , had reported an annual pre-tax profit in five years .
total sales were also up , climbing 15 % on the year to £ 3.18bn. "
with only half of households signed up to digital television , there is still plenty of growth potential in the uk " bskyb ceo tony ball bskyb said its improved performance reflected continued strong growth in subscriber numbers , with a further 133,000 viewers signing up between april and june this year .
the increase brought the total subscriber base to 6.8m , just shy of the 7m target bskyb has pledged to reach by the end of 2003 .
in a sign that bskyb 's subscription-only sport and movie channels remain popular with viewers , the churn - the rate at which subscribers drop out - fell to 9.4 % from 10.4 % one year earlier , well below the drop-out rate at rival pay tv firms .
eu competition concerns bskyb added that it had bucked gloomy trends in the advertising market , with total advertising sales climbing 13 % compared with last year to £ 284m .
bskyb chief executive tony ball pledged further expansion in the months ahead .
" with only half of households signed up to digital television , there is still plenty of growth potential in the uk , " he said .
bskyb is expected to consolidate its position as britain 's top pay tv channel thanks to a new £ 1bn deal giving it exclusive rights to broadcast live english premiership football matches for three years from the start of the 2004/05 season .
bskyb 's existing three year premiership broadcast deal , which expires at the end of the current football season , is a key element of the channel 's appeal to viewers .
the company said its screening of match between top-ranked premiership clubs manchester united and arsenal in april this year attracted a near-record audience of 3.8m viewers .
however , bskyb 's new premiership deal could yet fall foul of european union regulators , who have asked for assurances that the bidding process for the broadcast rights was competitive .
bskyb shares were down 16p , or 2.2 % , at 708p in late afternoon trade in london .
