the actress gave one of ena 's trademark hairnets to a woman from st austell , cornwall , in thanks for a birthday card in 1976 .
twenty seven years on , it went under the hammer at a sale in laddock , near truro .
auctioneer philip buddell said : " there was good bidding for it but it was more to do with its fascination than desirability .
" we only got £ 50 which is probably what it is worth . "
the local buyer wished to remain anonymous .
a second hairnet given by violet carson to a female corrie fan from delabole in north cornwall 30 years ago failed to attract any offers from 150 potential buyers .

ena , played by the late violet carson , appeared in the first episode of the manchester-based tv soap in 1960 , and remained on the street for 20 years .
the actress gave one of ena 's trademark hairnets to a woman from st austell , cornwall , in thanks for a birthday card in 1976 .
twenty seven years on , it went under the hammer at a sale in laddock , near truro .
auctioneer philip buddell said : " there was good bidding for it but it was more to do with its fascination than desirability .
" we only got £ 50 which is probably what it is worth . "
the local buyer wished to remain anonymous .
a second hairnet given by violet carson to a female corrie fan from delabole in north cornwall 30 years ago failed to attract any offers from 150 potential buyers .
mr buddell said corrie fans who missed out on the sale would have a chance to buy the second hairnet at a future auction .
