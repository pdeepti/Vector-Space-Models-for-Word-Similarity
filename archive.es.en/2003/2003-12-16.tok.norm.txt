program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2003 germany 's arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 550 million small arms are in circulation worldwide .
the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace .
-lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .

but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .
but he was also quick to point out that " the credibility of germany 's commitment to tackling the problem on an international level is inextricably linked to its domestic arms policy .

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .
“ luther wanted to move the gift-giving away from the catholic holiday on dec .
6 , ” said nuremberg tourism manager michael weber .
“ so he reinvented the tradition for protestants by moving it to christmas eve and making the christkind – really , the baby jesus – the person who brought the gifts . ” it was under the rule of the national socialists that the image of today ’ s christkind was ultimately anchored in the collective german mind . they built on nuremberg ’ s tradition of producing tinsel angels , and in 1933 , had a young girl in an angel costume open the city ’ s christmas market for the first time . after the second world war , nuremberg ’ s tinsel angels became simply the nuremberg christkind , and the figures were sold nation-wide . for strauber , her time as the nuremberg christkind is a chance to “ spread christian beliefs . ”
she says she tells curious children that the christkind knows about the behavior of every boy and girl , but doesn ’ t punish . that job goes to another german christmas figure , knecht ruprecht , saint nicholaus ’ grumpy sidekick . strauber has already developed tactics to deal with the more sceptical kids that cross her path . when challenged to fly , she tells them that the christkind only flies at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when she 's not playing the christkind , christin strauber is a normal german teenager .
beneath her angelic exterior , though , strauber is still a normal 17-year old , slightly giddy at the sudden fame her new job has brought .
“ i wasn ’ t at all prepared for the media attention , ” she said .
“ it was like being thrown in the deep end . when the vote was announced there were at least six newspaper reporters there and five camera teams .
i ’ m used to it now , but it made me really nervous at first . ” strauber also admits to surfing around a lot more on the internet since she won the vote , just to see where her name pops up . even the christkind , it seems , is allowed a little vanity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas each year , tourists from around the globe flock to germany 's traditional christmas markets .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .

-lrb- june 25 , 2003 -rrb- fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .

“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2003 after constitution split , eu widens dispute to budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control funding would suffer under the proposed budget axing .
six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .
“ we will study these ideas seriously , but with only 1 percent of gni -lrb- gross national income -rrb- , it will not be possible to do what these member states – and all others – expect from us . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu question : integrate or separate ?

the project was first launched in 1994 by the building society " stadt magdeburg von 1954 " and entrusted four years later to austrian artist and architect friedensreich hundertwasser , who died in 2000 .
the striking pink-colored building will contain some 11,000 square meters of 55 apartments , 18 offices , 18 stores , exhibition and gallery space , a 42-room-hotel , a kindergarten and a roof garden - and will cost an estimated € 27 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million . -rrb-
the ambitious project was repeatedly put on hold due to lack of funds and cost negotiations .
residents also objected to hundertwasser 's distinctive , playful architecture occupying center stage on what was once one of europe 's best-preserved baroque quarters before destruction during world war ii .
hunderwasser 's very last design is expected to be realized by late 2005 . dw-world.de what 's on at europe 's museums hundertwasser 's architecture is the focus of an exhibition in magdeburg that runs through jan .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .

six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .

like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .

shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2003 after constitution split , eu widens dispute to budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control funding would suffer under the proposed budget axing .
six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .
“ we will study these ideas seriously , but with only 1 percent of gni -lrb- gross national income -rrb- , it will not be possible to do what these member states – and all others – expect from us . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu question : integrate or separate ?
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ”

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .

six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .

the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .

chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .

fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .

ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "

during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .
but he was also quick to point out that " the credibility of germany 's commitment to tackling the problem on an international level is inextricably linked to its domestic arms policy . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turns blind eye to berlin-beijing nuclear deal schröder ’ s support for easing the eu arms embargo on china and plans to export a plutonium plant may have sparked an outcry in germany , but other eu heavyweights have long been pursuing similar policies with beijing .

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .
“ luther wanted to move the gift-giving away from the catholic holiday on dec .
6 , ” said nuremberg tourism manager michael weber .
“ so he reinvented the tradition for protestants by moving it to christmas eve and making the christkind – really , the baby jesus – the person who brought the gifts . ” it was under the rule of the national socialists that the image of today ’ s christkind was ultimately anchored in the collective german mind . they built on nuremberg ’ s tradition of producing tinsel angels , and in 1933 , had a young girl in an angel costume open the city ’ s christmas market for the first time . after the second world war , nuremberg ’ s tinsel angels became simply the nuremberg christkind , and the figures were sold nation-wide . for strauber , her time as the nuremberg christkind is a chance to “ spread christian beliefs . ”
she says she tells curious children that the christkind knows about the behavior of every boy and girl , but doesn ’ t punish . that job goes to another german christmas figure , knecht ruprecht , saint nicholaus ’ grumpy sidekick . strauber has already developed tactics to deal with the more sceptical kids that cross her path . when challenged to fly , she tells them that the christkind only flies at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when she 's not playing the christkind , christin strauber is a normal german teenager .
beneath her angelic exterior , though , strauber is still a normal 17-year old , slightly giddy at the sudden fame her new job has brought .
“ i wasn ’ t at all prepared for the media attention , ” she said .
“ it was like being thrown in the deep end . when the vote was announced there were at least six newspaper reporters there and five camera teams .
i ’ m used to it now , but it made me really nervous at first . ” strauber also admits to surfing around a lot more on the internet since she won the vote , just to see where her name pops up . even the christkind , it seems , is allowed a little vanity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas each year , tourists from around the globe flock to germany 's traditional christmas markets .

the project was first launched in 1994 by the building society " stadt magdeburg von 1954 " and entrusted four years later to austrian artist and architect friedensreich hundertwasser , who died in 2000 .
the striking pink-colored building will contain some 11,000 square meters of 55 apartments , 18 offices , 18 stores , exhibition and gallery space , a 42-room-hotel , a kindergarten and a roof garden - and will cost an estimated € 27 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million . -rrb-
the ambitious project was repeatedly put on hold due to lack of funds and cost negotiations .
residents also objected to hundertwasser 's distinctive , playful architecture occupying center stage on what was once one of europe 's best-preserved baroque quarters before destruction during world war ii .
hunderwasser 's very last design is expected to be realized by late 2005 . dw-world.de what 's on at europe 's museums hundertwasser 's architecture is the focus of an exhibition in magdeburg that runs through jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2003 after constitution split , eu widens dispute to budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control funding would suffer under the proposed budget axing .
six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .
“ we will study these ideas seriously , but with only 1 percent of gni -lrb- gross national income -rrb- , it will not be possible to do what these member states – and all others – expect from us . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu question : integrate or separate ?
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ”

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .
“ luther wanted to move the gift-giving away from the catholic holiday on dec .
6 , ” said nuremberg tourism manager michael weber .
“ so he reinvented the tradition for protestants by moving it to christmas eve and making the christkind – really , the baby jesus – the person who brought the gifts . ” it was under the rule of the national socialists that the image of today ’ s christkind was ultimately anchored in the collective german mind . they built on nuremberg ’ s tradition of producing tinsel angels , and in 1933 , had a young girl in an angel costume open the city ’ s christmas market for the first time . after the second world war , nuremberg ’ s tinsel angels became simply the nuremberg christkind , and the figures were sold nation-wide . for strauber , her time as the nuremberg christkind is a chance to “ spread christian beliefs . ”
she says she tells curious children that the christkind knows about the behavior of every boy and girl , but doesn ’ t punish . that job goes to another german christmas figure , knecht ruprecht , saint nicholaus ’ grumpy sidekick . strauber has already developed tactics to deal with the more sceptical kids that cross her path . when challenged to fly , she tells them that the christkind only flies at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when she 's not playing the christkind , christin strauber is a normal german teenager .

six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .
“ luther wanted to move the gift-giving away from the catholic holiday on dec .
6 , ” said nuremberg tourism manager michael weber .
“ so he reinvented the tradition for protestants by moving it to christmas eve and making the christkind – really , the baby jesus – the person who brought the gifts . ” it was under the rule of the national socialists that the image of today ’ s christkind was ultimately anchored in the collective german mind . they built on nuremberg ’ s tradition of producing tinsel angels , and in 1933 , had a young girl in an angel costume open the city ’ s christmas market for the first time . after the second world war , nuremberg ’ s tinsel angels became simply the nuremberg christkind , and the figures were sold nation-wide . for strauber , her time as the nuremberg christkind is a chance to “ spread christian beliefs . ”
she says she tells curious children that the christkind knows about the behavior of every boy and girl , but doesn ’ t punish . that job goes to another german christmas figure , knecht ruprecht , saint nicholaus ’ grumpy sidekick . strauber has already developed tactics to deal with the more sceptical kids that cross her path . when challenged to fly , she tells them that the christkind only flies at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when she 's not playing the christkind , christin strauber is a normal german teenager .
beneath her angelic exterior , though , strauber is still a normal 17-year old , slightly giddy at the sudden fame her new job has brought .
“ i wasn ’ t at all prepared for the media attention , ” she said .
“ it was like being thrown in the deep end . when the vote was announced there were at least six newspaper reporters there and five camera teams .
i ’ m used to it now , but it made me really nervous at first . ” strauber also admits to surfing around a lot more on the internet since she won the vote , just to see where her name pops up . even the christkind , it seems , is allowed a little vanity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas each year , tourists from around the globe flock to germany 's traditional christmas markets .

the project was first launched in 1994 by the building society " stadt magdeburg von 1954 " and entrusted four years later to austrian artist and architect friedensreich hundertwasser , who died in 2000 .
the striking pink-colored building will contain some 11,000 square meters of 55 apartments , 18 offices , 18 stores , exhibition and gallery space , a 42-room-hotel , a kindergarten and a roof garden - and will cost an estimated € 27 million -lrb- $ 33.3 million . -rrb-
the ambitious project was repeatedly put on hold due to lack of funds and cost negotiations .
residents also objected to hundertwasser 's distinctive , playful architecture occupying center stage on what was once one of europe 's best-preserved baroque quarters before destruction during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2003 after constitution split , eu widens dispute to budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border control funding would suffer under the proposed budget axing .
six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .
“ we will study these ideas seriously , but with only 1 percent of gni -lrb- gross national income -rrb- , it will not be possible to do what these member states – and all others – expect from us . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu question : integrate or separate ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.12.2003 germany 's arms exports under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 550 million small arms are in circulation worldwide .
the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .
but he was also quick to point out that " the credibility of germany 's commitment to tackling the problem on an international level is inextricably linked to its domestic arms policy .

in german lore , the christkind leaves presents under the tree on christmas eve .
but nuremberg brings the christkind down to earth long before the 24th to be one of the biggest attractions at its famous christmas market . being nuremberg ’ s christkind isn ’ t an easy job , but for 17-year-old christin strauber , it ’ s a dream come true . the people of nuremberg vote for the angelic messenger every two years , and for three weeks in december , while the city ’ s christmas market is open , the winner has a packed program . in addition to promotional work and appointments with the media , the christkind carries out public engagements such as visiting schools and hospitals . strauber competed with around 60 other teenage girls for the honor of playing the christkind , and survived both an initial round of internet voting open to all , plus the scrutiny of a jury comprised of nuremberg ’ s heads of marketing and tourism , journalists , and of course , the outgoing christkind . having convinced the jury of her commitment , stamina , as well as acting and singing ability , it was strauber who donned the long dress , blond wig of curls and tall gold crown for the christkind ’ s most important appearance : the official opening of the nuremberg christmas market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's famous christmas market . twice a week , strauber visits the market to read fairytales to the children who gather around a stage . afterwards , they can give the christkind their christmas lists , as in germany , it ’ s the christkind , not santa claus , who traditionally brings the presents on christmas eve . not all fun and games strauber says that not all of her duties are as simple as the story-telling hour with the kids at the christmas market .
“ in hospitals and homes for the elderly , it can often be quite difficult , ” strauber told deutsche welle .
“ i visited a woman who was lying in bed and could hardly open her eyes .
her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .
6 . but as protestants can ’ t have saints , luther needed a new christmas tradition for his followers .
“ luther wanted to move the gift-giving away from the catholic holiday on dec .
6 , ” said nuremberg tourism manager michael weber .
“ so he reinvented the tradition for protestants by moving it to christmas eve and making the christkind – really , the baby jesus – the person who brought the gifts . ” it was under the rule of the national socialists that the image of today ’ s christkind was ultimately anchored in the collective german mind . they built on nuremberg ’ s tradition of producing tinsel angels , and in 1933 , had a young girl in an angel costume open the city ’ s christmas market for the first time . after the second world war , nuremberg ’ s tinsel angels became simply the nuremberg christkind , and the figures were sold nation-wide . for strauber , her time as the nuremberg christkind is a chance to “ spread christian beliefs . ”
she says she tells curious children that the christkind knows about the behavior of every boy and girl , but doesn ’ t punish . that job goes to another german christmas figure , knecht ruprecht , saint nicholaus ’ grumpy sidekick . strauber has already developed tactics to deal with the more sceptical kids that cross her path . when challenged to fly , she tells them that the christkind only flies at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when she 's not playing the christkind , christin strauber is a normal german teenager .
beneath her angelic exterior , though , strauber is still a normal 17-year old , slightly giddy at the sudden fame her new job has brought .
“ i wasn ’ t at all prepared for the media attention , ” she said .
“ it was like being thrown in the deep end . when the vote was announced there were at least six newspaper reporters there and five camera teams .
i ’ m used to it now , but it made me really nervous at first . ” strauber also admits to surfing around a lot more on the internet since she won the vote , just to see where her name pops up . even the christkind , it seems , is allowed a little vanity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas each year , tourists from around the globe flock to germany 's traditional christmas markets .

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .

fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .

but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "

upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .
but he was also quick to point out that " the credibility of germany 's commitment to tackling the problem on an international level is inextricably linked to its domestic arms policy .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .

fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "

german foreign minister joschka fischer is back in the middle east for talks on the situation in iraq and the stalled israeli-palestinian peace process . fischer began this latest visit to the middle east , his fourth this year , in egypt on tuesday before moving onto jordan , israel and the palestinian authority .
during the three-day visit , fischer will hold talks with leaders on the political situation in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amr moussa , right , secretary general of the arab league .
upon arrival in cairo , fischer planned to meet with egypt ’ s president hosni mubarak , his egyptian counterpart ahmed maher and amr moussa , secretary general of the arab league -lrb- with fischer in picture -rrb- , in cairo before moving onto jordan later on tuesday for discussions with marwan moasher , the jordanian foreign minister , in amman .
iraq and peace process on agenda the trip ’ s agenda is expected to be dominated by discussions on the peaceful transfer of power in iraq and ways to help advance the troubled peace process in the region , a topic that fischer is personally committed to .
like its eu partners , germany is a strong supporter of the so-called " road map " for peace drafted by the european union , russia , the united states and united nations , which would create a palestinian state by 2005 dependent on security guarantees for israel .
fischer ’ s willingness to be a familiar face in the region is seen by many in the region as a sign of his , and the eu ’ s , support .
the german foreign minister will conclude his visit with meetings with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and foreign minister silvan shalom on wednesday as well as holding talks with the palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia . eu support for palestinian prime minister ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia .
fischer ’ s decision to meet with qureia holds particular significance as it could well be interpreted as a european union endorsement of his appointment .
a statement from the german foreign ministry went so far as to confirm this by saying that the planned meeting would underscore the importance that the eu attaches to qureia ’ s post . however , one person fischer will not be meeting is palestinian leader yasser arafat .
officially , scheduling problems are the reason arafat is not included in this round of talks .
but there do appear to be other forces at work keeping the two from meeting for the second time this year . sharon exerts pressure over arafat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
ariel sharon was quoted in the german press at the weekend , urging germany and the entire european union to review its relations with arafat and saying that having contact with the symbol of palestinian nationhood " does not contribute to the development of the peace process . "
sharon ’ s administration has recently stepped up its policy of pressuring foreign visiting diplomats to ignore yasser arafat and meet with members of the new palestinian authority government . the pressure on germany increased on the morning before fischer was due to set off on his visit .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany said on monday that the european union needs to shun yasser arafat and show more empathy with israel if it wants to play an influential role in resolving israel 's conflict with the palestinians .
eu should show balance , says envoy " if the europeans are to have a chance in the middle east , in this conflict , it will only be when the israelis perceive that the europeans are n't one-sided and unbalanced but try to show a certain empathy for the situation in which the israelis find themselves , " the envoy told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasser arafat with fischer .
he also echoed sharon ’ s comments by adding that israel would take a dim view if fischer , who met arafat during his last trip in april , were to visit the palestinian president again .
" we do n't believe a meeting with arafat is a positive contribution , but rather the opposite , ” stein said .
“ we see a meeting with arafat as counter-productive . "
however , stein said israelis had higher regard for fischer than they did for the 15-member bloc as a whole .
" he enjoys great respect in israel , but i do n't think that applies to the whole of the european union , " stein said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace .

her husband was trying to feed her , and i couldn ’ t hold back my tears , because it was so obvious how much he loved her , and that she didn ’ t have much longer to live . ” sometimes it ’ s the people she visits who get teary-eyed , so touched are they at the appearance of the christkind , who according to german tradition , is a heavenly messenger from the christ child . the making of a myth the christkind was originally introduced in the 16th century by religious reformer martin luther . until then , it was always saint nicholas who brought gifts on dec .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past .

six eu countries , including germany , france and britain , proposed a cap on the eu budget that would harm member states spain and poland .
the move came two days after the latter two blocked a deal on a new constitution . retribution , it seems , comes quick in the european union .
though not many were saying it on monday , a letter by six eu nations proposing a cap on the eu ’ s € 100 billion -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- budget beginning in 2007 seemed to take direct aim at spain and poland , who many blame for the failure of a weekend summit to agree on a new constitution .
“ they know it , ” german foreign minister joschka fischer said at a news conference , according to the wall street journal .
“ it shouldn ’ t be necessary to say it . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , center , seems to think spain and poland need to bear the consequences of blocking a new eu constitution .
the proposal would limit the amount the eu can spend from 2007 to 2013 to 1 percent of the bloc ’ s gross economic output .
the cap was planned to be at 1.24 percent , or € 25 billion more , and includes money the european commission wanted to spend to increase border security , agricultural subsidies , and subsidies to poorer countries .
the commission – the eu ’ s executive wing – said it would review the new proposal before january . angry reaction from poland spain , which in 2002 received € 8.8 billion in subsidies from the eu , and poland , which was also expecting large subsidies , look to suffer under the new proposal . poland is one of 10 new eu members and will officially join the bloc in may 2004 . officials of the two governments jointly opposed a clause in the eu ’ s draft constitution over the weekend that would redistribute their voting rights and weaken their position in the european commission . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz was not pleased with the new proposal and said on monday that the eu didn ’ t function under the principal of the “ carrot and the stick . ” but government officials in germany , britain , france , austria , the netherlands and sweden insisted that the proposal wasn ’ t any sort of retribution .
chancellor gerhard schröder , in comments that contrasted sharply with his foreign minister , told german television monday that the allocation process couldn ’ t keep going as it had in the past . " we can ’ t operate under the philosophy , every one gets to keep what they had and then we add some more on top for the new countries , ” he said . “ the old eu members , who have profited until now from the eu , must now give to the poorer countries . ” no miracles expected the proposal is going to make life difficult for the european commission as the eu expands to 25 members in may next year .
a commission spokesman said the cuts in eu spending would affect the areas of research and development , law enforcement cooperation and joint border controls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants germany and others to back off on plans to cap eu spending .
commission president romano prodi appeared exasperated at the prospect of working with a smaller budget . “ miracles are not my speciality and they don ’ t seem to come easily to member states either , ” he said in a statement .
“ we will study these ideas seriously , but with only 1 percent of gni -lrb- gross national income -rrb- , it will not be possible to do what these member states – and all others – expect from us . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu question : integrate or separate ?
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ”

the german government approved weapon exports worth some € 3.2 billion -lrb- $ 3.95 billion -rrb- in 2002 , making the country the world ’ s fifth largest arms seller , an annual report has revealed . compared to 2001 , germany ’ s weapon exports decreased by € 400 million - but it ’ s no reason to sound the all-clear , according to the gkke , the joint conference church and development , which compiled the report . the gkke , an ecumenical body of german churches , presented its 2002 findings on weapons exports in berlin , revealing that germany is second only to france when it comes to arms exports from the european union .
it accounts for some 5 percent of the international world arms market . the organization has been publishing its arms export report once a year since 1998 .
the study provides statistical data on german exports of arms and military equipment based on information made publicly available by the german government and other international institutions .
the report also includes analyses and evaluations of current and medium-term trends in german and european arms export and control policies . weapons to trouble spots the latest gkke report criticizes the german government for continuing to approve weapons exports to international trouble spots such as israel .
the report showed that the primary countries buying german arms in 2002 also included india , singapore and south korea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli army also receives weapons from germany , according to the gkke report . a quarter of all exports still go to developing countries , gkke spokesman bernhard moltmann said .
" within this group are generally countries with a higher per-capita income , because generally , german export arms are quite expensive , so poorer countries can ’ t afford them , ” he added .
“ so if german weapons do appear in these poorer countries , they are second-hand . " the china syndrome the organization was especially critical of the german government ’ s stance on future arms exports to china .
on a recent state visit to asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder told chinese premier weng jiabao that he was in favor of lifting the weapons embargo imposed on china 14 years ago after the country ’ s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in bejing ’ s tiananmen square . stephan reimers , who chairs the gkke , said his organization was unhappy with schröder 's decision .
" we don ’ t understand why the german chancellor wants to lift the embargo , ” he said .
“ after all , china fulfils neither german nor eu criteria - which would be the precondition for allowing exports from germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room inside the hanau plutonium plant .
reimers also raised objections to the proposed , controversial export of a german plutonium factory to china .
the siemens plant in hanau in western germany was completed in 1991 and decommissioned four years later without ever being used . the project has led to a heated controversy within germany 's ruling socialist-green coalition over whether berlin , which is phasing out atomic energy at home , should be involved in encouraging the use of nuclear power abroad .
there are also concerns that china might use the plant for military purposes . the threat of small arms speaking in berlin , moltmann addressed another pressing issue - the proliferation of small arms such as revolvers , self-loading pistols , rifles , carbines , sub-machine guns , assault rifles and light machine guns . describing them as " the 21st century 's weapons of mass destruction , " he explained that experts assumed iraq bore responsibility for an increase of small weapons in unstable neighbouring countries . “ when saddam hussein was found in his hide-out he had a loaded kalashnikov , ” moltmann said .
he added that the shots fired by iraqis to celebrate hussein ’ s arrest all came from small weapons .
“ the country is riddled with them , ” he said , adding that an estimated 160 secret weapons depots exist in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi man holds an ak-47 while celebrating news of the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad . moltman said that the german government was involved with commendable programmes under the aegis of the eu and u.n. to crack down on the circulation of small weapons worldwide .

tony blair announced a £ 500,000 department for culture , media and sport grant at a party to celebrate the museum 's 250th anniversary .
and the british council in africa will provide office and staffing resources to help with the proposals .

it is part of the uk government 's response to a report by a committee of mps - which backs key measures in new asylum legislation .
opposition politicians have condemned the decision repeating their argument that dungavel is not a suitable place for children .
welfare needs nine children are currently being held with their families at the dungavel centre , which houses failed asylum seekers and their families before they are deported .
the new measures being put in place by the home office include the need for a government minister to give express authority before a child can be detained for longer than 28 days .
i 'm horrified that ministers are now entrenching their position as a result of the decisions made yesterday john swinney snp leader the educational and welfare needs of any child being kept at dungavel for more than three weeks will also be assessed to make sure they are being met .
home office minister beverley hughes said : " there is concern about children being detained which i hope the measures we are announcing will go some way to alleviating .
" it is only in the very , very tiny minority of cases where , either for reasons of their immigration history or because people have served a prison sentence , that we can not put the parents into the community .
" in that situation we have to make a decision as to what is in the best interests of the children , and i think it is in the interest of the children to be with their parents , albeit that in that small minority of cases that parent has to be detained . "
ms hughes defended the need to detain children but scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- leader john swinney has insisted that children should not be put in dungavel .
mr swinney said : " the government said that children would only be detained there for a couple of days , we now have ministers saying that they will only become involved in these issues if a child has been there for 28 days .
" now i do n't think a child should be there for a single day , that 's my basic position , and i 'm horrified that ministers are now entrenching their position as a result of the decisions made yesterday .
" i think it is immoral in principle for children to be detained in the prison that is dungavel , there are alternatives available in our community to deal with people fairly and squarely . "

with improved access , comes the threat of ever more internet security violations .
as delegates at last week 's un net summit in geneva focused on how information technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor , others highlighted the issue of safe surfing .
" computers and networks are becoming what 's called a utility , " said rheinhold scholl who works with the international telecommunication union , the un group that organised the event .
" a utility is something that you notice when you do n't have it anymore .
and the same is becoming truer for computers and networks .
" if that 's the case , " said mr scholl , " then it 's a prerequisite that computers and networks are secure . "
in other words , the same viruses and worms that can heavily damage computers and networks in the developed world will be able to wreck havoc in developing countries as well .
moreover , countries like brazil and the china are quickly becoming hotbeds for such computer attacks .
and it is going to be all the more difficult for them to stop it .
" developing countries often are among the top sources of attack , but also targets of attacks , " said world bank technology specialist carlos braga .
" developing countries will have to dedicate , at policy level , at the private sector level , and academia will have to invest increasing resources to deal with the complexity of how to address issues of trust in cyber space . "
internet laws that is a tall order for many developing countries .
african delegates especially spoke at length about such problems at the un talks .
they say their governments first and foremost lack the technical know-how to prevent most forms of cyber-crime . "
if current trends persist , the internet will inevitably evolve into a chaotic formation , swamped with tons of different spam messages , myriads of viruses " garry kondakov , kaspersky labs but eugeny shabligin , the director of jet infosystems , an internet security firm based in russia , said it will take more than just technical skill to make computer users across the globe feel secure .
" a very important part of it is the legislation , " he explained .
" without the proper legislation , and even more important , effective enforcement of this legislation , we can not expect the trust between the government and the people . "
that trust is vital .
the internet grew up outside of any kind of world regulatory body .
many experts believe that the net 's slightly anarchic ways are its greatest strength - a source of creativity and innovation .
but cyber-crime , they say , is quickly eroding that trust .
" if current trends persist , the internet will inevitably evolve into a chaotic formation , swamped with tons of different spam messages , myriads of viruses , " said garry kondakov , who kaspersky labs , a russian anti-virus company .
" the home users as well as the various business organisations will refuse to use this global network , as it will become the main source of infections . "
' collective responsibility ' summit negotiators here have tried to make internet security a central pillar of their action plan .
the plan calls for governments to work together , and with the private sector , to coordinate global internet security .
no nation has more of a stake in that than the united states .
america leads the world as the biggest source of , and target for , internet attacks .
" i was particularly pleased to see a reference in the documents themselves to a culture of cyber-security , " said us ambassador david gross , who helps formulate us information technology policy at the state department .
" that reflects our view and the view of the world that security issues are not just the issue of governments , but rather it 's a collective responsibility in the sense that companies , individuals , all have a responsibility to make sure that networks are secure . "
this will no doubt be a weighty burden on many developing countries , made heavier by the lack of a magic formula for net security .
developing nations , it seems , may more or less have to deal with cyber-crime on their own .

security was one of the many issues discussed in geneva as delegates at last week 's un net summit in geneva focused on how information technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor , others highlighted the issue of safe surfing .
" computers and networks are becoming what 's called a utility , " said rheinhold scholl who works with the international telecommunication union , the un group that organised the event .
" a utility is something that you notice when you do n't have it anymore .
and the same is becoming truer for computers and networks .
" if that 's the case , " said mr scholl , " then it 's a prerequisite that computers and networks are secure . "
in other words , the same viruses and worms that can heavily damage computers and networks in the developed world will be able to wreck havoc in developing countries as well .
moreover , countries like brazil and the china are quickly becoming hotbeds for such computer attacks .
and it 's going to be all the more difficult for them to stop it .
" developing countries often are among the top sources of attack , but also targets of attacks , " said world bank technology specialist carlos braga .

african delegates especially spoke at length about such problems at the un talks .

" a very important part of it is the legislation , " he explained .
" without the proper legislation , and even more important , effective enforcement of this legislation , we can not expect the trust between the government and the people . "
that trust is vital .
the internet grew up outside of any kind of world regulatory body .
many experts believe that the net 's slightly anarchic ways are its greatest strength - a source of creativity and innovation .
but cyber-crime , they say , is quickly eroding that trust .

the plan calls for governments to work together , and with the private sector , to coordinate global internet security .

" that reflects our view and the view of the world that security issues are not just the issue of governments , but rather it 's a collective responsibility in the sense that companies , individuals , all have a responsibility to make sure that networks are secure . "
this will no doubt be a weighty burden on many developing countries , make heavier by the lack of magic formula for net security .

research from the 2001 census has shown that the population of the cardiff is 305,300 , but that is significantly below the city council 's own estimate of 327,500 .
the drop means the council could lose about £ 4m a year in government grants , because the money is based on the census figures .
people living in the city could have to make up that shortfall through a 5 % rise in council tax bills .
an independent economic scrutiny committee is now overseeing research carried out by the council .
they are trying to prove that its estimate is more accurate that the census .
and the council could challenge the office of national statistics , which runs the official statistics operation carried out every 10 years , in order for the figures to be changed .
census figures are extensively used in service planning , and have a direct impact on the council 's finances councillor ralph cook chair of the committee , councillor ralph cook explained : " the council is running a research project to investigate the truth of this 22,000 people shortfall on the census .
" we are looking at other statistics like those from doctors ' registers and the council tax register to prove that the council 's figures are more accurate than those of the census .
" grants that we get are based on the population and , according to the census , we are 22,000 people down .
" this means £ 4m less for the council to fund services .
over 10 years that is £ 40m that we will lose .
" if the figures on the census had been closer to those of the council , the council tax bill would be half of what it is now , " he said .
as well as being used to calculate the budget settlement from the welsh assembly , census figures are also used to predict future demand for housing and school places .
westminster in london has also lost thousands of people cardiff is not the only city which seems to have lost some of its population .
in the london borough of westminster , figures were down by 60,000 people , and manchester lost 45,000 people .
" census figures are extensively used in service planning , and have a direct impact on the council 's finances , " said mr cook .
" it worries me when a set of figures which are supposed to be accurate appear to lose twice as many people as registered to vote in my ward of trowbridge .
" the scrutiny of the 2001 census figures is one of the most important reviews this committee has been involved in , as it affects everyone living in cardiff . "
a meeting to discuss the situation is being held on tuesday in cardiff 's county hall at 1630gmt .

the opposition-inspired move was aimed at countering president chen shui-bian 's planned referendum on the issue .
the opposition has argued that a referendum is unnecessary because it is clear that most taiwanese would want china to remove the missiles .
china , which regards taiwan as its territory , is worried that a vote could be seen as a move towards independence .
the ruling democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- and the opposition could not agree on the wording of the resolution so they decided to pass two versions .
the dpp version asked for china to remove the missiles pointed at taiwan and to respect the island 's sovereignty .
the opposition kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- and people first party -lrb- pfp -rrb- version said : " we hope the chinese authorities will not install any new missiles , and gradually remove those that have already been installed . "
" the resolution is meant to dilute the mandate of president chen shui-bian in holding a controversial referendum on the missile issue , " said pfp parliamentarian huang yi-chiao .
" it has already expressed the views and wishes of the taiwanese people , so the proposed missile vote , which has fuelled cross-strait tensions and angered washington , should become unnecessary , " he said .
mr chen has stressed that his " defensive referendum " , planned for 20 march , is aimed at " avoiding war " .
taiwan 's vice president , annette lu , said in a reuters interview on tuesday that the chinese missiles pointing at her island were a form of " state terrorism " .

the opposition-inspired move was aimed at countering president chen shui-bian 's planned referendum on the issue .
the opposition has argued that a referendum is unnecessary because it is clear that most taiwanese would want china to remove the missiles .
china , which regards taiwan as its territory , is worried that a vote could be seen as a move towards independence .
the ruling democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- and the opposition could not agree on the wording of the resolution so they decided to pass two versions .
the dpp version asked for china to remove the missiles pointed at taiwan and to respect the island 's sovereignty .
the opposition kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- and people first party -lrb- pfp -rrb- version said : " we hope the chinese authorities will not install any new missiles , and gradually remove those that have already been installed . "
" the resolution is meant to dilute the mandate of president chen shui-bian in holding a controversial referendum on the missile issue , " said pfp parliamentarian huang yi-chiao .
" it has already expressed the views and wishes of the taiwanese people , so the proposed missile vote , which has fuelled cross-strait tensions and angered washington , should become unnecessary , " he said .
mr chen has stressed that his " defensive referendum " , planned for 20 march , is aimed at " avoiding war " .
taiwan 's vice president , annette lu , said in a reuters interview on tuesday that the chinese missiles pointing at her island were a form of " state terrorism " .
this provoked a strong reaction from beijing .

the group said earnings for 2003 should " be within the range of current market expectations " .
pearson added it expects to see profits at all of its divisions - except its professional unit .
but it did warn advertising revenues at the financial times are set to slide further , declining 15 % over the year .
" though market conditions remain tough for corporate advertising and technology-related businesses , we continue to perform strongly in our markets and are benefiting from further efficiency gains , " a company statement said .
new deals pearson added that its us school and higher education businesses are expected to report good underlying progress , with revenues set to rise by 5-7 % .
but the group predicted its professional division would not do as well as last year , with its us transportation security administration -lrb- tsa -rrb- contract still owed $ 150m -lrb- £ 88m -rrb- for a contract completed last year .
meanwhile , pearson also announced it had won three new contracts , including several us school testing deals worth $ 160m -lrb- £ 94m -rrb- .
it also landed a renewed and expanded 10-year , $ 160m contract with the us department of education for work on student aid schemes , and a nine-year deal to provide testing services to the national association of securities dealers .
in july the firm announced a loss of £ 1m for the first six months of the year , blaming falling sales and advertising revenue for the decline .
