program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2003 germany 's jobless and the self-help solution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployed are catching the global self-help bug germany 's jobless are turning to less traditional approaches in their search for work and as a result , self-help books promising fast-tracks to dream jobs are flying off the shelves . germany 's stubborn unemployment problem , which at 11 percent shows no sign of easing , is forcing often change-wary germans to abandon the traditional methods of searching for work and turn in increasing numbers to " self-help " career books .
these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job centre in germany .
up until now , most germans have gone to the local employment office to look for work , or simply stayed on unemployment , since the welfare state has long promised unlimited and generous benefits .
but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .
however , he told dw-world that the inconsistent quality of some books on the market should be accepted and that the advice contained within should be used along with more reliable sources . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .
their one wish : that peace wins out in the end . the iraqi family feels secure in cologne , the rhine river city with the towering gothic cathedral .
the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .
in the years since then , the country he left has continued to fall apart .
iraq has the world 's highest child mortality rate , says hans von sponeck , the united nations ' former coordinator of humanitarian assistance for iraq .
of 1,000 children , 131 will die before they reach the age of five .
many areas of baghdad have no electricity .
potable water is in short supply throughout the country .
and the literacy rate is the lowest in the world , according to the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization .
" we are suffering from chronic stress , " psychologist hisham hamid recently told the associated press in baghdad 3.5 million refugees expected if a war starts , the situation is expected to become even worse .
the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .
" we want saddam hussein out , " she says .
" but what happens afterward in iraq ?
that is our worry .
because the war is not justified .
the result would be much more dangerous . "
because of such worries , the family also appreciates the opposition to a possible war expressed by schröder .
" we are very pleased about that because war is not a viable alternative to today 's situation , " madhia says . gero rueter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans to serve as ' human shields ' in iraq in an effort to prevent a war from breaking out in iraq , members of a european organization led by a former american soldier are traveling to baghdad to protect buildings and people from bombs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2003 german banks want to pass loan liability to government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a further shadow has settled over germany 's banking landscape .
germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .
in the first federal election following reunification , merkel beat out two west german opponents to win a parliamentary seat in an eastern german constituency in december 1990 .
chancellor helmut kohl quickly took her under his wing . kohl named her to the cabinet post of minister for women and youth affairs the following month .
merkel worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct along the way . the fact that merkel - as a woman , an east german and a protestant - made a career in the cdu was considered a breakthrough in a traditional party with strong catholic roots and a milestone for german women . out of the shadows ironically , merkel profited again when the reins of power moved to gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in the 1998 election .
she was elected secretary general of the cdu and taxed with the responsibility of raising her party out of the immense shadow of helmut kohl - the man who had first plucked her from obscurity . here , she distinguished herself by soon taking advantage of the slush fund campaign finance scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble - calling for a clean break with the past . while the cdu had lost credibility among the electorate because of the scandal , merkel ’ s insistence that party leaders be thoroughly investigated boosted the party ’ s standing and her own .
she was rewarded by being elected the first woman ever to lead the christian democrats in 2000 . the shadow candidate as the party 's chairwoman , merkel tried to re-orient the cdu , focusing on the issues of european integration , globalization , immigration , family and education , while steering toward a centrist political ground .
after a bitter contest to become the cdu 's 2002 candidate for chancellor , merkel bowed out of the race a year ago , leaving that slot open for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who leads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union . political observers said merkel was too thin-skinned , timid and hesitant to deliver her party a victory . though the cdu made significant gains in parliament over the previous election , schröder was narrowly re-elected sept .
22 .
merkel then adroitly side-stepped inner-party opponent friedrich merz and assumed his position as leader of the parliamentary group - a position that made her the bundestag 's minority leader .
at a cdu party conference in november , she was confirmed as party chairwoman , receiving 93.7 percent of delegates votes . merkel passed her next political test with flying colors , too , shedding any remaining doubt about her leadership qualities .
the cdu devastated gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in important state elections in hesse and lower saxony on feb .

although protocol doesn ’ t allow a foreign opposition politician to meet with a u.s. president , the white house has rolled out what the german media is describing as a " pink carpet " for merkel - a status that has opened up doors to the cheneys and rices of washington . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder pounded in two state elections germany 's opposition christian democrats dealt a severe setback to chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in two states on sunday .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .

the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .

they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .

the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .
" we want saddam hussein out , " she says .
" but what happens afterward in iraq ?
that is our worry .
because the war is not justified .
the result would be much more dangerous . "
because of such worries , the family also appreciates the opposition to a possible war expressed by schröder .

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job centre in germany .
up until now , most germans have gone to the local employment office to look for work , or simply stayed on unemployment , since the welfare state has long promised unlimited and generous benefits .
but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresdner bank headquarters in frankfurt .
in the wake of the discussion about ackermann ’ s idea of a " bad bank " , germany ’ s dresdner bank came up with an in-house alternative to state liability for loan risks .
dresdner bank announced monday that it will leave out credit risks and strategically unimportant loans of € 17 billion from its books in a newly created " institutional restructuring unit " -lrb- iru -rrb- .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .

she was elected secretary general of the cdu and taxed with the responsibility of raising her party out of the immense shadow of helmut kohl - the man who had first plucked her from obscurity . here , she distinguished herself by soon taking advantage of the slush fund campaign finance scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble - calling for a clean break with the past . while the cdu had lost credibility among the electorate because of the scandal , merkel ’ s insistence that party leaders be thoroughly investigated boosted the party ’ s standing and her own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2003 germany 's jobless and the self-help solution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's unemployed are catching the global self-help bug germany 's jobless are turning to less traditional approaches in their search for work and as a result , self-help books promising fast-tracks to dream jobs are flying off the shelves . germany 's stubborn unemployment problem , which at 11 percent shows no sign of easing , is forcing often change-wary germans to abandon the traditional methods of searching for work and turn in increasing numbers to " self-help " career books .
these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job centre in germany .
up until now , most germans have gone to the local employment office to look for work , or simply stayed on unemployment , since the welfare state has long promised unlimited and generous benefits .
but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .
however , he told dw-world that the inconsistent quality of some books on the market should be accepted and that the advice contained within should be used along with more reliable sources . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .

the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .
in the years since then , the country he left has continued to fall apart .
iraq has the world 's highest child mortality rate , says hans von sponeck , the united nations ' former coordinator of humanitarian assistance for iraq .
of 1,000 children , 131 will die before they reach the age of five .
many areas of baghdad have no electricity .
potable water is in short supply throughout the country .
and the literacy rate is the lowest in the world , according to the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization .
" we are suffering from chronic stress , " psychologist hisham hamid recently told the associated press in baghdad 3.5 million refugees expected if a war starts , the situation is expected to become even worse .
the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job centre in germany .
up until now , most germans have gone to the local employment office to look for work , or simply stayed on unemployment , since the welfare state has long promised unlimited and generous benefits .
but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .
however , he told dw-world that the inconsistent quality of some books on the market should be accepted and that the advice contained within should be used along with more reliable sources . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresdner bank headquarters in frankfurt .
in the wake of the discussion about ackermann ’ s idea of a " bad bank " , germany ’ s dresdner bank came up with an in-house alternative to state liability for loan risks .
dresdner bank announced monday that it will leave out credit risks and strategically unimportant loans of € 17 billion from its books in a newly created " institutional restructuring unit " -lrb- iru -rrb- .

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .

his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .

dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresdner bank headquarters in frankfurt .
in the wake of the discussion about ackermann ’ s idea of a " bad bank " , germany ’ s dresdner bank came up with an in-house alternative to state liability for loan risks .
dresdner bank announced monday that it will leave out credit risks and strategically unimportant loans of € 17 billion from its books in a newly created " institutional restructuring unit " -lrb- iru -rrb- .

but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .
however , he told dw-world that the inconsistent quality of some books on the market should be accepted and that the advice contained within should be used along with more reliable sources . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's unemployment rate hits five-year high unemployment spread deeper into the german population during january , throwing 398,000 more people out of work .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .

chancellor helmut kohl quickly took her under his wing . kohl named her to the cabinet post of minister for women and youth affairs the following month .
merkel worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct along the way . the fact that merkel - as a woman , an east german and a protestant - made a career in the cdu was considered a breakthrough in a traditional party with strong catholic roots and a milestone for german women . out of the shadows ironically , merkel profited again when the reins of power moved to gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in the 1998 election .

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .
their one wish : that peace wins out in the end . the iraqi family feels secure in cologne , the rhine river city with the towering gothic cathedral .
the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .
in the years since then , the country he left has continued to fall apart .
iraq has the world 's highest child mortality rate , says hans von sponeck , the united nations ' former coordinator of humanitarian assistance for iraq .
of 1,000 children , 131 will die before they reach the age of five .
many areas of baghdad have no electricity .
potable water is in short supply throughout the country .
and the literacy rate is the lowest in the world , according to the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization .
" we are suffering from chronic stress , " psychologist hisham hamid recently told the associated press in baghdad 3.5 million refugees expected if a war starts , the situation is expected to become even worse .
the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .
" we want saddam hussein out , " she says .
" but what happens afterward in iraq ?
that is our worry .
because the war is not justified .
the result would be much more dangerous . "
because of such worries , the family also appreciates the opposition to a possible war expressed by schröder .
" we are very pleased about that because war is not a viable alternative to today 's situation , " madhia says . gero rueter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans to serve as ' human shields ' in iraq in an effort to prevent a war from breaking out in iraq , members of a european organization led by a former american soldier are traveling to baghdad to protect buildings and people from bombs .

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .

up until now , most germans have gone to the local employment office to look for work , or simply stayed on unemployment , since the welfare state has long promised unlimited and generous benefits .
but as germany slowly moves toward reforming the benefits system it can no longer afford , some see the writing on the wall .
jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .
around one third of the clients that visit hesse / schrader career consultants have already read a self-help career book .
perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .

under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .
in the years since then , the country he left has continued to fall apart .
iraq has the world 's highest child mortality rate , says hans von sponeck , the united nations ' former coordinator of humanitarian assistance for iraq .
of 1,000 children , 131 will die before they reach the age of five .
many areas of baghdad have no electricity .
potable water is in short supply throughout the country .
and the literacy rate is the lowest in the world , according to the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization .
" we are suffering from chronic stress , " psychologist hisham hamid recently told the associated press in baghdad 3.5 million refugees expected if a war starts , the situation is expected to become even worse .
the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .
" we want saddam hussein out , " she says .
" but what happens afterward in iraq ?
that is our worry .
because the war is not justified .
the result would be much more dangerous . "
because of such worries , the family also appreciates the opposition to a possible war expressed by schröder .
" we are very pleased about that because war is not a viable alternative to today 's situation , " madhia says . gero rueter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans to serve as ' human shields ' in iraq in an effort to prevent a war from breaking out in iraq , members of a european organization led by a former american soldier are traveling to baghdad to protect buildings and people from bombs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2003 german banks want to pass loan liability to government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a further shadow has settled over germany 's banking landscape .
germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann .
the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .
report is speculation say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel .
meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .
the professor also insisted there was no crisis in the sector and " no reason to panic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresdner bank headquarters in frankfurt .
in the wake of the discussion about ackermann ’ s idea of a " bad bank " , germany ’ s dresdner bank came up with an in-house alternative to state liability for loan risks .
dresdner bank announced monday that it will leave out credit risks and strategically unimportant loans of € 17 billion from its books in a newly created " institutional restructuring unit " -lrb- iru -rrb- .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .
in the first federal election following reunification , merkel beat out two west german opponents to win a parliamentary seat in an eastern german constituency in december 1990 .
chancellor helmut kohl quickly took her under his wing . kohl named her to the cabinet post of minister for women and youth affairs the following month .
merkel worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct along the way . the fact that merkel - as a woman , an east german and a protestant - made a career in the cdu was considered a breakthrough in a traditional party with strong catholic roots and a milestone for german women . out of the shadows ironically , merkel profited again when the reins of power moved to gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in the 1998 election .
she was elected secretary general of the cdu and taxed with the responsibility of raising her party out of the immense shadow of helmut kohl - the man who had first plucked her from obscurity . here , she distinguished herself by soon taking advantage of the slush fund campaign finance scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble - calling for a clean break with the past . while the cdu had lost credibility among the electorate because of the scandal , merkel ’ s insistence that party leaders be thoroughly investigated boosted the party ’ s standing and her own .
she was rewarded by being elected the first woman ever to lead the christian democrats in 2000 . the shadow candidate as the party 's chairwoman , merkel tried to re-orient the cdu , focusing on the issues of european integration , globalization , immigration , family and education , while steering toward a centrist political ground .
after a bitter contest to become the cdu 's 2002 candidate for chancellor , merkel bowed out of the race a year ago , leaving that slot open for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who leads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union . political observers said merkel was too thin-skinned , timid and hesitant to deliver her party a victory . though the cdu made significant gains in parliament over the previous election , schröder was narrowly re-elected sept .
22 .
merkel then adroitly side-stepped inner-party opponent friedrich merz and assumed his position as leader of the parliamentary group - a position that made her the bundestag 's minority leader .
at a cdu party conference in november , she was confirmed as party chairwoman , receiving 93.7 percent of delegates votes . merkel passed her next political test with flying colors , too , shedding any remaining doubt about her leadership qualities .
the cdu devastated gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in important state elections in hesse and lower saxony on feb .
2 . first female chancellor ? in washington on monday , merkel harshly criticized the german government for its pacifist position in the iraq conflict , as well as the deterioration in german-american relations that has accompanied it .
although protocol doesn ’ t allow a foreign opposition politician to meet with a u.s. president , the white house has rolled out what the german media is describing as a " pink carpet " for merkel - a status that has opened up doors to the cheneys and rices of washington . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder pounded in two state elections germany 's opposition christian democrats dealt a severe setback to chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in two states on sunday .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .
in the first federal election following reunification , merkel beat out two west german opponents to win a parliamentary seat in an eastern german constituency in december 1990 .
chancellor helmut kohl quickly took her under his wing . kohl named her to the cabinet post of minister for women and youth affairs the following month .
merkel worked her way through various political posts , including a stint as environment minister , honing her political instinct along the way . the fact that merkel - as a woman , an east german and a protestant - made a career in the cdu was considered a breakthrough in a traditional party with strong catholic roots and a milestone for german women . out of the shadows ironically , merkel profited again when the reins of power moved to gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in the 1998 election .
she was elected secretary general of the cdu and taxed with the responsibility of raising her party out of the immense shadow of helmut kohl - the man who had first plucked her from obscurity . here , she distinguished herself by soon taking advantage of the slush fund campaign finance scandal surrounding kohl and then party chairman wolfgang schäuble - calling for a clean break with the past . while the cdu had lost credibility among the electorate because of the scandal , merkel ’ s insistence that party leaders be thoroughly investigated boosted the party ’ s standing and her own .
she was rewarded by being elected the first woman ever to lead the christian democrats in 2000 . the shadow candidate as the party 's chairwoman , merkel tried to re-orient the cdu , focusing on the issues of european integration , globalization , immigration , family and education , while steering toward a centrist political ground .
after a bitter contest to become the cdu 's 2002 candidate for chancellor , merkel bowed out of the race a year ago , leaving that slot open for bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who leads the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union . political observers said merkel was too thin-skinned , timid and hesitant to deliver her party a victory . though the cdu made significant gains in parliament over the previous election , schröder was narrowly re-elected sept .
22 .
merkel then adroitly side-stepped inner-party opponent friedrich merz and assumed his position as leader of the parliamentary group - a position that made her the bundestag 's minority leader .
at a cdu party conference in november , she was confirmed as party chairwoman , receiving 93.7 percent of delegates votes . merkel passed her next political test with flying colors , too , shedding any remaining doubt about her leadership qualities .
the cdu devastated gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats in important state elections in hesse and lower saxony on feb .
2 . first female chancellor ? in washington on monday , merkel harshly criticized the german government for its pacifist position in the iraq conflict , as well as the deterioration in german-american relations that has accompanied it .
although protocol doesn ’ t allow a foreign opposition politician to meet with a u.s. president , the white house has rolled out what the german media is describing as a " pink carpet " for merkel - a status that has opened up doors to the cheneys and rices of washington . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder pounded in two state elections germany 's opposition christian democrats dealt a severe setback to chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in two states on sunday .

germany ’ s biggest banks have created controversy by allegedly calling upon the federal government to create a special company to take responsibility for their damaged credit ratings . reports in the german press suggest that the heads of many of the country 's biggest banking companies have met with high-ranking government officials to discuss the creation of an institution that will take on liability for loan risks .
according to a report in the german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , a recent meeting was held to discuss the creation of a " bad bank " company in which german banks with bad credit could store their debts .
the report say that those present at the meeting included chancellor gerhard schröder , josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , key cabinet ministers and officials from the banking and insurance sectors .
" bad bank " would pass liability to the government the creation of this " bad bank " would pass liability from the banks to the government and allow the banks to trade without blacklisted credit ratings that have been deterring potential customers .

the paper reports that ackermann suggested that the federal government should take liability for credit risks in order to ease the pressure on banks .
this special state-financed " company " should help rescue cash-strapped banks and take responsibility for their debts , ackermann said .
the article states that banking officials present at the meeting reported that the " bad bank " was to take over risk provisions on debts worth € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- from dresdner bank , commerzbank and hypo-vereinsbank .
according to ackermann , deutsche bank itself does not want to get involved with a project made up of financially damaged banks .
" we don ’ t want to catch the virus , " he said .
deutsche bank officials said monday the bank intends to systematically hedge against potential losses on its loan portfolio in future after it was forced to raise risk provisions to record levels of € 2.1 billion last year .

meanwhile , both the finance ministry in berlin and the bundesbank in frankfurt strictly dismissed the report as " speculation " and insisted the german banking sector was not in crisis .
" we do n't see it that way , " a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel said .
leading frankfurt banking officials said they were shocked by rumors of the creation of a " bad bank " .
calling for help from the state in a time of crisis would only indicate that the private german financial sector was unable to find solutions to homemade problems itself , one official said .
no need for government help bundesbank director edgar meister was confident that the banks didn ’ t need a state-financed emergency plan and were able to manage on their own .
" i 'm not aware of a government plan and i do n't think german banks have the need of one , " he said in an official statement .
meister said he , too , saw no evidence of a banking crisis .
" i 'm confident regarding the capacity of german banks to overcome the difficulties on their own , " he said .
meister admitted that german banks had had " a bad year " and that prospects for 2003 were not much better .
banks were currently developing projects of their own to get themselves out of the danger of loan risks , meister continued .
" the banks are undertaking enormous efforts to stabilize their finances , " he said .
nationalization of credit liability " unacceptable " an expert for banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen / nuremberg , professor wolfgang gerke , said such a proposition for a nationalization of credit liability would be unacceptable , anyway .
not only did it go against the principles of the free market , but it would send a " fatal signal " because it would cast doubt over the stability of banks , gerke argued .

german opposition leader angela merkel is in washington for top-level meetings with bush administration officials aimed at showing not all germans think the way that the country 's chancellor does . angela merkel is making a name for herself - this time outside of germany .
until this week , the chairwoman of the opposition christian democratic union and its parliamentary group in the bundestag was largely unknown in foreign political circles . but a widely read commentary in the washington post published under the headline , " schröder doesn ’ t speak for all germans , " along with a whirlwind diplomatic tour of some of the u.s. capital 's most-important addresses , has done much to raise her profile .
this week , merkel has met top government representatives in washington , including vice president dick cheney , defense secretary donald rumsfeld and national security adviser condoleezza rice . stabbing german peace policies in the back ? far across the atlantic , the 48-year-old has come under withering criticism from leaders of the governing social democratic and green parties , who have accused her of undermining chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s anti-war policy on iraq .
“ once again she is stabbing german peace policies in the back abroad , ” social democrat secretary general olaf scholz said .
the associated press even described her visit as " unusually high-profile for a foreign opposition leader . " while germany favors allowing united nations weapons inspectors more time and a greater scope to continue their search for weapons of mass destruction in saddam hussein ’ s country , merkel said in washington that she believes the united states is on the right track in its efforts to work toward passage of a second u.n. security council resolution legitimizing a military offensive against iraq . straight to the top after a meteoric rise to the top , merkel is well-versed in taking advantage of her opponents ’ weaknesses , and many view her as the first woman in germany with a serious shot of one day leading the country . the pastor ’ s daughter and former physicist from the eastern german state of brandenburg first got into politics working for an east german organization under the aegis of the protestant church in late 1989 , shortly before german reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl after joining the christian democratic union in 1990 , she quickly worked her way up through the party apparatus .

these days , publications offering advice to the jobless on how to market themselves or acquire new skills have become surprise publishing hits .
data from frankfurt publishers campus verlag , the german company responsible for the distribution of american author richard nelson bolles ' book , " restart your dream job , " says that more than 120,000 copies of his book have been sold in germany .
" we already feel , since the autumn of last year , that the interest in our management and career reference books has sharply climbed , " said a spokesperson for the publishing house in a statement to the german press agency dpa .
dr. joachim stauder , the vice president of the federal association of german management consultants -lrb- bdu -rrb- , told dw-world that the boom in popularity may , in some part , be down to the increasing amount of unemployed " white collar " workers in germany .
dr. stauder said , " these people know a lot more about their career potential and know what they want . "
he added that those made redundant from management level jobs are more likely to search for a way to best help themselves , something the new flood of books offer .
books focus on improving marketability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a ticket and wait your turn .
competition in the german job market is such that technical knowledge and social skills have become highly sought-after commodities .
anything that improves and expands these is an advantage in searching for work in today 's tough market .
this has not gone unnoticed by authors of self-help bibles like sabine hertwig -lrb- " competitive tips for the management level " -rrb- and bolles , who have suddenly found a receptive , growing , and paying audience for their work .

jacket quotes on some of the best sellers reflect this .
" when you ca n't find a job through the traditional methods , " reads one , " then you are personally responsible - not the government , not the job agencies . "
no panacea however , moving away from the government job search services and employment agencies completely may not be the sole answer to the problem of finding work , according to klaus reiners , a spokesperson for the bdu .
while he understands why germany 's unemployed are increasingly putting their trust in career gurus and their advice , " such reference books only qualify as a starting point , " he said in an interview with the german press agency dpa .
his appraisal of the abundance of new titles is that the information and approach presented in them are often superficial .
while they are good at pointing out trends in the job market and " not bad " as a source of reference and information , he said they could not replace expert analysis and personal counselling .
dr. stauder agrees .
in his opinion these books are not an alternative to traditional job searching practices .
" while britain and the u.s. have had such books for a while , they have only arrived in germany in the past five years .
they are very different and offer individual stories of personal experience that may not be relevant to many job seekers here . "
career guides appeal to a wide audience petra göhl , a spokesperson for hesse / schrader , a company which runs a national chain of career consultancies , told dpa that self-help career books had " wide appeal " and were useful for those searching for jobs in the current employment climate .
by putting the power in the hands of the individual , the books play an important role in the development of the job searcher , said göhl .

perhaps not surprisingly , the resident psychologists and founders of the consultancy chain , jürgen hesse and hans christian schrader , have their own book on the market , " the occupation brochure , " which is now a best seller .
dr. stauder of the bdu agrees that the books can help position the job seeker in the market , by identifying strengths and weaknesses and offering advice on interviews and presentation .

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .
their one wish : that peace wins out in the end . the iraqi family feels secure in cologne , the rhine river city with the towering gothic cathedral .
the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "
the 42-year-old mohamed , madhia and their three children live in cologne as political refugees .
he was forced to flee iraq eight years ago after the iraqi secret service caught him conducting political activity .
in the years since then , the country he left has continued to fall apart .
iraq has the world 's highest child mortality rate , says hans von sponeck , the united nations ' former coordinator of humanitarian assistance for iraq .
of 1,000 children , 131 will die before they reach the age of five .
many areas of baghdad have no electricity .
potable water is in short supply throughout the country .
and the literacy rate is the lowest in the world , according to the united nations educational , scientific and cultural organization .
" we are suffering from chronic stress , " psychologist hisham hamid recently told the associated press in baghdad 3.5 million refugees expected if a war starts , the situation is expected to become even worse .
the united nations predicts that at least 10 million people in iraq would need to be supplied with food assistance .
every second iraqi would not have potable water , and up to 3.5 million people could become refugees .
suspecting that such troubles lie ahead , madhia says she opposes any armed overthrow of saddam .
" we want saddam hussein out , " she says .
" but what happens afterward in iraq ?
that is our worry .
because the war is not justified .
the result would be much more dangerous . "
because of such worries , the family also appreciates the opposition to a possible war expressed by schröder .
" we are very pleased about that because war is not a viable alternative to today 's situation , " madhia says . gero rueter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans to serve as ' human shields ' in iraq in an effort to prevent a war from breaking out in iraq , members of a european organization led by a former american soldier are traveling to baghdad to protect buildings and people from bombs .

the iraqi family has settled in germany , but their thoughts remain on their homeland as war draws near .
their one wish : that peace wins out in the end . the iraqi family feels secure in cologne , the rhine river city with the towering gothic cathedral .
the husband and wife have jobs as agricultural specialists .
they live in a modestly furnished apartment in a high-rise building .
and their three children are working their way through the german school system .
but one fear hangs over their lives - the fear that the regime of saddam hussein could harm the relatives they left behind in iraq .
so , they say that they will agree to talk with dw-world about their country only under the condition that their surnames are not published .
they prefer to be called just mohamed and madhia .
under this veil of protection , they have much to say about life in iraq today , their worries about a possible war and their thoughts about chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the call to arms that u.s. president george w. bush is likely to issue .
fear of saddam , not war " we call our families in iraq regularly , " mohamed says .
" and i have to be honest with you : they are not afraid of a war because they have experience with war .
but they are afraid of saddam hussein and how he will react if a war begins .
they are afraid he will respond with chemical weapons , and that really troubles us . "

senior doctors from maternity units across the uk were surveyed by bbc radio 4 's file on four programme .
about 280 patients suffered in the last year due to consultant shortages , according to doctors who replied to the survey of members of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists .
of more than 700 consultants who responded , half admitted the standard of care on their wards was less safe in the early hours of the morning than in the evening .
we really have to push hard for a senior consultant presence on wards 24 hours a day in big units maggie blott maggie blott , a consultant at king 's college hospital , london , who represents the royal college , said : " several studies have now shown that sub-standard care in labour has contributed to poor outcomes , and the deaths of babies and mothers .
" this is mainly because of failure to recognise a problem , failure to act on a problem , poor communication , and failure to contact senior staff .
" i think we really have to push hard for a senior consultant presence on wards 24 hours a day in big units . "
ms blott said part of the problem was that it was very difficult to predict problems with childbirth .
" i can be sitting on my labour ward drinking a cup of coffee , and the next minute there can be a catastrophic problem such as a difficulty delivering a baby that needs immediate action . "
health minister jacqui smith said an extra 470 trained specialists would be available to take up posts by 2004 .
" i would not want women going away with the impression that they are not safe in the nhs , " she said .
guidelines ' not met ' " they are as safe as they can be but we are working to make sure they are even safer . "
however , the nhs litigation authority is concerned about the mounting clinical negligence bill over childbirth which currently stands at £ 3.5bn.
the authority has given hospitals guidelines for consultant cover which are designed to reduce this risk .
but half of those who replied who work in the largest units said their hospital did not meet them .
until they do , hospitals will be paying higher insurance premiums - and mothers and babies will continue to be at risk .
recent studies have shown women and their babies are more likely to die during labour in the nhs because of major medical blunders than women in other european countries .

under the plan , 20 out of every 21 common hynix shares will be cancelled , a move that will cut the face value of the company 's share capital to 1.3 trillion won -lrb- £ 690m ; $ 1.1bn -rrb- from 26.2 trillion .
this will pave the way for a debt-equity swap , allowing creditors to take control of the company .
the deal was pushed through in the face of opposition from minority shareholders , whose interests in the firm have effectively been nullified .
brighter future ?
minority shareholders said they would be taking legal action to reverse the decision .
but with creditors already holding the majority of hynix 's voting stock , they seem to have little leverage to change company strategy .
creditors have argued that only drastic action can save hynix , the world 's third-largest producer of memory chips .
the firm 's future has rested on a knife-edge since it rejected a takeover by us rival micron last april , despite suffering an acute shortage of cash in a desperately weak market .
some analysts have argued that it would make more sense to allow hynix to fail , rather than devoting time and effort to a risky rescue plan .

the aussie - as foreign exchange traders call the dollar - has risen by 8 % against the us currency this year , mainly because australian interest rates are 3.5 percentage points higher than what can be earned in the us .
underpinning those high rates is one of the liveliest economies in the developed world , one that has yet to suffer from the global economic slowdown .
" the aussie 's new rippled physique can be attributed to higher commodity prices , a weak greenback and australia 's relatively high interest rates and firm domestic economy , " said craig james of commonwealth securities .
the government currently forecasts the australian economy to grow by 3.75 % this year , way in excess of the average likely in europe or the us .
southern hemisphere safe haven like a handful of other rich-country currencies - notably the swiss franc - the aussie has benefited from doubts over the euro .
jitters over the us dollar , sparked by a combination of recession and terrorism fears , have benefited the european currency - but many traders have looked elsewhere for a safe haven .
anchored by firm prices for the commodities its exports , australia has become a natural home for the nervous .
this rebound goes some way to reverse a five-year decline in the aussie , which in late 1996 was worth as much as us $ 0.82 .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the currency was persistently weak on the international markets , a fact that helped australian exporters prosper , laying the foundations for the country 's current success .
good news for all ?
now , analysts feel even a resurgence in the us dollar need not be bad news for the aussie .
" a rally in the us dollar is likely to be associated with a rebound in global growth confidence , probably coincident with a rally in equity prices , " which would in turn boost australian growth , said greg gibbs of rbc capital markets .
the most negative case for the currency , mr gibbs said , would be a " long and protracted war and a persistently high oil price that significantly undermines the global economic outlook and drives commodity prices lower " .

chief superintendent bob pattison is head of operational support with northumbria police .
he has been liaising closely with wansbeck mp denis murphy who is campaigning for tougher sentences following the death of six-year-old rebecca sawyer .
she died when her family 's car was hit by a man driving a stolen car in ashington , northumberland , on new year 's eve 2002 .
ian carr , 27 , from ashington , was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison after admitting causing death by dangerous driving .
carr had 89 previous convictions and had been banned from driving several times .
ultimately it would be a matter for parliament , but a maximum of life would not be inappropriate in my opinion chief superintendent bob pattison mr pattison said he welcomed plans for tougher sentences but could not support calls for an offence of " motor manslaughter " .
he called for a charge of " aggravated death by dangerous driving " be introduced .
mr pattison said : " the offence termed ' motor manslaughter ' was used many years ago but was found not to work .
" this led to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving being introduced instead .
" the offence of manslaughter does still exist and in cases of causing death by dangerous driving the cps always look to see whether there is enough evidence for a manslaughter charge . "
' increased powers ' mr pattison said a charge of aggravated death by dangerous driving would send out a " clear message " to people who should not be behind the wheel .
he added : " aggravating factors could include driving whilst disqualified , failing to stop for police , driving under the influence of drink and drugs , having no insurance or driving a stolen vehicle , plus having previous convictions for similar offences .
" if this offence was created judges would then have increased sentencing powers , above that for standard death by dangerous driving offences .
" ultimately it would be a matter for parliament , but a maximum of life would not be inappropriate in my opinion . "
