program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election boosts right-wing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even half of switzerland 's voters went to the polls on sunday .
the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voted against the plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racism overshadows swiss elections the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .

the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2003 pension cuts draw fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .
gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .

otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .
" people find it hard to get a job when they ’ re 50 .
who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .
the association ’ s chief walter hirrlinger warned that the government would feel the anger of the country ’ s 20 million pensioners , announcing large-scale protest actions .
“ pensioners will know how to react at the ballot box , ” he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retire later ?

" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .

the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .

the ksk , germany 's equivalent to britain 's sas and the u.s. delta force , had a mandate which runs out on 15 november and can only be extended by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election upsets traditional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher , head of the swiss people 's party , was the clear winner on sunday 's election .
switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .
this considerably limits the parties ’ ability to push through their own agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election boosts right-wing the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .
the association ’ s chief walter hirrlinger warned that the government would feel the anger of the country ’ s 20 million pensioners , announcing large-scale protest actions .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .
this considerably limits the parties ’ ability to push through their own agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election boosts right-wing the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .

the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .
" people find it hard to get a job when they ’ re 50 .
who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .
the association ’ s chief walter hirrlinger warned that the government would feel the anger of the country ’ s 20 million pensioners , announcing large-scale protest actions .
“ pensioners will know how to react at the ballot box , ” he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retire later ?

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .
traian basescu from the opposition center-left party , pd , told reuters that the departure of the ministers was " a desperate attempt to rescue the party 's image after it forged the referendum .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.10.2003 romanian vote a step on path to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many romanians were reluctant to cast ballots in what was seen as a vote of confidence in the government a romanian referendum aimed at preparing the country 's constitution for european union membership reached the needed voter turnout level sunday , but results are n't expected till later this week . romania 's electoral committee confirmed on monday that some 54 percent of the electorate cast ballots after the referendum was extended an extra day in an effort to attract greater participation . in the referendum , the people of romania were asked to vote on amendments to the constitution which would help bring the country in line with the laws of the european union .
amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .
traian basescu from the opposition center-left party , pd , told reuters that the departure of the ministers was " a desperate attempt to rescue the party 's image after it forged the referendum .

the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .

the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .

initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .
traian basescu from the opposition center-left party , pd , told reuters that the departure of the ministers was " a desperate attempt to rescue the party 's image after it forged the referendum .

several german web sites have the perfect alibi for you , at a price . the busiest it 's gotten , says stefan eiben , was when one of a client planned a surprise wedding and needed two months worth of excuses to stave off his wife-to-be . his company , alibi-strohmann.de , had to evade the questions of an increasingly investigative fiancée and think up some real whoppers in order to keep their man in the clear . " that was a stressful time for us , " eiben told deutsche welle . the alibis held just long enough and eiben has been able to put together a humming little business . his is one of several german-language web sites offering covers for people wanting to dodge a meeting , a relative or a spouse . the permanent-alibi for prices ranging from € 20 to € 1,200 , eiben offers a wide-range of services that ensures his clients will never be tracked down .
his company sends out fake invitations to clients .
if a spouse or someone wants to reach them , one of his employees answers the phone number left by the client and promises to pass the message on to the client . alibi-strohmann.de also offers to go shopping or book vacations for their clients , to ensure anonymity .
the most expensive alibi , the permanent-alibi , staves off inquiries for a full year .
clients become employees of an imaginary company , receiving a package complete with business cards .
when the unwanted person wants to reach them , a " secretary " informs them that the client is unreachable . his company also works with real-life companies , who can make an alibi even tighter . " only the company owner is in on it , " says eiben .
" the secretary knows nothing about it .
to her , our client is just a normal business partner . " for those interested in cheating on their current partners , alibi services ensure that hotel bills do n't land in the mailbox , and provide iron-clad alibis for cheating hearts . one might think the providers of such services suffer just a bit over the fact that they are essentially bold-faced liars helping out in what might be a tragic deception .
but jens schlingensief , who runs perfektes-alibi.de , is not bothered by such thoughts . " lies , necessary lies , you can discuss that for a long time , " schlingensief said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.10.2003 businesses predict economic growth in 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports will be the engine behind the germany recovery , according to a new report .
an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .

" but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .

romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election upsets traditional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher , head of the swiss people 's party , was the clear winner on sunday 's election .
switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .
this considerably limits the parties ’ ability to push through their own agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election boosts right-wing the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.10.2003 businesses predict economic growth in 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports will be the engine behind the germany recovery , according to a new report .
an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

alibi services ensure letters and receipts do n't stay in your pocket .
ever gone out with the ex one night only to have the current love asks where you were ?
several german web sites have the perfect alibi for you , at a price . the busiest it 's gotten , says stefan eiben , was when one of a client planned a surprise wedding and needed two months worth of excuses to stave off his wife-to-be . his company , alibi-strohmann.de , had to evade the questions of an increasingly investigative fiancée and think up some real whoppers in order to keep their man in the clear . " that was a stressful time for us , " eiben told deutsche welle . the alibis held just long enough and eiben has been able to put together a humming little business . his is one of several german-language web sites offering covers for people wanting to dodge a meeting , a relative or a spouse . the permanent-alibi for prices ranging from € 20 to € 1,200 , eiben offers a wide-range of services that ensures his clients will never be tracked down .
his company sends out fake invitations to clients .
if a spouse or someone wants to reach them , one of his employees answers the phone number left by the client and promises to pass the message on to the client . alibi-strohmann.de also offers to go shopping or book vacations for their clients , to ensure anonymity .
the most expensive alibi , the permanent-alibi , staves off inquiries for a full year .
clients become employees of an imaginary company , receiving a package complete with business cards .
when the unwanted person wants to reach them , a " secretary " informs them that the client is unreachable . his company also works with real-life companies , who can make an alibi even tighter . " only the company owner is in on it , " says eiben .
" the secretary knows nothing about it .
to her , our client is just a normal business partner . " for those interested in cheating on their current partners , alibi services ensure that hotel bills do n't land in the mailbox , and provide iron-clad alibis for cheating hearts . one might think the providers of such services suffer just a bit over the fact that they are essentially bold-faced liars helping out in what might be a tragic deception .
but jens schlingensief , who runs perfektes-alibi.de , is not bothered by such thoughts . " lies , necessary lies , you can discuss that for a long time , " schlingensief said .

the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election upsets traditional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher , head of the swiss people 's party , was the clear winner on sunday 's election .
switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .

the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.10.2003 romanian vote a step on path to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many romanians were reluctant to cast ballots in what was seen as a vote of confidence in the government a romanian referendum aimed at preparing the country 's constitution for european union membership reached the needed voter turnout level sunday , but results are n't expected till later this week . romania 's electoral committee confirmed on monday that some 54 percent of the electorate cast ballots after the referendum was extended an extra day in an effort to attract greater participation . in the referendum , the people of romania were asked to vote on amendments to the constitution which would help bring the country in line with the laws of the european union .
amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election boosts right-wing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even half of switzerland 's voters went to the polls on sunday .
the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voted against the plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racism overshadows swiss elections the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .

a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .

most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .

with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .
traian basescu from the opposition center-left party , pd , told reuters that the departure of the ministers was " a desperate attempt to rescue the party 's image after it forged the referendum .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .

unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voted against the plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racism overshadows swiss elections the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.10.2003 swiss election upsets traditional stability großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher , head of the swiss people 's party , was the clear winner on sunday 's election .
switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .

on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .

the vote for a new parliament in switzerland has resulted in an upset unheard of for decades .
the right-wing people 's party with its isolationist policies has triumphed at the polls . swiss voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament on sunday .
most of those who were interested cast their ballots by mail .
but not many were interested .
only 43 percent of the 4.7 million voters were expected to cast a ballot at all , low turnout for a european democracy . the swiss are n't necessarily apathetic towards voting .
perhaps it 's just difficult to get excited when the same parties have been in government for so long .
the left-leaning social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- , the business-minded radical party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- have each held three cabinet seats since 1959 .
the then-smaller right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- made do with the seventh cabinet seat .
called the " magic formula , " the four-party coalition has been the status quo ever since . but that may yet change .
initial results say the people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- will win the largest share of power in the election .
party leaders have already said they will claim another cabinet seat at the likely expense of the christian democrats , whose fortunes appear to be waning .
projected results on sunday evening gave the people ’ s party a 27.2 percent share of the vote ; the social democrats had 23.3 percent , the radicals 16.8 percent and the christian democrats 14.3 percent .
final results will be published on monday after all votes have been counted . no short-term change despite the svp 's win , some analysts say the party may not gain the second cabinet position it covets when parliament chooses the cabinet in december .
" i do n't think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the ' magic formula , " ' political analyst hans hirter told swiss radio international .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people 's party 's bid for a second government seat . " but swiss observers point out that in their direct democracy , power rests not with parliament but with the people .
four times a year voters are summoned for referendums in which they have the final say on policy issues . consolidating support nevertheless , the svp may continue to mobilize supporters with its isolationist policies which oppose switzerland joining the eu and call for tougher asylum laws . the party provoked controversy in the last few weeks with an aggressive poster campaign suggesting that immigrants were criminals .
the first poster featured a caricatured black face and a slogan reading , " the swiss are increasingly becoming the negros . "
following widespread criticism the poster was withdrawn . in 2001 , the people 's party sponsored a proposal to create tougher asylum laws aimed at discouraging economic migrants .
the nationwide referendum was narrowly defeated with just 50.1 percent of the swiss voted against the plan . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racism overshadows swiss elections the swiss elections are taking on a racist overtone , as the far-right exploits fears about the rising number of immigrants .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .

an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump . the revival of global trade and the demand for german goods has led the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- to tentatively announce that the german economy will recover in 2004 following a crippling three-year slump that has driven unemployment near the 4.5 million mark .
a survey conducted by dihk of more than 25,000 of the 3 million , mostly small and medium-sized companies that the association represents , shows that the share of managers who expect business to get better increased to 29 percent in october from 17 percent in the last survey in june .
september ’ s survey polled companies from industry , the service sector , trade and construction .
the accompanying report states that “ the persistent stagnation of the german economy is tapering off this autumn .
exports , the engine for growth , will get back in gear again . ”
economic growth of 2 percent possible it also states that growth of 2 percent is a possibility in 2004 , depending on the reaction to the government 's social reforms and the strength of the dollar , among other factors .
the report shows that around 40 percent of the companies surveyed said they expected exports to rise , up from 27 percent in june .
according to the dihk report , german consumers are likely to buy more durable goods such as dishwashers , and companies may replace more machines and tools next year , underpinning the recovery .
ernst welteke , the president of the bundesbank , added to the cautious good news by releasing a statement saying germany 's $ 2.3 trillion economy had recovered from its second recession in two years in the third quarter of this year , expanding by about 0.2 percent .
dollar may play its part the dihk offered a word of warning on the back of this news by adding that this recovery may falter should the strong euro extend its 20 percent gain against the u.s. dollar .
fluctuations in the dollar may lead to an “ uneven ” pickup of german growth , the dihk cautioned .
exports account for about a third of the german economy , europe 's largest , with one-tenth of german sales abroad going to the united states .
germany ’ s performance depends more on a u.s. recovery than on exchange rates , a study by the halle institute for economic research stated . unemployment still problematic while the economic news remains on the optimistic side , the dihk added that unemployment factors would continue to give germany problems in the next 12 months .
while companies will stop cutting jobs next year , hiring wo n't be enough to raise employment above this year 's level .
six out of 10 companies are planning to keep payrolls unchanged and only 8 percent seek to hire new staff . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops export league table these are dark days for the german economy but rays of light continue to break the gloom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.10.2003 romanian vote a step on path to brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many romanians were reluctant to cast ballots in what was seen as a vote of confidence in the government a romanian referendum aimed at preparing the country 's constitution for european union membership reached the needed voter turnout level sunday , but results are n't expected till later this week . romania 's electoral committee confirmed on monday that some 54 percent of the electorate cast ballots after the referendum was extended an extra day in an effort to attract greater participation . in the referendum , the people of romania were asked to vote on amendments to the constitution which would help bring the country in line with the laws of the european union .
amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .
priests even undertook get-out-the-vote initiatives . falling short of eu entry requirements many among the 16 million voters were expected to abstain in protest against the country 's widespread poverty and corruption , still prevalent 14 years after the collapse of communism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest 's " house of the people " the country is still haunted by the legacy of dictator nicolae ceausescu .
economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .
sorin ionita , the head of romanian academic society think tank , told reuters " polls show 75-80 percent of the public want eu accession .
but it does n't translate automatically as a voter turnout for the constitution . "
most of romania 's political parties supported the reforms , but the far-right greater romania party , the second-largest party in parliament , urged voters to abstain .
the opposition has now lodged a formal complaint to the federal election office , claiming breaches of voting procedures .
romanian media reported that measures to lure voters included mobile ballot boxes , offers of free food and medical check-ups , free theatre tickets and fire wood , while one provincial mayor allegedly told his villagers they would only get their pensions if they voted .
most analysts expect an overall vote in favor of the referendum , but reliable results wo n't be released until tuesday evening at the soonest . cleaning up the government 's image as part if a campaign to improve the government 's image , prime minister adrian nastase accepted the resignation of three of his top ministers on monday . european integration minister hildegard puwak , health minister mircea beuran and government co-ordination minister serban mihailescu have been accused by the media of embroilment in various forms of corruption .
the prime minister told reporters that " they resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters . " observers say the close result of referendum showed the government that people had insufficient faith in their leaders .
traian basescu from the opposition center-left party , pd , told reuters that the departure of the ministers was " a desperate attempt to rescue the party 's image after it forged the referendum .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .
" people find it hard to get a job when they ’ re 50 .
who wants them on the labor market until they ’ re 67 ? ” pensioner 's set to take action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grey panthers will march again , if need be .
the pension reform plans are also putting schröder on a collision course with the national pensioners ’ association , the vdk .
the association ’ s chief walter hirrlinger warned that the government would feel the anger of the country ’ s 20 million pensioners , announcing large-scale protest actions .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .

amid fears that turnout would fall below the 50 percent required to make the vote count , the romanian government launched a last-ditch campaign to encourage participation . after the governing psd party held an emergency video conference with local leaders to discuss their course of action , supporters and activists were sent door to door in a hard-sell to get people to cast their ballots .

economic mismanagement and oppression of ethnic minorities remain serious problems .
with monthly wages in what 's still one of europe 's poorest nations averaging less than € 150 as well as a shaky human rights record , romania still has a lot to do before it gets on track for eu membership . the reforms to the current constitution , first introduced back in 1991 , are considered crucial to romania 's chances of joining the european union , which is currently slated for 2007 .
they include guaranteeing the right to private property , demilitarizing the police , creating an independent judicial system and creating laws facilitating foreign investment .
ethnic minorities would also be guaranteed language rights when dealing with the government , and the disabled would be better protected . the reforms would also permit the military to come under nato command when romania becomes a member in 2004 . voters punish their leaders speaking in a national radio broadcast , romanian prime minister adrian nastase of the ruling former communists emphasized that , " this vote alone will not make our country rich ... but without it everything we have accomplished will be lost . " but observers say that many voters see the referendum as a vote of confidence in the government and say the low turnout reflects the failure of the country 's various cabinets during the post-communist years to improve standard of living and introduce effective reforms .
" if i voted , it would be a vote of confidence for corruption , lies , crony capitalism and nepotism , " engineer adrian trofin , who did not vote , told the associated press news agency . although most romanians are in favor of joining the eu , many are angry about the government 's endemic corruption and inability to maintain a viable economy .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .
nobody regrets this more than i do , but the country ’ s economic and demographic realities leave us with no other alternative but to freeze pensions at their current level , ” schröder said in a statement .
“ there ’ s agreement in the government that we have to do everything not to increase non-wage labor costs .
otherwise we ’ d send out a devastating signal to employers and investors . ” one of the most controversial and widely discussed issues of the proposed pension reforms , raising the official retirement age by two years , was largely dodged at sunday ’ s summit .
but schröder indicated that such a proposal was still on the table and would be debated in due time . internal unrest schröder faces internal unrest over the proposed scheme .
social democrat left-wingers view the proposed measures as a betrayal of their party ’ s long-standing social principles , saying that more and more citizens have stopped considering the spd to be an advocate of ordinary people ’ s interests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel .
unsurprisingly , the chancellor is also under fire from the opposition conservatives , including christian democratic unions chief angela merkel .
" the bottom line is that next year pensioners will have less in their pockets .
talking about a mere freeze is only a half-truth , " merkel said . " let ’ s not forget that pensioners will now also have to pay full nursing insurance premiums .
this will be hard for those who already have to turn over every penny before spending it . "
she also voiced her doubts whether the government ’ s proposed " patchwork policy " would help in the long run . still , proponents see the move as a further example of the readiness of the german government to make difficult cuts to the social system in order to spur slumping economic growth , even if the moves are unpopular with voters . trade unions blame government the german trade unions umbrella organization , dgb , has also criticized the government for what it sees as the punishment of pensioners for three years of failed economic policies and the resulting sluggish growth . “ in a situation like ours , it seems absurd to seriously consider raising the official retirement age by another two years , " said ursula engelen-kaefer , the confederation ’ s deputy chief ´ .

gerhard schröder barely had time to catch his breath from the reform vote on friday before his plans for a proposed pension scheme two days later set the chancellor at odds with many strong opposers . following a heated debate in parliament last week on the berlin government ’ s plans to cut unemployment benefits , german chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday announced more harsh measures concerning the country ’ s statutory pension system in a bid to decrease non-wage labor costs and support economic recovery after three years of near-recession . it ’ s a well known and disturbing fact that germany currently suffers from a steadily ageing population and the longest period of economic stagnation in its post-world war ii history .
this has put an enormous strain on the country ’ s generous statutory pension system , to the point that , without any reforms , experts say the system would run up a deficit of at least 8 billion euros in 2004 . the berlin coalition government of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens want to plug this hole by putting a freeze on pensions next year .
it also wants pensioners to carry the full cost of nursing insurance themselves . plugging long standing holes critics of the scheme , who debated the issue during a summit meeting of cabinet ministers and parliamentarians recently , accuse the government of continually reaching into poor people ’ s pockets , making them pay for budget holes that should have been plugged long ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the growing concern and opposition , spd and greens leaders also agreed a third step at their meeting on sunday .
pensions will in future be paid out at the end of each month and not at the beginning , as is common practice at present .
in effect , this will leave elderly people with a month ’ s pension less .
schröder said on sunday that these harsh measures were indispensable in the fight to keep pension contributions stable at 19.5 percent of gross earnings . no other alternative “ in 2004 we can not afford to pay out higher pensions .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party . a smashing victory for the anti-foreigner , isolationist swiss people ’ s party -lrb- svp -rrb- in sunday ’ s general elections threatens to shake up the " magic formula " which has served as the foundation of switzerland ’ s unique four party , coalition-style government for 44 years .
for the first time in decades the vote for a new parliament resulted in a political upset , turning a hitherto minor player into the strongest party in recent swiss history .
according to the swiss news agency sda on monday , the right-wing people ’ s party , which had campaigned hard on issues of immigration , asylum and security , took the biggest chunk of the vote with 27.7 percent and 55 seats in the 200-member parliament .
that marks an increase of over five percent and 11 seats compared to the last parliamentary election in 1999 .
the party headed by billionaire zurich industrialist christoph blocher is now clearly switzerland ’ s strongest party , and that has many people worrying that the pristine alpine state is leaning far right of center .
but the svp wasn ’ t the only winner in sunday ’ s election .
the social democrats -lrb- sp -rrb- gained two more seats for a total of 53 representatives in parliament , and the greens upped their seats to 13 representatives and became the largest party outside the four-party government coalition .
the wins for the social democrats and greens clearly came at a loss for the center-right business-minded radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , which lost seven seats , and the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp -rrb- , which lost eight seats - an all-time low for both mainstream parties and a shock to the some 4.7 million voters who had expected to see the election reinstate the traditionally strong parties .
mixing up the magic formula a day after the election , attention has now switched to whether or not the traditional four party government based on an equal division of cabinet seats among the sp , the fdp and the cvp will hold up on december 10 , when parliament must reelect the ministers that comprise the swiss federal council .
up to now the main parties have each held two ministries and the previously smaller svp made do with just one .
called the " magic formula , " this brand of coalition government has served as the backbone of swiss politics since 1959 .
but now the status quo looks like it may be overturned .
on monday svp leader blocher called for a second cabinet seat for his party to better reflect the changed make-up of parliament .
svp politicians have also made it clear that if the other coalition parties refuse , it will pull out of the government and create its own opposition - an unprecedented move in switzerland , where governmental decision making is based on consensus among all the parties .
most observers , however , believe the system of consensus will survive even with some shuffling among the parties .
" the governmental system is anchored in the constitution .
the collegial system won ’ t change , although its exact composition might , " political scientist hanspeter kriesi of zurich university told afp news agency .
christiane brunner , president of the social democrats , said it was simply a question of " reviewing the allocation of the five seats between the conservative parties , " while the sp - the second largest party after elections - retained its two posts .
a new mix-up of the magic formula would most likely result in the christian democrat party - the smallest party - having to forfeit a cabinet post , a move the party ’ s president philipp stahelin understandably resists .
no immediate change despite the clear victory for the svp in parliament , some analysts say the party may not gain a second cabinet position in december .
" i don ’ t think the outcome of this election will lead to a dramatic overhaul of the magic formula , " political analysts hans hirter told swiss radio international on sunday .
" but maybe in two or three years time , when one of the christian democrat ministers resigns , we will see the true importance of the election for the people ’ s party ’ s bid for a second government seat . "
in addition , analysts say greater inclusion of the svp in the federal council could actually defuse the party ’ s more extremist positions .
in order to get elected to the government , blocher will have to play the collegial game , otherwise he will not get very far , said kriesi .
on the other hand , focusing on consensus will go against his grain as a party leader , because it will force him to tone down the svp ’ s right-wing tendencies , kriesi explained , pointing to neighboring austria where jörg haider ’ s populist freedom party entered government and was required to soften some of its strident tone .
others who worry that the svp ’ s wins in sunday ’ s election could lead to right-leaning parliamentary rulings on immigration and even more isolationist policies seek solace in the fact that the alpine republic has a strong tradition of direct democracy , whereby power rests not with parliament but with the people .
a referendum , for instance , can be called on any political issue as long as campaigners manage to collect 100,000 signatures .

thousands of parents and teens took part in the ' talking teenagers ' survey making it one of the biggest ever snapshots of teens and parents attitudes .
when asked what the worst thing about their parents was : 41 % of teens said ' their moods ' , and 28 % ' their dress sense ' , but despite that they still would n't be without them .
dress sense is important more than 50 % said the best thing about parents was ' the way they show their love for me ' closely followed by ' the money they give me ' although they also appreciated their parents sense of humour !
but while the relationship between many parents and teens was pretty good there were still areas both sides worried about .
more than half of the teens felt they got a bad press and that being stereotyped was one of the hardest things about being a teenager .
as for being appreciated , only 13 % felt that society valued them .
parents were more worried about exams and schoolwork than teens and both expressed concerns about peer pressure and talking about sex and relationships .
dr john coleman says that over 30,000 teenagers and 12,000 parents responded making it one of the biggest ever surveys into family life .
over half the results were analysed but there were too many to look at them all .

anne owers , the chief inspector of prisons , said she would demand access to detention facilities without giving advance warning to the home office .
ms owers said the prisons inspectorate was establishing a special team to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers being detained .
the move comes after the watchdog criticised a number of asylum removal centres , including the policy of detaining children .
recent powers the chief inspector of prisons was given powers to enter immigration detention centres in 1999 .
ms owers : wants time limits on child detention ms owers said : " we will turn up without warning and i shall use these powers in relation to immigration removal centres .
" this is an important power because an announced inspection gives people the chance to prepare .
it is also important to know what is happening when they are not expecting you to turn up . "
ms owers said the first inspections of removal centres , known as detention centres until this year , had taken a long time to prepare and complete because she wanted to ensure that the views of asylum seekers being held were properly taken into account .
this confidential surveying of asylum seekers , often in their own languages , had caused " anxiety " within the home office , she said .
but she called on ministers to accept it as a valuable part of improving conditions - just as the prisons service used confidential surveys .
reports criticise centres asylum seekers can be held indefinitely in removal centres without being convicted of any crime .
the government says they are an essential part of the immigration system to remove failed applicants who refuse to leave .
yarl 's wood : recently reopened the chief inspector 's first reports on immigration removal centres have produced a mixed but generally critical picture , especially over the treatment of children .
ms owers has criticised strip searches of asylum seekers following visits at haslar removal centre , hampshire , concluding the institution was " unsafe " .
in the first inspection of harmondsworth removal centre , near heathrow airport , ms owers ' team found increasing levels of disorder .
a number of immigration removal centres have been hit by protests including sporadic hunger strikes and violent clashes .
yarl 's wood removal centre recently reopened after burning down amid rioting in 2002 .
dungavel removal centre in scotland has become a major political issue with a growing campaign against the detention of families at the institution .
' children compromised ' speaking to the association of visitors to immigration detainees , ms owers reiterated her concerns at the holding of children in detention centres .
" the development of a child is bound to be affected no matter how long the detention , " she said .
" it compromises the needs and welfare of children and the longer detention continues the more compromised these become .
" even with the good facilities at dungavel -lsb- removal centre in scotland -rsb- their welfare is compromised after two weeks . "
ms owers said her surveys and focus groups of those in removal centres tended to support the findings of her inspection teams , despite official suggestions the findings were not reliable .
" one of the perceptions of detainees is that they do n't feel safe , " she said .
" it 's not always because of the way the centre was being run , rather there was a sense of insecurity because they did not know what was going to happen to them and there was no one who could tell them what was going to happen . "

ms owers said the prisons inspectorate was establishing a special team to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers being detained .
the move comes after the watchdog criticised a number of asylum removal centres , including the policy of detaining children .
recent powers the chief inspector of prisons was given powers to enter immigration detention centres in 1999 .
ms owers : wants time limits on child detention ms owers said : " we will turn up without warning and i shall use these powers in relation to immigration removal centres .
" this is an important power because an announced inspection gives people the chance to prepare .
it is also important to know what is happening when they are not expecting you to turn up . "
ms owers said the first inspections of removal centres , known as detention centres until this year , had taken a long time to prepare and complete because she wanted to ensure that the views of asylum seekers being held were properly taken into account .
this confidential surveying of asylum seekers , often in their own languages , had caused " anxiety " within the home office , she said .
but she called on ministers to accept it as a valuable part of improving conditions - just as the prisons service used confidential surveys .
reports criticise centres asylum seekers can be held indefinitely in removal centres without being convicted of any crime .
the government says they are an essential part of the immigration system to remove failed applicants who refuse to leave .
yarl 's wood : recently reopened the chief inspector 's first reports on immigration removal centres have produced a mixed but generally critical picture , especially over the treatment of children .
ms owers has criticised strip searches of asylum seekers following visits at haslar removal centre , hampshire , concluding the institution was " unsafe " .
in the first inspection of harmondsworth removal centre , near heathrow airport , ms owers ' team found increasing levels of disorder .
a number of immigration removal centres have been hit by protests including sporadic hunger strikes and violent clashes .
yarl 's wood removal centre recently reopened after burning down amid rioting in 2002 .
dungavel removal centre in scotland has become a major political issue with a growing campaign against the detention of families at the institution .
' children compromised ' speaking to the association of visitors to immigration detainees , ms owers reiterated her concerns at the holding of children in detention centres .
" the development of a child is bound to be affected no matter how long the detention , " she said .
" it compromises the needs and welfare of children and the longer detention continues the more compromised these become .
" even with the good facilities at dungavel -lsb- removal centre in scotland -rsb- their welfare is compromised after two weeks . "
ms owers said her surveys and focus groups of those in removal centres tended to support the findings of her inspection teams , despite official suggestions the findings were not reliable .
" one of the perceptions of detainees is that they do n't feel safe , " she said .
" it 's not always because of the way the centre was being run , rather there was a sense of insecurity because they did not know what was going to happen to them and there was no one who could tell them what was going to happen . "

anne owers , the chief inspector of prisons , said she would demand access to detention facilities without giving advance warning to the home office .
ms owers said the prisons inspectorate was establishing a special team to monitor the treatment of asylum seekers being detained .
the move comes after the watchdog criticised a number of asylum removal centres , including the policy of detaining children .
recent powers the chief inspector of prisons was given powers to enter immigration detention centres in 1999 .
ms owers said : " we will turn up without warning and i shall use these powers in relation to immigration removal centres .
" this is an important power because an announced inspection gives people the chance to prepare .
it is also important to know what is happening when they are not expecting you to turn up . "
ms owers said the first inspections of removal centres , known as detention centres until this year , had taken a long time to prepare and complete because she wanted to ensure that the views of asylum seekers being held were properly taken into account .
this confidential surveying of asylum seekers , often in their own languages , had caused " anxiety " within the home office , she said .
but she called on ministers to accept it as a valuable part of improving conditions - just as the prisons service used confidential surveys .
reports criticise centres asylum seekers can be held indefinitely in removal centres without being convicted of any crime .
the government says they are an essential part of the immigration system to remove failed applicants who refuse to leave .
the chief inspector 's first reports on immigration removal centres have produced a mixed but generally critical picture , especially over the treatment of children .
ms owers has criticised strip searches of asylum seekers following visits at haslar removal centre , hampshire , concluding the institution was " unsafe " .
in the first inspection of harmondsworth removal centre , near heathrow airport , ms owers ' team found increasing levels of disorder .
a number of immigration removal centres have been hit by protests including sporadic hunger strikes and violent clashes .
yarl 's wood removal centre recently reopened after burning down amid rioting in 2002 .
dungavel removal centre in scotland has become a major political issue with a growing campaign against the detention of families at the institution .
' children compromised ' speaking to the association of visitors to immigration detainees , ms owers reiterated her concerns at the holding of children in detention centres .
" the development of a child is bound to be affected no matter how long the detention , " she said .
" it compromises the needs and welfare of children and the longer detention continues the more compromised these become .
" even with the good facilities at dungavel -lsb- removal centre in scotland -rsb- their welfare is compromised after two weeks . "
ms owers said her surveys and focus groups of those in removal centres tended to support the findings of her inspection teams , despite official suggestions the findings were not reliable .
" one of the perceptions of detainees is that they do n't feel safe , " she said .
" it 's not always because of the way the centre was being run , rather there was a sense of insecurity because they did not know what was going to happen to them and there was no one who could tell them what was going to happen . "

it found that energy firms ' go slow ' when refunds are due to customers who have overpaid on their monthly direct debt or when a final bill shows them to have a credit .
in the last year , the consumer group has intervened in 6,000 cases ; customers were owed on average £ 350 .
as a result , the group has accused energy firms of " double standards " , saying they are quick to chase people who owe money but delay refunds .
long wait if the boot was on the other foot , energy consumers would soon be receiving letters threatening disconnection or court action ann robinson , energywatch in some cases , energy firms have owed customers money for years .
according to enerywatch , one customer , mr t from cambridge , spent two years chasing his energy firm for an accurate statement of account , which eventually revealed that it owed him £ 800 .
he was still waiting for a refund when he asked energywatch to intervene .
energywatch is concerned that the cases they get to see are only the tip of the iceberg .
" this is the worst kind of double standards .
if the boot was on the other foot , energy consumers would soon be receiving letters threatening disconnection or court action , " energywatch chair , ann robinson , said .
your comments every year , i overpay on my gas - i have gas heating and water , but i use so much electricity that i do n't need the heating very much .
every year i call my gas provider at the start of the summer and point out that they owe me £ 100 or so and that since the difference is only going to get bigger over the summer , they may as well give me the refund now .
every year , they pay me back the money promptly and without fuss .
i 'd prefer if the bills were more accurate to start with , but i certainly have no complaint about the refund procedure .
and it 's always nice to get a little lump sum , even if it is a refund of money you did n't need to pay out in the first place .
richard cohen , uk i have only just become a customer with powergen who supply my gas and electricity to a brand new flat , in fact the first flat i have ever owned .
no-one was living previously at my address , and so i was surprised when i was asked to sign up for direct debit , to be told that due to the high usage of gas and electricity previously recorded from my flat , i should sign up for their recommended debit amount of £ 30 for each account .
when i said that i did n't want to do this and wanted to pay only £ 10 a month for each account and make up the difference , i was told that this was not possible as £ 30 was the minimum .
eventually i managed to get them to agree to debit only £ 10 only to find that i was sent letters a couple of days later , thanking me for agreeing to debit £ 30 .
i then had to phone again , and try to wrangle my debit amount down to £ 10 .
this is terrible it seems that the energy companies can do what they like when they like .
something has to be done about this .
paul , uk quite the reverse .
i use british gas for both electricity and gas and they have automatically repaid me what i overpaid as at the annual anniversary and they reduced the monthly amount .
i pay by monthly d / d and i always send an updated reading whenever i receive an estimated reading .
roger jones , england i do not give them the chance of overcharging , when the estimate comes in i read the meter and send them the readings , and wait for the revised bill .
i do notice that if you are on direct debit they can take what they want and it is always to their benefit .
this why i would never use direct debit for utility payments .
h.mactaggart , uk i have to say that my only experience with this scenario was extremely customer service focussed .
i rang in to get a refund -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- after a year of direct debits and also to reduce my monthly payment to avoid going back into the black in the future .
the company , powergen , had the money back into my account within 10 days and the direct debit reduced for the following month .
it will be interesting to see if i 'm in a majority or minority .
tom , uk i asked my electricity supplier to send a direct debit to pay the full amount each quarter when due .
i received a partially completed debit form for a fixed monthly payment at 10 % above the value of my normal use .
when i rang their customer services , i was told that they may consider sending me a cheque back once it reached approximately £ 75 .
i was astounded that the company expected me to pay them more than was due , earn the interest for themselves and then they might just decide to let me have my own money back , without the interest .
i also asked why i was not entitled to an early settlement discount for paying the complete bill when due , as i do with all my other utility suppliers .
clive wilkins , uk i had a consolidated gas & electric account with amerada presented as a single consolidated statement .
when i moved house the net balance was over £ 60 in credit .
i owed a small amount in gas , they owed me a lot more for overpayment of electric .
despite many phone calls to receive the net overpayment , they still referred my case to a debt collection agency on the basis that the gas was in debit .
i eventually received the refund owed , but the experience left a bad taste .
andrew , uk i was with british gas and i found that my direct debit increased every winter and did n't fall in the summer even though i was well in credit .
after two years of trying to get a cheque out of them i asked what i had to do to get the cheque .
my friendly advice from one of their telephone people was to close the direct debit and i would get the cheque almost by return .
this advice was correct , i however went one step further and changed supplier and the problem was solved , i pay just about what i use .
pauline fearn , uk i work for a utility company , and generally find that you only get to here about the bad things that happen and the mistakes made .
with millions of customers these things will occur .
unfortunately the public rarely get to hear about the good things energy company 's do and their partnerships with charities etc .

every year i call my gas provider at the start of the summer and point out that they owe me £ 100 or so and that since the difference is only going to get bigger over the summer , they may as well give me the refund now .
every year , they pay me back the money promptly and without fuss .
i 'd prefer if the bills were more accurate to start with , but i certainly have no complaint about the refund procedure .
and it 's always nice to get a little lump sum , even if it is a refund of money you did n't need to pay out in the first place .
richard cohen , uk i have only just become a customer with powergen who supply my gas and electricity to a brand new flat , in fact the first flat i have ever owned .
no-one was living previously at my address , and so i was surprised when i was asked to sign up for direct debit , to be told that due to the high usage of gas and electricity previously recorded from my flat , i should sign up for their recommended debit amount of £ 30 for each account .
when i said that i did n't want to do this and wanted to pay only £ 10 a month for each account and make up the difference , i was told that this was not possible as £ 30 was the minimum .
eventually i managed to get them to agree to debit only £ 10 only to find that i was sent letters a couple of days later , thanking me for agreeing to debit £ 30 .
i then had to phone again , and try to wrangle my debit amount down to £ 10 .
this is terrible it seems that the energy companies can do what they like when they like .
something has to be done about this .
paul , uk quite the reverse .
i use british gas for both electricity and gas and they have automatically repaid me what i overpaid as at the annual anniversary and they reduced the monthly amount .
i pay by monthly d / d and i always send an updated reading whenever i receive an estimated reading .
roger jones , england i do not give them the chance of overcharging , when the estimate comes in i read the meter and send them the readings , and wait for the revised bill .
i do notice that if you are on direct debit they can take what they want and it is always to their benefit .
this why i would never use direct debit for utility payments .
h.mactaggart , uk i have to say that my only experience with this scenario was extremely customer service focussed .
i rang in to get a refund -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- after a year of direct debits and also to reduce my monthly payment to avoid going back into the black in the future .
the company , powergen , had the money back into my account within 10 days and the direct debit reduced for the following month .
it will be interesting to see if i 'm in a majority or minority .
tom , uk i asked my electricity supplier to send a direct debit to pay the full amount each quarter when due .
i received a partially completed debit form for a fixed monthly payment at 10 % above the value of my normal use .
when i rang their customer services , i was told that they may consider sending me a cheque back once it reached approximately £ 75 .
i was astounded that the company expected me to pay them more than was due , earn the interest for themselves and then they might just decide to let me have my own money back , without the interest .
i also asked why i was not entitled to an early settlement discount for paying the complete bill when due , as i do with all my other utility suppliers .
clive wilkins , uk i had a consolidated gas & electric account with amerada presented as a single consolidated statement .
when i moved house the net balance was over £ 60 in credit .
i owed a small amount in gas , they owed me a lot more for overpayment of electric .
despite many phone calls to receive the net overpayment , they still referred my case to a debt collection agency on the basis that the gas was in debit .

after two years of trying to get a cheque out of them i asked what i had to do to get the cheque .
my friendly advice from one of their telephone people was to close the direct debit and i would get the cheque almost by return .
this advice was correct , i however went one step further and changed supplier and the problem was solved , i pay just about what i use .

sony confirmed it would announce a sweeping restructuring next week , including job cuts and domestic television plant closures , but would not comment on the scale of the job losses .
" job cuts and plant closures definitely will be included , but details , like the time frame for the plant closures , have not been finalised , " one company source told reuters .
sony shocked investors in april with a quarterly loss of almost $ 1bn .
the firm is struggling to cope with weak demand for its consumer products , and its electronics division has been plagued by high costs and mounting inventories .
changing demands sony once dominated the television industry but failed to spot the shift in demand towards flat-screen tvs with liquid crystal display -lrb- lcd -rrb- .
the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper reported that sony would announce a joint venture with south korea 's samsung to make lcd screens for televisions .
as well as struggling to keep up with changing fashions , sony has also been badly hit by the economic downturn in the us , its key export market .
sony will announce its new business strategy and restructuring on 28 october .
it has a global workforce of 160,000 at present .

their worries will be aired on bbc one 's current affairs programme real story .
some families have criticised the ministry of defence for its handling of the investigation , but the ministry said it could not release information about the deaths " prematurely " .
among those interviewed are reg keys , whose son thomas 20 , was one of six military policemen gunned down in a police station .
mr keys , of llanuwchllyn , near bala , north wales , said : " they let those six lads drive into that town lightly armed , with inadequate communications straight into the valley of death . " " " incompetence is the word to sum it up .
absolute incompetence . "
" reg keys , father of a victim an mod spokeswoman said : " the premature release of any information may prejudice the outcome of any future proceedings that may result from the royal military police 's investigation .
" the rmp -lrb- royal military police -rrb- fully understand the families ' desire for an early conclusion but it is vital to ensure that the investigation is as thorough as possible , " she added .
families of the soldiers who died claim the investigation could last up to three years .
the men were killed as a crowd surrounded a police station at al majar al-kabir , near basra , in june , seven weeks after the war ended .
" incompetence is the word to sum it up .
absolute incompetence , " said mr keys .
he added : " there was thomas and his five brave colleagues standing side by side trying to hold off a frenzied iraqi mob armed with high velocity weapons , baying for their blood .
" but we believe these six lads held the crowd off for about 40 minutes and this overwhelming horde of iraqis have just rushed into this station and mowed them down .
' horrific ' " it is horrific to think my 20-year-old son has witnessed this and someone has stood over his body and finished my dear , darling son off .
" for parents to come to terms with this after all the trouble and hard work you put in to bring up your son , you hand him over to the army , yes you accept it can be a hazardous occupation .
" but you hand your son over hoping they are going to be responsible , but i feel on this day the army were irresponsible and i ca n't forgive them for that . "
tony fisher 's 41-year-old brother sergeant simon hamilton-jewell from chessington , surrey , died in the attack .
mr fisher was asked how confident he was that the army report would be truthful .
" on a scale of one to ten , 0.5 because we , in three and a half months , have received virtually no information , " he said .
he added : " what it will be is a cover-up .
because they do n't like to admit mistakes . "
the soldiers were members of the 156 provo company attached to 16 air assault brigade , based in colchester , essex .
they were attempting to defend the police station after a confrontation in which locals complained about heavy-handed weapons searches conducted previously by troops and the use of plastic bullets .
it was reported that two days before they were attacked there was trouble in the region over weapons searches conducted by british paratroopers .
the other soldiers who died were corporal paul long , 24 , from colchester , corporal simon miller , 21 , from washington , tyne & wear , corporal russell aston , 30 , from swadlincote , derbyshire and lance-corporal benjamin hyde , 23 , from northallerton , yorkshire .

their worries will be aired on bbc one 's current affairs programme real story .
some families have criticised the ministry of defence for its handling of the investigation , but the ministry said it could not release information about the deaths " prematurely " .
among those interviewed are reg keys , whose son thomas 20 , was one of six military policemen gunned down in a police station .
mr keys , of llanuwchllyn , near bala , north wales , said : " they let those six lads drive into that town lightly armed , with inadequate communications straight into the valley of death . "
" incompetence is the word to sum it up .
absolute incompetence . "
reg keys , father of a victim an mod spokeswoman said : " the premature release of any information may prejudice the outcome of any future proceedings that may result from the royal military police 's investigation .
" the rmp -lrb- royal military police -rrb- fully understand the families ' desire for an early conclusion but it is vital to ensure that the investigation is as thorough as possible , " she added .
families of the soldiers who died claim the investigation could last up to three years .
the men were killed as a crowd surrounded a police station at al majar al-kabir , near basra , in june , seven weeks after the war ended .
the mod says information can not be released ' prematurely ' " incompetence is the word to sum it up .
absolute incompetence , " said mr keys .
he added : " there was thomas and his five brave colleagues standing side by side trying to hold off a frenzied iraqi mob armed with high velocity weapons , baying for their blood .
" but we believe these six lads held the crowd off for about 40 minutes and this overwhelming horde of iraqis have just rushed into this station and mowed them down .
' horrific ' " it is horrific to think my 20-year-old son has witnessed this and someone has stood over his body and finished my dear , darling son off .
" for parents to come to terms with this after all the trouble and hard work you put in to bring up your son , you hand him over to the army , yes you accept it can be a hazardous occupation .
" but you hand your son over hoping they are going to be responsible , but i feel on this day the army were irresponsible and i ca n't forgive them for that . "
tony fisher 's 41-year-old brother sergeant simon hamilton-jewell from chessington , surrey , died in the attack .
mr fisher was asked how confident he was that the army report would be truthful .
" on a scale of one to ten , 0.5 because we , in three and a half months , have received virtually no information , " he said .
he added : " what it will be is a cover-up .
because they do n't like to admit mistakes . "
the soldiers were members of the 156 provo company attached to 16 air assault brigade , based in colchester , essex .
they were attempting to defend the police station after a confrontation in which locals complained about heavy-handed weapons searches conducted previously by troops and the use of plastic bullets .
it was reported that two days before they were attacked there was trouble in the region over weapons searches conducted by british paratroopers .

arriva , which will take over on 7 december , will receive subsidies totalling £ 1.63bn over the 15 years it holds the contract .
the company , which will operate as arriva trains wales / trenau arriva cymru ltd , has also promised safer and more punctual performance , a more " user-friendly " timetable , and greater integration of trains and buses .
the company , which will operate as arriva trains wales / trenau arriva cymru ltd , will get subsidies of more than £ 100m for each year after signing a deal with the strategic rail authority on monday .
it means for the first time wales will have a single rail service run by one management .
arriva chief executive bob davies said : " we have established a team based in cardiff who are working closely with the existing operator to ensure a smooth transition in december .
" over the next couple of months there will be an extensive consultation process regarding our plans to improve the rail service in wales and the border counties .
" this process will involve the welsh assembly government , the rail passengers council and committees , and other stakeholders .
' key commitments ' " our focus will be to ensure we deliver a safe railway with improved performance , reliability and punctuality for existing and new customers . "
arriva will hold the franchise until 2019 .
it will operate all stations in wales , and those largely served by the new franchise in the border counties , including chester , shrewsbury and hereford .
arriva said its " key commitments " included : maintaining current service levels ; developing a " simplified , user-friendly timetable , as well as better performance and connections , planned for december 2005 for the valley lines and inter-urban services " ; introducing seven new trains for " greater operational flexibility and resilience , to replace current , less suitable stock " ; a better compensation scheme for passengers , including full refunds for anyone delayed by more than 60 minutes ; thirty new integrated train-bus ticket schemes by november 2005 , to create a fully integrated railway system .
among the areas to benefit will be bangor , llandudno , aberystwyth , shrewsbury , chester and hereford ; improved bilingual access , including a welsh language customer service phone line , passenger timetables and information , full bi-lingual signage and recorded station announcements at stations where there are existing suitable public address systems by may 2004 ; introduction of a new , " customer-focused station adopter " scheme ; £ 400,000 on improving station car parks at cardiff central , chester , hereford , newport and shrewsbury ; abolition of the £ 1 reservation charge for bicycles on trains .
richard bowker , chairman of the strategic rail authority , said there would be a " step change " in train services for wales .
" this has all been achieved through partnership between the welsh assembly government and the sra , and arriva trains will now concentrate on what matters most to passengers - improved performance , reliability and punctuality , " said mr bowker .
welsh economic development and transport minister andrew davies said : " i am looking forward to working with arriva to improve the existing service and to develop new passenger services on the vale of glamorgan and ebbw valley lines . "

arriva , which will take over on 7 december , will receive subsidies totalling £ 1.63bn over the 15 years it holds the contract .
the company , which will operate as arriva trains wales / trenau arriva cymru ltd , has also promised safer and more punctual performance , a more " user-friendly " timetable , and greater integration of trains and buses .
the company , which will operate as arriva trains wales / trenau arriva cymru ltd , will get subsidies of more than £ 100m for each year after signing a deal with the strategic rail authority on monday .
it means for the first time wales will have a single rail service run by one management .
arriva chief executive bob davies said : " we have established a team based in cardiff who are working closely with the existing operator to ensure a smooth transition in december .
" over the next couple of months there will be an extensive consultation process regarding our plans to improve the rail service in wales and the border counties .
" this process will involve the welsh assembly government , the rail passengers council and committees , and other stakeholders .
' key commitments ' " our focus will be to ensure we deliver a safe railway with improved performance , reliability and punctuality for existing and new customers . "
arriva will hold the franchise until 2019 .
it will operate all stations in wales , and those largely served by the new franchise in the border counties , including chester , shrewsbury and hereford .
arriva said its " key commitments " included : maintaining current service levels ; developing a " simplified , user-friendly timetable , as well as better performance and connections , planned for december 2005 for the valley lines and inter-urban services " ; introducing seven new trains for " greater operational flexibility and resilience , to replace current , less suitable stock " ; a better compensation scheme for passengers , including full refunds for anyone delayed by more than 60 minutes ; thirty new integrated train-bus ticket schemes by november 2005 , to create a fully integrated railway system .
among the areas to benefit will be bangor , llandudno , aberystwyth , shrewsbury , chester and hereford ; improved bilingual access , including a welsh language customer service phone line , passenger timetables and information , full bi-lingual signage and recorded station announcements at stations where there are existing suitable public address systems by may 2004 ; introduction of a new , " customer-focused station adopter " scheme ; £ 400,000 on improving station car parks at cardiff central , chester , hereford , newport and shrewsbury ; abolition of the £ 1 reservation charge for bicycles on trains .
richard bowker , chairman of the strategic rail authority , said there would be a " step change " in train services for wales .
" this has all been achieved through partnership between the welsh assembly government and the sra , and arriva trains will now concentrate on what matters most to passengers - improved performance , reliability and punctuality , " said mr bowker .
welsh economic development and transport minister andrew davies said : " i am looking forward to working with arriva to improve the existing service and to develop new passenger services on the vale of glamorgan and ebbw valley lines . "

this week , we 're testing the scottish executive 's campaign to coax commuters out of their cars and onto buses and trains .
we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by brenda roddy i live in edinburgh and i work for falkirk council so i generally have a 60-mile round trip every day .
i try to take the train to work whenever i can but as we do n't have any pool vehicles at work , if i have any meetings lined up i take the car in .
this week i 've got a lot of travelling to do in the days and evenings so i 'll have to put a good bit of effort in .
life 's a dream on a train day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one not the average commute to work .
had to go to an all-day conference in dunfermline .
bought a gorgeous , tiny new car yesterday - very difficult to walk past on the way out the door , but good weather helped .
0800 left home - 30 minute walk to train station 0830 train to dunfermline , arrives 0915 0920 coach to conference 0935 arrive at venue 1630 coach to train station 1640 arrive at station 1715 train arrives at dunfermline 1755 train arrives edinburgh 1830 arrive home after 30 minute walk advantages i did n't have to contend with the long queues for the forth road bridge or work out where dunfermline or the conference venue actually was .
probably worked out good value for money with a return train journey costing £ 6 .
got to sleep all the way there and chatted with colleagues on the way home .
breakdown walking : 60 mins bus : 30 mins train : 80 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 6 disadvantages great timing and connections on the way there but had half an hour to wait for a train on the way home - feeling cold and tired .
conference was off the beaten track and afternoon sessions were n't of great relevance to my job .
if i 'd had the car , i would have nipped over to my work but had to stay put .
had to give up on going to evening class as work journeys took longer than if i 'd gone by car .
bus connections from home to class are very patchy and 20-minute journey takes 45 minutes on the bus .
at the end of the day i was also more refreshed as i could switch off but i ca n't pack as much into a day as i usually do .
also felt fitter from walking instead of driving .
day two a disaster .
plan was to walk to train station -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- , get train -lrb- 40 mins -rrb- and walk -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- to work .
had to use car in the end .
part of my job involves encouraging people to compost and i had to dig a massive hole in my garden .
the only way was to borrow a pickaxe and pinch bar from colleagues in falkirk .
tried all kinds of possibilities like sending the tools home with colleagues but it all boiled down to me sitting on an lrt bus with a pickaxe and pinch bar that i can barely lift .
i 'm 5ft 4in so i would have looked a right eejit trying to cart them around .
breakdown bus : 0 mins train : 0 mins car : 90 mins cost : ?
car journey took 45 minutes in both directions , about 30-mile journey each way .
the aa has a journey cost calculator on their website that put the journey at just over £ 2 .
what a load of rubbish !
petrol works out far dearer than that and god knows what wear and tear on the car is .
gave all sets of keys to neighbour -lrb- including the emergency one -rrb- .
temptation is too much - not allowed them back until saturday morning .
tried leaving hardly any petrol in it as deterrent .
day three plan for the day was to get train from edinburgh to work in falkirk , then train it over to glasgow to go rock-climbing in the evening .
usually do this by car as it 's the only way i can get back to edinburgh by bedtime .
knew i would n't get back to edinburgh until really late if i used public transport so arranged to stay with friends in glasgow .
0615 get up 0700 30 mins walk to train station -lrb- bus 80p but £ 1.60 per day adds up so prefer to walk for exercise -rrb- 0735 train to falkirk - on time , sleep all the way 0810 arrive in falkirk , 25 minute walk to work , halo shining ! 1652 bus from work to falkirk high station on time - hurray !
i 'm a good walker but it 's about two-and-a-half miles to that station with a big hill at the end .
costs £ 1.30 1720 train to glasgow arrives on time , sleep all the way 1800 underground to ibrox to go to climbing centre , costs 90p 1810 arrive ibrox , 10 minute walk to climbing centre 2130 cheat and accept lift to friends ' house because i 'm not wandering around ibrox in the dark to save the planet .
general had to get single ticket to glasgow , costing £ 8.60 .
ca n't get an open return .
when you look at the bus service from edinburgh to glasgow where you can get a day return for £ 5 , this train service does n't strike me as value for money .
whilst the train fares really mount up , i once tried getting the bus home one evening and it took more than two hours to go 30 miles .
the bus seemed to stop at every hole in the hedge .
checked out http : / / www.chooseanotherway.com.
this can flag up the main transport companies in your area of choice but does n't tell you which ones are relevant to you .
traveline was much more useful , telling you which company and bus number to get , times etc , but it does n't give you the prices so it 's difficult to make a direct comparison .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.80 tried the first direct bus website to get information on timetables and fares and it was pretty poor .
if you know the answers to your questions before you go on the website you should be able to use it .
if you 're not already quite familiar , you ca n't carry out any searches and it 's very , very frustrating .
gave up on that one .
journey from work in falkirk to ibrox was definitely quicker than i could have done by car and i got to sleep for a good bit of it .
no doubt that it worked out cheaper than the car too , considering petrol and wear and tear .
public transport involves more waiting about and much , much more planning - bringing a change of clothes into work after a long walk in or a drenching .
day four have to get into work for 0800 to prepare for meetings .
had to be pretty organised and bring today 's clothes to work with me yesterday on top of my sports gear .
you wind up carrying a lot of stuff about with you on public transport that you 'd generally put in the boot of the car .
most weeks i travel to glasgow one evening for shinty practice but not this week , thank goodness .
i 'd felt ridiculous carting my gear to work and through meetings .
0625 leave friends ' house in glasgow 0630 bus into city centre , 97p 0706 train to falkirk grahamston , sleep all the way 0740 arrive falkirk , 25 minute walk to work 0805 arrive at work sweaty and bedraggled 1600 leave work on foot , 25 minute walk to station .
wet 1625 train arrives , 35 minute journey to edinburgh .
slept and dried out 1700 train arrives in edinburgh , 25 minute walk home .
wet 1830 home - hurray !
gorgeous wee car outside front door .
hardly used and i 've had it a week ! 1830 five minute walk to get bus to evening class .
bus quite prompt , 30 minute journey .
2115 half hour bus journey back from evening class , home 2145 .
car looks absolutely beautiful and cosy and tiny and must be terribly energy efficient .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.85 general have to admit that today 's journeys would have all been longer by car , more expensive and i could n't have slept .
the bus journey to the night class meant that i could leave for it later as i did n't have to trawl about looking for a parking place .
now that i 've found out the bus connections , i 'll keep using the bus for that and for the other evening class on a tuesday .
again , no parking or traffic hassles .
day five last day .
today 's an awkward one as i 've got a long-standing medical appointment at 0910 here in edinburgh and i 'm meant to start work by 1000 at the latest in falkirk .
if i was using the car , i could get there by 1015 .
that 's not going to happen today but i 've warned by boss and he was fine .
on the positive side , i can go out for a beer with my colleague after work and get the train home .
breakdown walking : 45 mins bus : 40 mins train : 65 mins cost : £ 8.10 0850 leave house for medical appointment , 15 minute walk 0920 five minute wait for bus to train station , 10 minute journey 0945 caught glasgow train to go to falkirk high .
managed to get the one that stops at every hole in the hedge but had a 30 minute sleep on the way 1015 arrived falkirk , five minute walk to bus stop and had just missed my connection .
20 minute wait 1040 bus to work , three mile walk is too far 1110 arrived at work .
took 1hr 50mins where car would have taken 45 1700 25 minute walk from work to train station , so tempting to scrounge a lift but i 'd come this far so no 1725 train arrives promptly then does that " sitting about doing nothing " stunt that they do - twice - just to keep you from getting home on a friday afternoon 1810 back in edinburgh .
25 minute walk home .
gorgeous , neglected car still there looking at me .
get keys back in the morning .
hitting the pub later on foot so that 's me done .
hurray !
verdict doing this for a week in october is n't that bad .
in the summer you can get quite manky on the way to and from work and external meetings .
i 've had to chuck clothes out .
it 'll be interesting to carry out the same survey in the colder months like february -lrb- not volunteering -rrb- .
it 's much harder not to slip into your wee temperature controlled car when it 's lashing outside and will do all day .
another big factor in the winter is the ice on paths .
in edinburgh , they do n't salt the footpaths so you ca n't walk up my street or leith walk without sweating blood trying to stay vertical .
you wind up having to walk on the roads and i 've taken the car because it 's safer than the edinburgh paths .
all in all it 's been very interesting .
i 'd like to take some of the lessons that i learned this week on , so i hope to aim to take public transport to work at least three days per week and possibly more if my employers can come up with some alternative to using my own car for site visits and meetings .
out of work i 'll definitely be taking the bus more .
i had to make the effort to find out about more of the buses in my area so i can actually get to evening classes quicker that way .
i also learned that it 's not impossible to get to places in glasgow without taking the car .
i believe there 's a vacancy for the patron saint of public transport although st christopher has got the main job covered - my application is in the post !

this week , we 're testing the scottish executive 's campaign to coax commuters out of their cars and onto buses and trains .
we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by brenda roddy i live in edinburgh and i work for falkirk council so i generally have a 60-mile round trip every day .
i try to take the train to work whenever i can but as we do n't have any pool vehicles at work , if i have any meetings lined up i take the car in .
this week i 've got a lot of travelling to do in the days and evenings so i 'll have to put a good bit of effort in .
life 's a dream on a train day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one not the average commute to work .
had to go to an all-day conference in dunfermline .
bought a gorgeous , tiny new car yesterday - very difficult to walk past on the way out the door , but good weather helped .
0800 left home - 30 minute walk to train station 0830 train to dunfermline , arrives 0915 0920 coach to conference 0935 arrive at venue 1630 coach to train station 1640 arrive at station 1715 train arrives at dunfermline 1755 train arrives edinburgh 1830 arrive home after 30 minute walk advantages i did n't have to contend with the long queues for the forth road bridge or work out where dunfermline or the conference venue actually was .
probably worked out good value for money with a return train journey costing £ 6 .
got to sleep all the way there and chatted with colleagues on the way home .
breakdown walking : 60 mins bus : 30 mins train : 80 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 6 disadvantages great timing and connections on the way there but had half an hour to wait for a train on the way home - feeling cold and tired .
conference was off the beaten track and afternoon sessions were n't of great relevance to my job .
if i 'd had the car , i would have nipped over to my work but had to stay put .
had to give up on going to evening class as work journeys took longer than if i 'd gone by car .
bus connections from home to class are very patchy and 20-minute journey takes 45 minutes on the bus .
at the end of the day i was also more refreshed as i could switch off but i ca n't pack as much into a day as i usually do .
also felt fitter from walking instead of driving .
day two a disaster .
plan was to walk to train station -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- , get train -lrb- 40 mins -rrb- and walk -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- to work .
had to use car in the end .
part of my job involves encouraging people to compost and i had to dig a massive hole in my garden .
the only way was to borrow a pickaxe and pinch bar from colleagues in falkirk .
tried all kinds of possibilities like sending the tools home with colleagues but it all boiled down to me sitting on an lrt bus with a pickaxe and pinch bar that i can barely lift .
i 'm 5ft 4in so i would have looked a right eejit trying to cart them around .
breakdown bus : 0 mins train : 0 mins car : 90 mins cost : ?
car journey took 45 minutes in both directions , about 30-mile journey each way .
the aa has a journey cost calculator on their website that put the journey at just over £ 2 .
what a load of rubbish !
petrol works out far dearer than that and god knows what wear and tear on the car is .
gave all sets of keys to neighbour -lrb- including the emergency one -rrb- .
temptation is too much - not allowed them back until saturday morning .
tried leaving hardly any petrol in it as deterrent .
day three plan for the day was to get train from edinburgh to work in falkirk , then train it over to glasgow to go rock-climbing in the evening .
usually do this by car as it 's the only way i can get back to edinburgh by bedtime .
knew i would n't get back to edinburgh until really late if i used public transport so arranged to stay with friends in glasgow .
0615 get up 0700 30 mins walk to train station -lrb- bus 80p but £ 1.60 per day adds up so prefer to walk for exercise -rrb- 0735 train to falkirk - on time , sleep all the way 0810 arrive in falkirk , 25 minute walk to work , halo shining ! 1652 bus from work to falkirk high station on time - hurray !
i 'm a good walker but it 's about two-and-a-half miles to that station with a big hill at the end .
costs £ 1.30 1720 train to glasgow arrives on time , sleep all the way 1800 underground to ibrox to go to climbing centre , costs 90p 1810 arrive ibrox , 10 minute walk to climbing centre 2130 cheat and accept lift to friends ' house because i 'm not wandering around ibrox in the dark to save the planet .
general had to get single ticket to glasgow , costing £ 8.60 .
ca n't get an open return .
when you look at the bus service from edinburgh to glasgow where you can get a day return for £ 5 , this train service does n't strike me as value for money .
whilst the train fares really mount up , i once tried getting the bus home one evening and it took more than two hours to go 30 miles .
the bus seemed to stop at every hole in the hedge .
checked out http : / / www.chooseanotherway.com.
this can flag up the main transport companies in your area of choice but does n't tell you which ones are relevant to you .
traveline was much more useful , telling you which company and bus number to get , times etc , but it does n't give you the prices so it 's difficult to make a direct comparison .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.80 tried the first direct bus website to get information on timetables and fares and it was pretty poor .
if you know the answers to your questions before you go on the website you should be able to use it .
if you 're not already quite familiar , you ca n't carry out any searches and it 's very , very frustrating .
gave up on that one .
journey from work in falkirk to ibrox was definitely quicker than i could have done by car and i got to sleep for a good bit of it .
no doubt that it worked out cheaper than the car too , considering petrol and wear and tear .
public transport involves more waiting about and much , much more planning - bringing a change of clothes into work after a long walk in or a drenching .
day four have to get into work for 0800 to prepare for meetings .
had to be pretty organised and bring today 's clothes to work with me yesterday on top of my sports gear .
you wind up carrying a lot of stuff about with you on public transport that you 'd generally put in the boot of the car .
most weeks i travel to glasgow one evening for shinty practice but not this week , thank goodness .
i 'd felt ridiculous carting my gear to work and through meetings .
0625 leave friends ' house in glasgow 0630 bus into city centre , 97p 0706 train to falkirk grahamston , sleep all the way 0740 arrive falkirk , 25 minute walk to work 0805 arrive at work sweaty and bedraggled 1600 leave work on foot , 25 minute walk to station .

this week , we 're testing the scottish executive 's campaign to coax commuters out of their cars and onto buses and trains .
we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by brenda roddy i live in edinburgh and i work for falkirk council so i generally have a 60-mile round trip every day .
i try to take the train to work whenever i can but as we do n't have any pool vehicles at work , if i have any meetings lined up i take the car in .
this week i 've got a lot of travelling to do in the days and evenings so i 'll have to put a good bit of effort in .
life 's a dream on a train day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one not the average commute to work .
had to go to an all-day conference in dunfermline .
bought a gorgeous , tiny new car yesterday - very difficult to walk past on the way out the door , but good weather helped .
0800 left home - 30 minute walk to train station 0830 train to dunfermline , arrives 0915 0920 coach to conference 0935 arrive at venue 1630 coach to train station 1640 arrive at station 1715 train arrives at dunfermline 1755 train arrives edinburgh 1830 arrive home after 30 minute walk advantages i did n't have to contend with the long queues for the forth road bridge or work out where dunfermline or the conference venue actually was .
probably worked out good value for money with a return train journey costing £ 6 .
got to sleep all the way there and chatted with colleagues on the way home .
breakdown walking : 60 mins bus : 30 mins train : 80 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 6 disadvantages great timing and connections on the way there but had half an hour to wait for a train on the way home - feeling cold and tired .
conference was off the beaten track and afternoon sessions were n't of great relevance to my job .
if i 'd had the car , i would have nipped over to my work but had to stay put .
had to give up on going to evening class as work journeys took longer than if i 'd gone by car .
bus connections from home to class are very patchy and 20-minute journey takes 45 minutes on the bus .
at the end of the day i was also more refreshed as i could switch off but i ca n't pack as much into a day as i usually do .
also felt fitter from walking instead of driving .
day two a disaster .
plan was to walk to train station -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- , get train -lrb- 40 mins -rrb- and walk -lrb- 25 mins -rrb- to work .
had to use car in the end .
part of my job involves encouraging people to compost and i had to dig a massive hole in my garden .
the only way was to borrow a pickaxe and pinch bar from colleagues in falkirk .
tried all kinds of possibilities like sending the tools home with colleagues but it all boiled down to me sitting on an lrt bus with a pickaxe and pinch bar that i can barely lift .
i 'm 5ft 4in so i would have looked a right eejit trying to cart them around .
breakdown bus : 0 mins train : 0 mins car : 90 mins cost : ?
car journey took 45 minutes in both directions , about 30-mile journey each way .
the aa has a journey cost calculator on their website that put the journey at just over £ 2 .
what a load of rubbish !
petrol works out far dearer than that and god knows what wear and tear on the car is .
gave all sets of keys to neighbour -lrb- including the emergency one -rrb- .
temptation is too much - not allowed them back until saturday morning .
tried leaving hardly any petrol in it as deterrent .
day three plan for the day was to get train from edinburgh to work in falkirk , then train it over to glasgow to go rock-climbing in the evening .
usually do this by car as it 's the only way i can get back to edinburgh by bedtime .
knew i would n't get back to edinburgh until really late if i used public transport so arranged to stay with friends in glasgow .
0615 get up 0700 30 mins walk to train station -lrb- bus 80p but £ 1.60 per day adds up so prefer to walk for exercise -rrb- 0735 train to falkirk - on time , sleep all the way 0810 arrive in falkirk , 25 minute walk to work , halo shining ! 1652 bus from work to falkirk high station on time - hurray !
i 'm a good walker but it 's about two-and-a-half miles to that station with a big hill at the end .
costs £ 1.30 1720 train to glasgow arrives on time , sleep all the way 1800 underground to ibrox to go to climbing centre , costs 90p 1810 arrive ibrox , 10 minute walk to climbing centre 2130 cheat and accept lift to friends ' house because i 'm not wandering around ibrox in the dark to save the planet .
general had to get single ticket to glasgow , costing £ 8.60 .
ca n't get an open return .
when you look at the bus service from edinburgh to glasgow where you can get a day return for £ 5 , this train service does n't strike me as value for money .
whilst the train fares really mount up , i once tried getting the bus home one evening and it took more than two hours to go 30 miles .
the bus seemed to stop at every hole in the hedge .
checked out http : / / www.chooseanotherway.com.
this can flag up the main transport companies in your area of choice but does n't tell you which ones are relevant to you .
traveline was much more useful , telling you which company and bus number to get , times etc , but it does n't give you the prices so it 's difficult to make a direct comparison .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.80 tried the first direct bus website to get information on timetables and fares and it was pretty poor .
if you know the answers to your questions before you go on the website you should be able to use it .
if you 're not already quite familiar , you ca n't carry out any searches and it 's very , very frustrating .
gave up on that one .
journey from work in falkirk to ibrox was definitely quicker than i could have done by car and i got to sleep for a good bit of it .
no doubt that it worked out cheaper than the car too , considering petrol and wear and tear .
public transport involves more waiting about and much , much more planning - bringing a change of clothes into work after a long walk in or a drenching .
day four have to get into work for 0800 to prepare for meetings .
had to be pretty organised and bring today 's clothes to work with me yesterday on top of my sports gear .
you wind up carrying a lot of stuff about with you on public transport that you 'd generally put in the boot of the car .
most weeks i travel to glasgow one evening for shinty practice but not this week , thank goodness .
i 'd felt ridiculous carting my gear to work and through meetings .
0625 leave friends ' house in glasgow 0630 bus into city centre , 97p 0706 train to falkirk grahamston , sleep all the way 0740 arrive falkirk , 25 minute walk to work 0805 arrive at work sweaty and bedraggled 1600 leave work on foot , 25 minute walk to station .
wet 1625 train arrives , 35 minute journey to edinburgh .
slept and dried out 1700 train arrives in edinburgh , 25 minute walk home .
wet 1830 home - hurray !
gorgeous wee car outside front door .
hardly used and i 've had it a week ! 1830 five minute walk to get bus to evening class .
bus quite prompt , 30 minute journey .
2115 half hour bus journey back from evening class , home 2145 .
car looks absolutely beautiful and cosy and tiny and must be terribly energy efficient .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.85 general have to admit that today 's journeys would have all been longer by car , more expensive and i could n't have slept .
the bus journey to the night class meant that i could leave for it later as i did n't have to trawl about looking for a parking place .
now that i 've found out the bus connections , i 'll keep using the bus for that and for the other evening class on a tuesday .
again , no parking or traffic hassles .
day five last day .
today 's an awkward one as i 've got a long-standing medical appointment at 0910 here in edinburgh and i 'm meant to start work by 1000 at the latest in falkirk .
if i was using the car , i could get there by 1015 .
that 's not going to happen today but i 've warned by boss and he was fine .
on the positive side , i can go out for a beer with my colleague after work and get the train home .
breakdown walking : 45 mins bus : 40 mins train : 65 mins cost : £ 8.10 0850 leave house for medical appointment , 15 minute walk 0920 five minute wait for bus to train station , 10 minute journey 0945 caught glasgow train to go to falkirk high .
managed to get the one that stops at every hole in the hedge but had a 30 minute sleep on the way 1015 arrived falkirk , five minute walk to bus stop and had just missed my connection .
20 minute wait 1040 bus to work , three mile walk is too far 1110 arrived at work .
took 1hr 50mins where car would have taken 45 1700 25 minute walk from work to train station , so tempting to scrounge a lift but i 'd come this far so no 1725 train arrives promptly then does that " sitting about doing nothing " stunt that they do - twice - just to keep you from getting home on a friday afternoon 1810 back in edinburgh .
25 minute walk home .
gorgeous , neglected car still there looking at me .
get keys back in the morning .
hitting the pub later on foot so that 's me done .
hurray !
verdict doing this for a week in october is n't that bad .
in the summer you can get quite manky on the way to and from work and external meetings .
i 've had to chuck clothes out .
it 'll be interesting to carry out the same survey in the colder months like february -lrb- not volunteering -rrb- .
it 's much harder not to slip into your wee temperature controlled car when it 's lashing outside and will do all day .
another big factor in the winter is the ice on paths .
in edinburgh , they do n't salt the footpaths so you ca n't walk up my street or leith walk without sweating blood trying to stay vertical .
you wind up having to walk on the roads and i 've taken the car because it 's safer than the edinburgh paths .
all in all it 's been very interesting .
i 'd like to take some of the lessons that i learned this week on , so i hope to aim to take public transport to work at least three days per week and possibly more if my employers can come up with some alternative to using my own car for site visits and meetings .
out of work i 'll definitely be taking the bus more .
i had to make the effort to find out about more of the buses in my area so i can actually get to evening classes quicker that way .
i also learned that it 's not impossible to get to places in glasgow without taking the car .
i believe there 's a vacancy for the patron saint of public transport although st christopher has got the main job covered - my application is in the post !

car journey took 45 minutes in both directions , about 30-mile journey each way .
the aa has a journey cost calculator on their website that put the journey at just over £ 2 .
what a load of rubbish !
petrol works out far dearer than that and god knows what wear and tear on the car is .
gave all sets of keys to neighbour -lrb- including the emergency one -rrb- .
temptation is too much - not allowed them back until saturday morning .
tried leaving hardly any petrol in it as deterrent .
day three plan for the day was to get train from edinburgh to work in falkirk , then train it over to glasgow to go rock-climbing in the evening .
usually do this by car as it 's the only way i can get back to edinburgh by bedtime .
knew i would n't get back to edinburgh until really late if i used public transport so arranged to stay with friends in glasgow .
0615 get up 0700 30 mins walk to train station -lrb- bus 80p but £ 1.60 per day adds up so prefer to walk for exercise -rrb- 0735 train to falkirk - on time , sleep all the way 0810 arrive in falkirk , 25 minute walk to work , halo shining ! 1652 bus from work to falkirk high station on time - hurray !
i 'm a good walker but it 's about two-and-a-half miles to that station with a big hill at the end .
costs £ 1.30 1720 train to glasgow arrives on time , sleep all the way 1800 underground to ibrox to go to climbing centre , costs 90p 1810 arrive ibrox , 10 minute walk to climbing centre 2130 cheat and accept lift to friends ' house because i 'm not wandering around ibrox in the dark to save the planet .
general had to get single ticket to glasgow , costing £ 8.60 .
ca n't get an open return .
when you look at the bus service from edinburgh to glasgow where you can get a day return for £ 5 , this train service does n't strike me as value for money .
whilst the train fares really mount up , i once tried getting the bus home one evening and it took more than two hours to go 30 miles .
the bus seemed to stop at every hole in the hedge .
checked out http : / / www.chooseanotherway.com.
this can flag up the main transport companies in your area of choice but does n't tell you which ones are relevant to you .
traveline was much more useful , telling you which company and bus number to get , times etc , but it does n't give you the prices so it 's difficult to make a direct comparison .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.80 tried the first direct bus website to get information on timetables and fares and it was pretty poor .
if you know the answers to your questions before you go on the website you should be able to use it .
if you 're not already quite familiar , you ca n't carry out any searches and it 's very , very frustrating .
gave up on that one .
journey from work in falkirk to ibrox was definitely quicker than i could have done by car and i got to sleep for a good bit of it .
no doubt that it worked out cheaper than the car too , considering petrol and wear and tear .
public transport involves more waiting about and much , much more planning - bringing a change of clothes into work after a long walk in or a drenching .
day four have to get into work for 0800 to prepare for meetings .
had to be pretty organised and bring today 's clothes to work with me yesterday on top of my sports gear .
you wind up carrying a lot of stuff about with you on public transport that you 'd generally put in the boot of the car .
most weeks i travel to glasgow one evening for shinty practice but not this week , thank goodness .
i 'd felt ridiculous carting my gear to work and through meetings .
0625 leave friends ' house in glasgow 0630 bus into city centre , 97p 0706 train to falkirk grahamston , sleep all the way 0740 arrive falkirk , 25 minute walk to work 0805 arrive at work sweaty and bedraggled 1600 leave work on foot , 25 minute walk to station .
wet 1625 train arrives , 35 minute journey to edinburgh .
slept and dried out 1700 train arrives in edinburgh , 25 minute walk home .
wet 1830 home - hurray !
gorgeous wee car outside front door .
hardly used and i 've had it a week ! 1830 five minute walk to get bus to evening class .
bus quite prompt , 30 minute journey .
2115 half hour bus journey back from evening class , home 2145 .
car looks absolutely beautiful and cosy and tiny and must be terribly energy efficient .
breakdown walking : 65 mins bus : 25 mins train : 60 mins tube : 10 mins car : 0 mins cost : £ 10.85 general have to admit that today 's journeys would have all been longer by car , more expensive and i could n't have slept .
the bus journey to the night class meant that i could leave for it later as i did n't have to trawl about looking for a parking place .
now that i 've found out the bus connections , i 'll keep using the bus for that and for the other evening class on a tuesday .
again , no parking or traffic hassles .
day five last day .
today 's an awkward one as i 've got a long-standing medical appointment at 0910 here in edinburgh and i 'm meant to start work by 1000 at the latest in falkirk .
if i was using the car , i could get there by 1015 .
that 's not going to happen today but i 've warned by boss and he was fine .
on the positive side , i can go out for a beer with my colleague after work and get the train home .
breakdown walking : 45 mins bus : 40 mins train : 65 mins cost : £ 8.10 0850 leave house for medical appointment , 15 minute walk 0920 five minute wait for bus to train station , 10 minute journey 0945 caught glasgow train to go to falkirk high .
managed to get the one that stops at every hole in the hedge but had a 30 minute sleep on the way 1015 arrived falkirk , five minute walk to bus stop and had just missed my connection .
20 minute wait 1040 bus to work , three mile walk is too far 1110 arrived at work .
took 1hr 50mins where car would have taken 45 1700 25 minute walk from work to train station , so tempting to scrounge a lift but i 'd come this far so no 1725 train arrives promptly then does that " sitting about doing nothing " stunt that they do - twice - just to keep you from getting home on a friday afternoon 1810 back in edinburgh .
25 minute walk home .
gorgeous , neglected car still there looking at me .
get keys back in the morning .
hitting the pub later on foot so that 's me done .
hurray !
verdict doing this for a week in october is n't that bad .
in the summer you can get quite manky on the way to and from work and external meetings .
i 've had to chuck clothes out .
it 'll be interesting to carry out the same survey in the colder months like february -lrb- not volunteering -rrb- .
it 's much harder not to slip into your wee temperature controlled car when it 's lashing outside and will do all day .
another big factor in the winter is the ice on paths .
in edinburgh , they do n't salt the footpaths so you ca n't walk up my street or leith walk without sweating blood trying to stay vertical .
you wind up having to walk on the roads and i 've taken the car because it 's safer than the edinburgh paths .
all in all it 's been very interesting .
i 'd like to take some of the lessons that i learned this week on , so i hope to aim to take public transport to work at least three days per week and possibly more if my employers can come up with some alternative to using my own car for site visits and meetings .
out of work i 'll definitely be taking the bus more .
i had to make the effort to find out about more of the buses in my area so i can actually get to evening classes quicker that way .
i also learned that it 's not impossible to get to places in glasgow without taking the car .
i believe there 's a vacancy for the patron saint of public transport although st christopher has got the main job covered - my application is in the post !
