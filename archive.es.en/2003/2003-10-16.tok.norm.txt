those in the know will be heading to their local aldi supermarkets come december to pick up original artwork along with their cat food and ravioli . thanks to the german discount supermarket chain , signed and numbered prints from german artists will be available in selected stores across the country for between € 10 and € 15 , making life for the casual collector as easy as buying a bottle of no frills chianti . signed , numbered and dated selling the artwork , which will come tastefully framed and set , through aldi stores is the brainchild of düsseldorf artist felix droese .
he and seven other artists , who droese refuses to name , will provide one or two original pieces which will then be reproduced before being numbered , dated and signed personally by the contributing individual .
“ i have the art and aldi has the customers , ” he told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi plans to sell around 100,000 pieces of art through 1,450 stores in its aldi south region only , limiting the amount available to around 70 artworks per supermarket .
an aldi spokesperson told deutsche welle that the decision to sell artwork through the company 's outlets was in line with aldi 's philosophy of bringing affordable and quality products to its customers . art for the masses by transforming its hundreds of stores into galleries , aldi will become the first major supermarket to mass market original art to its customers .
but it 's not alone in the trend toward opening up the once exclusive art world to everyday people . in recent years , artwork has been sold at the art supermarket in solothurn in switzerland to great acclaim .
the success of the outlet , which sold art for between € 50 and € 300 , led to the founders opening similar stores in frankfurt / main and the quartier 205 shopping centre in berlin . “ buying art is unfortunately seen by many as a luxury , ” said art supermarket director mario terés told a newspaper last year .
“ many people don ’ t even look in galleries , such is their fear . ”
so terés and two friends began importing artwork from barcelona and selling it in comfortable surroundings at affordable prices . " dumping price " proves popular similar attempts to take art from the elitists and give it back to the people have been made by underground artists in berlin who have made a successful trade in “ dumping price ” art .
in certain galleries , original artwork can be brought for as little as € 50 . however , they will have to go a long way to better the deals being offered by aldi which will not only combine even cheaper original works by , presumably , established german artists but will allow the art fancier to pick up something for the living room or private collection along with the weekly shopping . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .

those in the know will be heading to their local aldi supermarkets come december to pick up original artwork along with their cat food and ravioli . thanks to the german discount supermarket chain , signed and numbered prints from german artists will be available in selected stores across the country for between € 10 and € 15 , making life for the casual collector as easy as buying a bottle of no frills chianti . signed , numbered and dated selling the artwork , which will come tastefully framed and set , through aldi stores is the brainchild of düsseldorf artist felix droese .
he and seven other artists , who droese refuses to name , will provide one or two original pieces which will then be reproduced before being numbered , dated and signed personally by the contributing individual .
“ i have the art and aldi has the customers , ” he told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi plans to sell around 100,000 pieces of art through 1,450 stores in its aldi south region only , limiting the amount available to around 70 artworks per supermarket .
an aldi spokesperson told deutsche welle that the decision to sell artwork through the company 's outlets was in line with aldi 's philosophy of bringing affordable and quality products to its customers . art for the masses by transforming its hundreds of stores into galleries , aldi will become the first major supermarket to mass market original art to its customers .
but it 's not alone in the trend toward opening up the once exclusive art world to everyday people . in recent years , artwork has been sold at the art supermarket in solothurn in switzerland to great acclaim .
the success of the outlet , which sold art for between € 50 and € 300 , led to the founders opening similar stores in frankfurt / main and the quartier 205 shopping centre in berlin . “ buying art is unfortunately seen by many as a luxury , ” said art supermarket director mario terés told a newspaper last year .
“ many people don ’ t even look in galleries , such is their fear . ”
so terés and two friends began importing artwork from barcelona and selling it in comfortable surroundings at affordable prices . " dumping price " proves popular similar attempts to take art from the elitists and give it back to the people have been made by underground artists in berlin who have made a successful trade in “ dumping price ” art .
in certain galleries , original artwork can be brought for as little as € 50 . however , they will have to go a long way to better the deals being offered by aldi which will not only combine even cheaper original works by , presumably , established german artists but will allow the art fancier to pick up something for the living room or private collection along with the weekly shopping . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .
let 's see what happens in the coming years , " said joachim schild of the science and politics foundation in berlin , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany celebrate 40 year alliance france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .

help - that is , relief from spam - may be on the way . a european union anti-spam conference meeting in brussels on thursday is discussing how to effectively apply the eu ban on spam and quickly halt the onslaught of digital detritus . " combating spam has become a matter for us all and has become one of the most significant issues facing the internet today , " european commissioner for the information society erkki liikanen said earlier this year .
" the eu , member states , industry and consumers all have a role to play in the fight against spam both at the national and international level .
we must act before users of e-mails or sms stop using the internet or mobile services , or refrain from using it to the extent that they otherwise would . " liikanen introduced a directive banning spam in the eu in the summer .
since then it 's been up to member states to write the brussels directive into law by oct .
31 , 2003 .
under the new law , advertisers may only send commercial e-mails , faxes or text messages to eu citizens who specifically say they want it . opting in but the " opt-in " regime , as it is called , so far has n't worked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each week e-mail users in germany receive 500 million junk messages .
german law allows people afflicted by spam to pursue their tormenters , but it 's usually virtually impossible to track them down . " we can only contain the problem through an ambitious combination of legal , technical and educational measures , but above all through close international cooperation , " said patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations . the eu directive , however , only applies to e-mails that are sent or received within the union , which means that spammers from the united states or asia who send the majority of the junk mail can legally continue clogging european pipes with their undesired missives . observers hope to tackle that remaining challenge in december , when the world summit on the information society meets in geneva .
there , international consumer groups hope to pass anti-spam measures . a disservice costing billions ´ until effective action can be taken , spam will continue to plague internet users .
businesses and individuals spend more and more time deleting junk mail , and the cost in lost productivity is already tremendous .
within the eu alone companies lost an estimated € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- in 2002 . but spam is good news for some .
companies that make e-mail filters are experiencing a heyday .
profits from the sale of junk mail filters could quadruple and reach nearly $ 1 billion by 2007 , the tech research firm international data corporation recently forecast .
sales in 2003 are expected to reach € 236 million . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links world summit on the information society the official site of the december conference in geneva .

as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "

those in the know will be heading to their local aldi supermarkets come december to pick up original artwork along with their cat food and ravioli . thanks to the german discount supermarket chain , signed and numbered prints from german artists will be available in selected stores across the country for between € 10 and € 15 , making life for the casual collector as easy as buying a bottle of no frills chianti . signed , numbered and dated selling the artwork , which will come tastefully framed and set , through aldi stores is the brainchild of düsseldorf artist felix droese .
he and seven other artists , who droese refuses to name , will provide one or two original pieces which will then be reproduced before being numbered , dated and signed personally by the contributing individual .
“ i have the art and aldi has the customers , ” he told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi plans to sell around 100,000 pieces of art through 1,450 stores in its aldi south region only , limiting the amount available to around 70 artworks per supermarket .
an aldi spokesperson told deutsche welle that the decision to sell artwork through the company 's outlets was in line with aldi 's philosophy of bringing affordable and quality products to its customers . art for the masses by transforming its hundreds of stores into galleries , aldi will become the first major supermarket to mass market original art to its customers .
but it 's not alone in the trend toward opening up the once exclusive art world to everyday people . in recent years , artwork has been sold at the art supermarket in solothurn in switzerland to great acclaim .
the success of the outlet , which sold art for between € 50 and € 300 , led to the founders opening similar stores in frankfurt / main and the quartier 205 shopping centre in berlin . “ buying art is unfortunately seen by many as a luxury , ” said art supermarket director mario terés told a newspaper last year .
“ many people don ’ t even look in galleries , such is their fear . ”
so terés and two friends began importing artwork from barcelona and selling it in comfortable surroundings at affordable prices . " dumping price " proves popular similar attempts to take art from the elitists and give it back to the people have been made by underground artists in berlin who have made a successful trade in “ dumping price ” art .
in certain galleries , original artwork can be brought for as little as € 50 . however , they will have to go a long way to better the deals being offered by aldi which will not only combine even cheaper original works by , presumably , established german artists but will allow the art fancier to pick up something for the living room or private collection along with the weekly shopping . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .

as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .

as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .
let 's see what happens in the coming years , " said joachim schild of the science and politics foundation in berlin , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany celebrate 40 year alliance france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .

as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .
let 's see what happens in the coming years , " said joachim schild of the science and politics foundation in berlin , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany celebrate 40 year alliance france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .
let 's see what happens in the coming years , " said joachim schild of the science and politics foundation in berlin , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany celebrate 40 year alliance france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace .

help - that is , relief from spam - may be on the way . a european union anti-spam conference meeting in brussels on thursday is discussing how to effectively apply the eu ban on spam and quickly halt the onslaught of digital detritus . " combating spam has become a matter for us all and has become one of the most significant issues facing the internet today , " european commissioner for the information society erkki liikanen said earlier this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .

in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "

he and seven other artists , who droese refuses to name , will provide one or two original pieces which will then be reproduced before being numbered , dated and signed personally by the contributing individual .

in certain galleries , original artwork can be brought for as little as € 50 . however , they will have to go a long way to better the deals being offered by aldi which will not only combine even cheaper original works by , presumably , established german artists but will allow the art fancier to pick up something for the living room or private collection along with the weekly shopping . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.10.2003 chirac to speak for germany at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will pass the reins to chirac on friday as he heads back to berlin for a crunch vote french president jacques chirac will represent gerhard schröder in his absence at this week 's european union summit .
as schröder returns to berlin on friday , chirac will speak for germany in an unprecedented move . for some , it is an unprecedented and unsettling move that has sent ripples of concern through the european union .
for others , it is merely a curiosity that has generated mumbled discussions on the strangeness of it all in the corridors of power . but whatever the standpoint , the news that french president jacques chirac has formally agreed to represent german chancellor gerhard schröder in his absence at a european summit this week will confirm that the level of relations between the two leaders and their countries is at an all-time high . an event of huge symbolism while schröder is back at the bundestag , germany 's parliament , battling for his political future in the crucial reform vote on friday morning , chirac will be representing his counterpart at a meeting that until a few days ago would not have made many headlines . despite the attendance of a number of eu leaders to discuss the european constitution and how to boost economic growth , no major decisions are expected at the summit on friday .
but no one should doubt the symbolism of a french president standing in for a german chancellor at any occasion , especially considering the chilly start the two leaders had . still , some diplomats believe that the move may send a bad signal to smaller states within the european union .
in the context of the current discussion about the future distribution of voting rights in the european council and how many seats there should be on the european commission the move could alienate smaller members who think the larger member states germany and france are forming a political bloc . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the smaller states may have a point , but the issue of chirac speaking for germany is being blown out of proportion .
he told reporters : “ i believe , on the one hand , that they interpret this correctly , that it is something new .
on the other hand , it is also being overrated .
of course , we have a narrow agreement and besides , we all must be in the bundestag on friday . ” the franco-german relationship has , until recently , not been the most comfortable .
the number of wars fought between the two countries in modern times aside , tensions reached serious levels three years ago when chirac strongly objected to schröder ’ s request that germany ’ s post-unification population , 82 million compared with 60 million french , be reflected in the voting allocation in brussels .
the ire was reversed when schröder was riled by chirac ’ s support for edmund stoiber - the opposition candidate in last year 's german elections . opposition brought them together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder took abuse over their anti-war stance .
but the reason for the strengthening of ties between the two leaders can be summed up in one word : iraq .
while resolutions flew back and forth at the united nations , and calls for and against war echoed around the world , paris and berlin emerged as the biggest critics of washington ’ s policy .
the result was a campaign of character assassination by u.s. officials and pro-war corners of the media , which insiders compared to putting the two european leaders through fire .
the experience forged a bond between the two statesmen .
the joining of the two nations on a higher level came later when they celebrated the 40th anniversary of the elysée treaty , the resumption of diplomatic ties after world war ii , in january and grabbed that opportunity to push the relationship forward into a more intimate future . now , in the wake of the war , franco-german relations are tighter than ever before , with consultations between the two nations at an unprecedented level .
there are ministerial meetings between the two countries every six weeks , the governments hold joint cabinet meetings , and even have civil servants in each other 's ministries .
so , when jacques chirac speaks for germany on friday , it will be a historical peak in an increasingly close and important axis . a strong political signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with differences in the past , the franco-german axis is comfortable and strong .
" this underlines how close we are , " one berlin official said .
" if germany should have any input to make for friday 's conclusions , president chirac will present them . "
another official was more succinct : " gerhard trusts jacques . " " it 's a show of closeness , " henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute , a think-tank on bilateral relations , told reuters .
" chirac will perhaps two or three times make a show of saying ' and by the way , my friend schröder says so and so ' ...
if you like , it 's a gimmick , but it 's also a very strong political signal . " meanwhile , european commission president romano prodi hailed the move .
" it is another step towards overcoming narrow nationalism .
i am totally in favor of it , " prodi told reporters on wednesday .
he added that it may not be the last time one leader represents more than one country . a changing europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder with romano prodi in berlin .
" it may well be a system that we will see repeated .
we 're in a changing europe , where certain traditional barriers might be breaking down ...
ok , it 's france and germany this time .
but i do n't view this as a little group being distinct from everyone else .
these people are doing it perfectly innocently , " prodi said . however , others were far less charitable .
hans-gert pöttering , a german member of the european parliament who leads the center-right european people 's party , said that schröder was showing contempt for his european commitments and risked making germany a " lame duck on the european political stage . " mep calls schröder 's maneuver risky pöttering called the move a " risky maneuver " which " recalled the politics of the empty chair , " a strategy employed by former french president charles de gaulle , who in 1965 withdrew france 's representatives from meetings in protest at a plan to increase the eu 's budget .
other german meps took a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the controversy .
elmar brok , from the german opposition party the christian democratic union , told the daily die welt , " anyway , german interests will be better served by the french president than the chancellor . "
yet to rival mitterrand and kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl but political analysts said that despite the apparent closeness of schröder and chirac , it was way too early to compare the current franco-german axis to its heyday under their predecessors , francois mitterrand and helmut kohl .
" schröder and chirac have n't yet had comparable challenges to tackle as kohl and mitterrand had with the decision to introduce the euro .
let 's see what happens in the coming years , " said joachim schild of the science and politics foundation in berlin , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany celebrate 40 year alliance france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace .

the fund is aimed at staving off the rush of asbestos lawsuits , with the fund ending the victims ' right to go to court to sue for compensation .
the plan was brokered by the office of senate republican leader bill frist , after insurers and companies squabbled over who should pay what into the fund .
even though the industry has now managed to agree on the size of the fund , it could still face fierce opposition from trial lawyers and labour unions who have lobbied against the fund saying it is too small .
" clearly this is a significant and meaningful step forward between two major parties to the larger asbestos negotiations , " said senator bill frist .
but comments from a labor federation spokesmen immediately suggested that they were not happy with the size of the fund .
" we 'll keep an open mind , but it 's extremely unlikely that anything will be worked out , " said jonathan hiatt , from the afl-cio labor federation .
bankruptcy fears thousands of lawsuits filed by victims of asbestos have already driven 67 us companies into bankruptcy .
there are an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 victims still seeking compensation .
asbestos was widely used for fireproofing and insulation until the 1970s when it was linked to cancer and other diseases .
the insurers have agreed to pay $ 46bn into the fund , with the defendant firms making up the rest .
but the american insurance association has stressed that it will only pay its share on the condition that lawmakers ditch an amendment that would allow victims to return to court if the fund money runs out .

the department of the environment has proposed to increase the current penalty from £ 25 up to £ 50 as part of a 12-week consultation exercise .
it hopes to put the fixed penalty in place next year .
doe spokesman chris savage said littering and dog fouling remained a concern to the public and the government .
" this will act as a greater deterrent and help to improve the quality of our local environment , " he said .
" the increase also brings our fixed penalty into line with those in britain and we will also be looking at ways in which legislation on litter can be improved and made more effective . "

but thursday 's announcement will disappoint hopes of a resolution of the gm debate .
protesters have uprooted gm crops the results are expected to show that wildlife was harmed in field trials of gm oilseed rape and sugar beet varieties , while gm maize fields were much less affected .
ministers will be unable to claim the trials give gm crops a clear green light .
the results will be published in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society : biological sciences .
the trials , known as farm-scale evaluations -lrb- fses -rrb- , are the largest scientific experiment of their kind on gm crops anywhere in the world .
gene flow the government opted for them in 1999 , to assess the impact on wildlife of plants genetically modified to tolerate certain herbicides .
three crops were chosen : oilseed rape , sugar beet and maize , with the gm versions planted alongside their conventional equivalents for comparison .
q & a : gm crop trials monsanto departure pleases greens the trials were criticised as too narrowly focused , looking at what the gm crops might do to farmland creatures , but ignoring other possible effects such as damage to consumers ' health , cross-pollination with other plants , harm to soil organisms , and the long-term transfer of modified genes creating so-called superweeds .
there were protests against the fses , and crops in some trial fields were pulled up .
but the government decided it had enough data to make the experiment worthwhile and pressed ahead .
monsanto pullout on the eve of the publication of the trial results , anti-gm campaigners claimed a victory after the biotech giant monsanto announced it was pulling out of the european cereal seed business .
the firm said on wednesday its research centre in trumpington , cambridge , will close with the loss of about 80 jobs .
the company blamed the failure in the growth of a market in hybrid wheat seeds for the decision , saying it had " failed to materialise " .
it said it was " streamlining " its operations .
but friends of the earth said monsanto " set up the operation in cambridge five years ago with the clear intention of introducing gm wheat and barley into europe .
this has been a pretty abject failure . "
consumer resistance in the last few months , though , a series of reports has come out against the commercial planting of gm crops in the uk , at least for now .
in july the cabinet office strategy unit said they would bring little short-term benefit to the british economy , with lack of consumer demand limiting farmers ' willingness to grow them .
it did say that future gm crops might offer benefits to both farmers and consumers .
ten days later the government 's gm science review panel said the crops posed a very low risk to human health , but it expressed doubts about their possible environmental impact , especially on wildlife .
the government 's chief scientist told bbc news online precaution should prevail , and the existing moratorium on growing gm crops should stay in place .
in september the results of a nationwide debate showed " caution and doubt , through suspicion and scepticism , to hostility and rejection " towards gms from the 40,000 people who took part .
the results of the farm scale evaluations are supposed to remain a secret until they are announced .
but press reports suggest they will say the gm oilseed rape and modified beet seem to do more harm to plants and insects than conventional crops , and should not be grown commercially .
chemical row the reports say maize does less harm , and so might win approval as a wildlife-friendly crop .
opponents of gms say the maize tests were invalid and should be repeated , because the herbicide used on the conventional control crop was atrazine , to be phased out by the european union .
they say its replacement may well be more benign to wildlife , cancelling out the advantage which gm maize appears to enjoy .
the biotechnology industry says this is a red herring , arguing atrazine is used on only about half the maize grown in the uk , and the tests were to see whether it was better to apply a herbicide to germinating weeds or later in their growth .
so the stage is set for another inconclusive attempt to decide for or against growing gm crops in the uk .
neither side is holding its breath .

opponents of gms say the maize tests were invalid and should be repeated , because the herbicide used on the conventional control crop was atrazine , to be phased out by the european union .
they say its replacement may well be more benign to wildlife , cancelling out the advantage which gm maize appears to enjoy .
the biotechnology industry says this is a red herring , arguing atrazine is used on only about half the maize grown in the uk , and the tests were to see whether it was better to apply a herbicide to germinating weeds or later in their growth .

what everyone remembers about the younger aliyev is his reputed fondness for high living and the roulette table .
five years ago , aliyev senior abruptly ordered all casinos in azerbaijan to be closed , as reports circulated that ilham aliyev was massively in debt to a shady turkish gambling magnate .

he is plump , suavely dressed , speaks fluent english and has a ready smile .
vote for me as i am the only one who will continue aliyev 's chosen path ...
i have tried and will try to be more and more like him ilham aliyev at last rally on monday but as a politician he remains awkward .
he has benefited from an expensive and glitzy campaign , but correspondents say he has been ill-at-ease when meeting voters .
" he is a highly intellectual individual who has a pragmatic approach to tackling issues , has a very good knowledge of the modern world , politics and economics , is energetic and has initiative , " said heydar aliyev , earlier this month , anointing his son as his political successor .
the intelligence company stratfor.com , which is reported to have links to the cia , put it another way : " ilham aliyev lacks his father 's charisma , political skills , contacts , experience , stature , intelligence and authority .
aside from that he will make a wonderful president . "
analysts are divided on how long he will last as president .
some see him as a transitional figure who will ensure a smooth succession , before handing over at some point in the future to another member of the ruling clan .
despite being first deputy chairman of the new azerbaijan party he was nominated for the presidency not by the party but by a group of voters in the exclave of nakhichevan , -lrb- sandwiched between armenia and iran -rrb- which has always been the aliyevs ' power base .
money cushion for now it is unclear whether ilham aliyev will run the clan , or whether it will run him .
whatever happens , he has enough money to live in comfort abroad , and may well prefer that to the stresses and strains of political leadership .
ilham aliyev was born in 1961 , the year after his father rose to head the kgb in azerbaijan .
he graduated from moscow 's prestigious state institute for international relations -lrb- mgimo -rrb- in 1982 , the year his father joined the soviet politburo , and later gained a phd in history .
he got his job at azerbaijan 's state oil company the year after his father became president of newly-independent azerbaijan .
his first ambition , reportedly , was to become a soviet diplomat , but the ussr collapsed before he could realise it .
it was as a businessman in moscow and istanbul between 1991 and 1994 that he began to earn his playboy reputation .
he is married with three children .

long-serving councillors in wales have just five weeks to decide whether to retire from local politics , and claim up to £ 20,000 .
it follows wednesday 's decision by the welsh assembly members who narrowly supported a controversial policy of offering ' golden goodbyes ' to local councillors who have more than 16 years service .
the labour run assembly government says the idea behind the policy is to bring in new blood to local authorities in wales , making it more representative of the population as a whole .
women , people from ethnic minorities are being particularly targeted .
but opposition parties who voted against the plan say they payments are nothing more than an " immoral bribe " and a " democratic culling " of older councillors .
those councillors now have until 20 november to decide whether or not to retire at the next local government elections in may or june next year .
if they do stand down , so long as they have been on the council for 16 years , they will be eligible to claim up to £ 20,000 - or £ 1,000 for each year of their service .
sue essex said the payouts would ' benefit democracy ' steve thomas , head of policy at the welsh local government association , welcomed the move to offer the " golden goodbyes " .
he said the scheme was about encouraging involvement in local goverment from a wider representation of society .
" we are talking about paying £ 20,000 to councillors who have given their heart and soul to communities over 16 years . "
" if we want people to contibute to a vibrant local democracy we have to up the stakes . "
ahead of the vote there was a mixed opposition to the plan - first put forward in july by wales ' local government minister sue essex .
white male the payments , she claimed , would benefit democracy in wales by encouraging new , younger candidates to stand .
" this is an important initiative in the drive to encourage more people to enter local government which needs to be made more attractive to people of all ages and backgrounds , " she said .
" the typical councillor in wales is white male , older than the average and retired .

long-serving councillors in wales have just five weeks to decide whether to retire from local politics , and claim up to £ 20,000 .
it follows wednesday 's decision by the welsh assembly members who narrowly supported a controversial policy of offering ' golden goodbyes ' to local councillors who have more than 16 years service .
the labour run assembly government says the idea behind the policy is to bring in new blood to local authorities in wales , making it more representative of the population as a whole .
women , people from ethnic minorities are being particularly targeted .
but opposition parties who voted against the plan say they payments are nothing more than an " immoral bribe " and a " democratic culling " of older councillors .
those councillors now have until 20 november to decide whether or not to retire at the next local government elections in may or june next year .
if they do stand down , so long as they have been on the council for 16 years , they will be eligible to claim up to £ 20,000 - or £ 1,000 for each year of their service .
sue essex said the payouts would ' benefit democracy ' steve thomas , head of policy at the welsh local government association , welcomed the move to offer the " golden goodbyes " .
he said the scheme was about encouraging involvement in local goverment from a wider representation of society .
" we are talking about paying £ 20,000 to councillors who have given their heart and soul to communities over 16 years . "
" if we want people to contibute to a vibrant local democracy we have to up the stakes . "
ahead of the vote there was a mixed opposition to the plan - first put forward in july by wales ' local government minister sue essex .
white male the payments , she claimed , would benefit democracy in wales by encouraging new , younger candidates to stand .
" this is an important initiative in the drive to encourage more people to enter local government which needs to be made more attractive to people of all ages and backgrounds , " she said .
" the typical councillor in wales is white male , older than the average and retired .
" these people have given sterling service to their communities but we can not be satisfied with the situation where local government is so unrepresentative of the electorate . "
tory party ams - who has called for a referendum - said the scheme was the " sale of the century " as well as being " ageist " .

bbc news online examines what the controversy is about .
why are the chief executives being interviewed ?
bank of england interest rates are now at a forty year low , and big banks can borrow more cheaply than ever before .
however they stand accused of not passing on this boon to their credit card customers in the form of lower annual percentage rates -lrb- apr -rrb- .
in short the banks will be asked whether they offer their customers a fair deal .
and there is another crucial issue : the size of uk consumer debt is rising sharply , and mps may ask whether banks are cautious enough .
some experts worry that people are getting loans who may not be able to pay them back .
but i thought lots of credit cards had swanky special offers attached ?
the credit card market is more competitive than ever .
in the mid 1990 's new entrants , many from the united states , started to tempt customers with special offers and low introductory aprs .
people flocked to the new providers in their droves , although many kept their old credit cards with the big four banks .
in fact , the big four banks , thanks in part to their stranglehold on the current account market , still retain by far the biggest slice of the credit card market .
unfortunately , as rule of thumb the big banks offer rates that are a long way from the most competitive credit cards on the market .
is it only the big banks that are being investigated ?
not at all , in the summer the treasury select committee hauled the store card industry over the coals .
leading card issuers were accused of being ' designer loan sharks ' for the apr rates they charged store card customers .
following on from the select committee mauling , the office of fair trading launched an inquiry into the store card market .
the oft now wants to find out whether the industry engages in " unsatisfactory practices " , and whether it is competitive enough .
but is n't that all talk ?
can the mps really get things changed ?
at first glance the answer is " no " .
they ca n't order firms to change their lending practices .
in truth , the real legislative work is going on behind the scenes as the government prepares an update of the 1974 consumer credit act .
the act in its present form has been roundly criticised by consumer groups as lacking teeth and being behind the times .
the government has already indicated that the update will include tough measures to clamp down on loan sharks .
the select committee , through its examination of the uk credit and store card markets , could have an indirect influence on the shaping of an updated consumer credit act .
is that all ?
what else can they do ?
well , plans for so-called " honesty " tables , aimed at making card charges more transparent , were brought forward following criticism by the committee .
in august apacs , a credit card industry body , told bbc news online that it planed to introduce the tables , also known as schumer boxes , in early 2004 - two years earlier than planned .
a schumer box draws together all the disclosures spread throughout the small print of a credit agreement into a box format , the idea being that such presentation makes it easy to understand and to compare different credit card products .
john mcfall mp , chairman of the treasury select committee , had written to leading card issuers asking them to bring forward the launch of the new format to show credit card charges .

local newspapers have printed the photographs and names of the 23 suspended judges .
the president said in a statement the tribunal would investigate " allegations that the said judges ... have been involved in corruption , unethical practices and absence of integrity in the performance of the functions of their office " .
a report released last month said corruption was rampant in the kenyan legal system , with almost half of the country 's judges and close to a third of its magistrates said to be corrupt .
president kibaki , who was elected last year , vowed to rid the country of corruption to win back donor support and made cleaning up the judiciary a key target .
the international monetary fund stopped lending to kenya three years ago because of the country 's corruption .
damning report president kibaki said the tribunal would investigate six of the country 's nine judges in the court of appeals - the highest court - and 17 judges out of the 36 in the high court .
the judges , who were named for the first time , have been suspended with immediate effect while the investigations are being conducted .
the tribunal investigating the high court judges is to be chaired by influential kenyan constitutional lawyer lee muthoga , while the panel investigating the court of appeal judges will be headed by prominent ghanaian judge akilano akiwumi .
the president 's decision to name the tribunals came after the judges implicated in the ringera report released at the end of september were given the option to either resign and leave quietly or be investigated by tribunals .
officials say they have evidence corrupt judges took bribes from litigants to rule in their favour , delayed ruling on cases in return for bribes , had engaged in business outside the judiciary and were living beyond their known means .

farmers , who say they are earning less per litre now than they were five years ago , will be converging on the uk 's largest milk distribution plant in warwickshire to make their point .
in the last five years a third of the dairy farms in kent and sussex have gone out of business .
in 1997 there were nearly 500 dairy farmers , but by 2002 that was down to below 350 . "
dairy farmers can not go on receiving prices below the real cost of production " william white , nfu south east food and farming adviser those that are left say they are earning less than at any time since the milk marketing board was disbanded over a decade ago .
thursday night 's peaceful protest will emphasise that a 2p per litre rise in the farm-gate price for liquid milk is vital to the future of the industry .
among the protesters at dairy crest 's flagship distribution centre and cheese factory in nuneaton will be farmers from kent , sussex , surrey , oxfordshire , berkshire and buckinghamshire .
farmers argue that although the biggest retailers - the supermarkets - have put up the price of milk , they are not seeing any of the extra cash .
drop in farm-gate prices at the moment they get an average price of 17p for every litre of milk they sell .
five years ago they earned an average of 24p a litre .
virtually all of them sell their milk through a co-operative to producers , and farmers say it is the producers who have to pass on some of their profits .
nfu south east food and farming adviser william white said : " dairy farmers can not go on receiving prices below the real cost of production .
" six years of poor prices have forced the milk industry to contract alarmingly .
" those remaining in milk production have made investments for the future and it is only fair that they should receive a price above the true cost of production . "

farmers , who say they are earning less per litre now than they were five years ago , will be converging on the uk 's largest milk distribution plant in warwickshire to make their point .
in the last five years a third of the dairy farms in kent and sussex have gone out of business .
in 1997 there were nearly 500 dairy farmers , but by 2002 that was down to below 350 .
dairy farmers can not go on receiving prices below the real cost of production william white , nfu south east food and farming adviser those that are left say they are earning less than at any time since the milk marketing board was disbanded over a decade ago .
thursday night 's peaceful protest will emphasise that a 2p per litre rise in the farm-gate price for liquid milk is vital to the future of the industry .

drop in farm-gate prices at the moment they get an average price of 17p for every litre of milk they sell .
five years ago they earned an average of 24p a litre .
virtually all of them sell their milk through a co-operative to producers , and farmers say it is the producers who have to pass on some of their profits .
nfu south east food and farming adviser william white said : " dairy farmers can not go on receiving prices below the real cost of production .
" six years of poor prices have forced the milk industry to contract alarmingly .
" those remaining in milk production have made investments for the future and it is only fair that they should receive a price above the true cost of production . "
