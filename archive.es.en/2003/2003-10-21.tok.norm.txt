confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

a recent mission in the congo , where a french-led eu force of 1,500 troops cooled tensions between rival tribes in the north of the country , is a prime example of that . united states nato officials counter that a cooperation agreement signed by nato and the eu in berlin this year already enables european countries to access nato assets needed for such missions .
they argue a separate planning structure would only endanger the transatlantic alliance at a time when it is undergoing a post-cold war transformation . officials high up in the european union , like the foreign policy chief javier solana , have sought to talk down the perceived transatlantic tension . " this is nothing new , " he said of differences within the eu .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .

iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .

at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .

with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .

one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge .
-lrb- september 20 , 2003 -rrb- for leipzig , the olympic dream begins as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible .
-lrb- july 15 , 2003 -rrb- and the winner is ...
leipzig after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany .
-lrb- april 13 , 2003 -rrb- feedback what impact , if any , do you feel the stasi scandal will have on leipzig 's 2012 olympics bid ?

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2003 iran agrees to inspections after eu talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi pledged transparency , joschka fischer sighed with relief the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks . in a dramatic turn of events , iran has agreed to sign and ratify an agreement on tougher inspections of its nuclear sites after tense discussions with foreign ministers from the european union ’ s " big three " - germany , france and britain .
the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javad dabiran , a member of the iranian resistance council , presents a satellite picture of nuclear facilities in natanz , iran .
a suspect discovery following the discovery of traces of highly enriched uranium by iaea inspectors at an iranian nuclear facility earlier this year , the vienna-based organization passed a resolution demanding an explanation . it has also demanded that iran sign an additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty stating it will provide details on suspected attempts to redivert nuclear material to a weapons program . iran has maintained all along that its nuclear program is purely intended for civilian energy use . but the administration of u.s. president george w. bush , who included iran in his " axis of evil " along side iraq and north korea , has been pressuring the international community to take action against iran , which it suspects of developing nuclear weapons . following a meeting with bush last month , russian president vladimir putin said his country was willing to work together with iran to abandon any nuclear ambitions it had . friendly ties under strain traditionally friendly ties between germany and iran have been under tension recently as a result of the nuclear dispute .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge .
-lrb- september 20 , 2003 -rrb- for leipzig , the olympic dream begins as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?

when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .

meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .

a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .

iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .

british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

a recent mission in the congo , where a french-led eu force of 1,500 troops cooled tensions between rival tribes in the north of the country , is a prime example of that . united states nato officials counter that a cooperation agreement signed by nato and the eu in berlin this year already enables european countries to access nato assets needed for such missions .
they argue a separate planning structure would only endanger the transatlantic alliance at a time when it is undergoing a post-cold war transformation . officials high up in the european union , like the foreign policy chief javier solana , have sought to talk down the perceived transatlantic tension .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge .
-lrb- september 20 , 2003 -rrb- for leipzig , the olympic dream begins as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible .

leipzig after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany .

a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "

iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.10.2003 stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk thärichen resigned from the olympic committee after it surfaced he had secret police connections .
the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .

at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .

but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

a recent mission in the congo , where a french-led eu force of 1,500 troops cooled tensions between rival tribes in the north of the country , is a prime example of that . united states nato officials counter that a cooperation agreement signed by nato and the eu in berlin this year already enables european countries to access nato assets needed for such missions .
they argue a separate planning structure would only endanger the transatlantic alliance at a time when it is undergoing a post-cold war transformation . officials high up in the european union , like the foreign policy chief javier solana , have sought to talk down the perceived transatlantic tension . " this is nothing new , " he said of differences within the eu .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "

iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

a suspect discovery following the discovery of traces of highly enriched uranium by iaea inspectors at an iranian nuclear facility earlier this year , the vienna-based organization passed a resolution demanding an explanation . it has also demanded that iran sign an additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty stating it will provide details on suspected attempts to redivert nuclear material to a weapons program . iran has maintained all along that its nuclear program is purely intended for civilian energy use . but the administration of u.s. president george w. bush , who included iran in his " axis of evil " along side iraq and north korea , has been pressuring the international community to take action against iran , which it suspects of developing nuclear weapons . following a meeting with bush last month , russian president vladimir putin said his country was willing to work together with iran to abandon any nuclear ambitions it had . friendly ties under strain traditionally friendly ties between germany and iran have been under tension recently as a result of the nuclear dispute .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .

german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .

at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .

" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2003 iran agrees to inspections after eu talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi pledged transparency , joschka fischer sighed with relief the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks . in a dramatic turn of events , iran has agreed to sign and ratify an agreement on tougher inspections of its nuclear sites after tense discussions with foreign ministers from the european union ’ s " big three " - germany , france and britain .
the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .

at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

a suspect discovery following the discovery of traces of highly enriched uranium by iaea inspectors at an iranian nuclear facility earlier this year , the vienna-based organization passed a resolution demanding an explanation . it has also demanded that iran sign an additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty stating it will provide details on suspected attempts to redivert nuclear material to a weapons program . iran has maintained all along that its nuclear program is purely intended for civilian energy use . but the administration of u.s. president george w. bush , who included iran in his " axis of evil " along side iraq and north korea , has been pressuring the international community to take action against iran , which it suspects of developing nuclear weapons . following a meeting with bush last month , russian president vladimir putin said his country was willing to work together with iran to abandon any nuclear ambitions it had . friendly ties under strain traditionally friendly ties between germany and iran have been under tension recently as a result of the nuclear dispute .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge .
-lrb- september 20 , 2003 -rrb- for leipzig , the olympic dream begins as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible .
-lrb- july 15 , 2003 -rrb- and the winner is ...
leipzig after a year of hard work , leipzig was named germany 's olympic candidate city for the 2012 summer games .
together with rostock , the german bid for the sailing competition , it hopes to bring the olympics back to germany .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .

instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .
19 .
at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .
if selected , leipzig and rostock would gain the opportunity to showcase the incredible progress that 's been made in reunifying germany , provide yet another symbolic bookend to the cold war and provide an economic shot in the arm to a region that has struggled to rebuild its economy after the collapse of communism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ?

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

a recent mission in the congo , where a french-led eu force of 1,500 troops cooled tensions between rival tribes in the north of the country , is a prime example of that . united states nato officials counter that a cooperation agreement signed by nato and the eu in berlin this year already enables european countries to access nato assets needed for such missions .
they argue a separate planning structure would only endanger the transatlantic alliance at a time when it is undergoing a post-cold war transformation . officials high up in the european union , like the foreign policy chief javier solana , have sought to talk down the perceived transatlantic tension . " this is nothing new , " he said of differences within the eu .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .

german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .

one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .

with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .

when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .

it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .

rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .

with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .

the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .
now the search begins for the person who can save the campaign . the cities of leipzig and rostock sought to regain some credibility over the weekend for their scandal-ridden joint olympic bid by announcing a partnership that the organizing committee hopes will find new managers to save the campaign to host the prestigious sporting event .
instead of actually naming a successor to the disgraced former head , dirk thärichen , the committee announced on sunday that thomas middelhoff , the former chief of media giant bertelsmann , and bernd rauch , the vice president of soccer club bayern munich , will coordinate the search for a replacement to lead leipzig 's troubled bid .
they hope to have a new chief in place by nov .

at the same time , the german team unveiled the leipzig-rostock campaign logo , a modern take on the olympic flame in the colors of the five famous rings which adorn the games ' flag .
it cries " business as normal " but behind the scenes , uncertainty remains a disturbing undercurrent of the german bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder announced the winners in april .
the campaign was thrown into turmoil recently when thärichen , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , and harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly run olympic marketing committee , resigned over allegations of involvement with the former east german secret police and complicity in a number of financial irregularities .
respected men search for new leader with the smell of scandal still lingering , the german organizing team were in desperate need of a damage control exercise , and the appointment of two respected men to head the search for a successor has been heralded as a step in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily .
german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- outlined the kind of person middelhoff and rauch would be looking for : " we are looking for someone with strong management qualities , who knows how to handle public money . "
but it was what schily didn ’ t say that echoed loudest throughout the committee ’ s halls .
as important as strong management is , a past free of the stain of espionage and stasi secret police organization is just as crucial .
the rumours and accusations of an alleged connection between thärichen , lochotzke and the secret police have been the primary force threatening to derail the german olympic bid .
since reunification in 1989 , germany has been working hard to send out a message of integration , of one country working towards a brighter future .
when it was announced in april this year that leipzig had beaten out competition from hamburg , frankfurt , düsseldorf and stuttgart to be germany 's official bid city to host the 2012 games , it was seen as a shot in the arm for the depressed region , which is still struggling to catch up with the more prosperous west more than a decade after reunification .
dark history however , dark shadows associated with the rule of the communist regime and its steroid-fuelled sporting machine continue to plague the eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archives in berlin .
one particularly touchy issue remains that of the stasi , the secret police who recruited citizens to inform on neighbors , family and friends and who kept detailed files -lrb- photo -rrb- on all those who collaborated with and opposed the communist regime .
it is still possible for people to be barred from employment possibilities in many professions if it can be proven that the person served as a stasi informant or worker .
former head served in stasi unit in the case of thärichen , his secret police past came back to haunt him after the german daily die welt revealed that as a 19-year-old , he had served briefly for the stasi 's feliks dzerzhinsky guard unit , a division involved in putting down pro-democracy demonstrations in early 1989 which took its name from the founder of the k.g.b. wolfgang tiefensee , the mayor of leipzig , addressed the stasi allegations on local television at the time of thärichen ’ s resignation , saying : " i must realize that the time has not yet come in germany where this issue can be discussed in an unbiased way , especially in connection with the olympic bid . "
rostock chief was informer further media investigations , this time by der spiegel magazine , helped bring lochotzke 's collaboration to light .
a look into the stasi files , which can be released under certain conditions , revealed that lochotzke worked for the stasi as an informer from 1986 until 1989 under the code name kay birkhoff .
the files also detail stipends and gifts awarded to him by the stasi .
they also document his alleged involvement in shady business dealings in rostock in the years immediately after the fall of the berlin wall .
ioc frowns on scandal the disclosures have decreased the chances of what was already expected to be a long shot bid .
not only are leipzig and rostock up against the stiff competition presented by new york , london , paris , istanbul , madrid , moscow , rio de janeiro and havana but the german bid also faces detailed examination by the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which is still sensitive to charges of corruption after the scandal that emerged from the selection of salt lake city to play host to the 2002 games .
however , walter tröger , a german representative at the ioc , told reporters that regardless of what has occured in leipzig , the ioc maintains that its selection process for future host cities will continue to focus on the suitability of proposed sporting venues , surrounding infrastructure and security measures .
he added that the leipzig bid is progressing as mapped out in its proposal and that the joint bid with rostock will make the first phase of ioc approvals in 2005 .
" i am sure that -lrb- the bid -rrb- will get registered by the ioc .
i believe that leipzig has a good chance ...
as a plan , it does not lie .
the plan is in order . "
with nearly three years remaining before the ioc selects the host city for the 2012 games , the scandal could still blow over .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .
steps to strengthen the european defense industry and form a rapid reaction force that can be deployable anywhere in the world have only recently been taken by eu countries . europe still needs u.s. military europe remains very dependent on u.s. military capabilities and on nato 's logistic , transport and communication networks , but has varying visions of a command center for missions it takes on without u.s. help . so far , there have been three different proposals : the tervuren-based center proposed by the four countries , a plan by italy to set up a virtual , computer-based planning center and a british bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .

confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday . u.s. and european union diplomats apparently ended a transatlantic spat over proposed plans to set up a european military command center outside the nato alliance . after a meeting called by u.s. nato ambassador nicholas burns monday , ambassadors and the nato spokesman said all sides agreed that the european union 's military ambitions were n't a threat to nato . " we all agreed that no one is trying to damage nato , " spokesman jamie shea told reporters . until now , military action undertaken by eu countries has mostly been under the umbrella of nato , which has the necessary planning and logistical network needed for big missions like those in afghanistan or bosnia . but an informal agreement between the eu 's three biggest members - france , germany and the uk - to set up an eu planning structure independent of the transatlantic alliance has confused officials in washington . the plans reignited concerns that the eu was striving to become a counterweight to the united states and wanted to make nato redundant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato , hauptquartier , bruxelles , burns called the plans " the greatest threat to nato " and called the emergency meeting of 19 nato ambassadors on monday to clear things up . a stronger ally that might be easier said than done .
europe 's goal of establishing a common security and defense policy in the past year has been marked by division within the eu and has led to tension in the transatlantic alliance . at a summit last april , belgium , germany , france and luxembourg agreed to strengthen the european union 's military capabilities and set up a separate command structure in tervuren , near brussels .
that conference angered a lot of pro-iraq war u.s. allies like spain and great britain in the european union , who felt the four were trying to go their own way . the u.s. accused the four countries of wanting to de-couple europe from nato .
the summit participants countered that the goal was to make the eu a more effective ally , not a counterweight , to nato . the cold truth is that the european union , featuring countries with few highly trained troops and low defense budgets , is a long away from providing any competition to the united states , defense experts say .

the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "

iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2003 iran agrees to inspections after eu talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi pledged transparency , joschka fischer sighed with relief the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks . in a dramatic turn of events , iran has agreed to sign and ratify an agreement on tougher inspections of its nuclear sites after tense discussions with foreign ministers from the european union ’ s " big three " - germany , france and britain .
the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.10.2003 iran agrees to inspections after eu talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister kamal kharrazi pledged transparency , joschka fischer sighed with relief the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks . in a dramatic turn of events , iran has agreed to sign and ratify an agreement on tougher inspections of its nuclear sites after tense discussions with foreign ministers from the european union ’ s " big three " - germany , france and britain .
the declaration on tuesday included a statement that the tehran regime would suspend its uranium enrichment and processing program and comply with an october 31 u.n. deadline to dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions and ease international fears over iran ’ s alleged quest to become a nuclear power .
a promising start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister dominique de villepin although optimism was running high in the immediate wake of the announcement , both the iranians and the eu delegation refused to place too much emphasis on the day ’ s events .
one senior iranian official told reporters that the decision to freeze the uranium enrichment program was only a temporary measure , designed to be seen as a sign of trust and of peaceful intent on iran ’ s part .
meanwhile , dominique de villepin , the french foreign minister , referred to the move as a " promising start . "
no specific date was set for the undertakings by iran , but sources within the iranian delegation were confident that the protocol on nuclear checks would be signed before the next international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- board meeting at its headquarters in vienna on november 20 .
iran 's supreme national security council chief hassan rohani told reporters that he didn ’ t think the iranians would sign before october 31 but probably before the iaea convened for its november session .
on the subject of uranium enrichment , rohani said : " we voluntarily chose to do it which means it could last for one day or one year , it depends on us .
as long as iran thinks that this suspension is beneficial for us it will continue , and whenever we do n't want it we will end it . "
iaea report may still be damaging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has warned iran that its case may go before the u.n. security council if he can not confidently tell his colleagues in his november report that iran has no intention of building nuclear weapons .
but a western diplomat in vienna told reuters that iran ’ s concessions may not be enough to prevent a negative report by elbaradei .
" this does n't mean it 's over by a longshot , " the diplomat said .
despite the underlying concerns that remain , those involved in the talks seemed confident that both sides were on the right track .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said : " this is an important day ... we have concerns and an obligation to solve the problem and we can now move forward .
this agreement is opening a serious process to resolve the nuclear issue between iran and the international community . "
british foreign secretary jack straw made it clear that the iranians ' pledge of transparency must include clear definitions regarding its use of radioactive material .
" we all respect the rights of any sovereign nation to have a civil nuclear program but at the same time not to be involved in any proliferation activities , " he said .
the declaration was a successful end to what looked to be a " make or break " round of discussions .
fischer made statements earlier in the day which indicated the talks were on a knife edge : " if we can agree today , i think this will be an important step forward .
if not , we have a very serious problem . "

a suspect discovery following the discovery of traces of highly enriched uranium by iaea inspectors at an iranian nuclear facility earlier this year , the vienna-based organization passed a resolution demanding an explanation . it has also demanded that iran sign an additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty stating it will provide details on suspected attempts to redivert nuclear material to a weapons program . iran has maintained all along that its nuclear program is purely intended for civilian energy use . but the administration of u.s. president george w. bush , who included iran in his " axis of evil " along side iraq and north korea , has been pressuring the international community to take action against iran , which it suspects of developing nuclear weapons . following a meeting with bush last month , russian president vladimir putin said his country was willing to work together with iran to abandon any nuclear ambitions it had . friendly ties under strain traditionally friendly ties between germany and iran have been under tension recently as a result of the nuclear dispute .

a mass of the scottish pilgrimage to rome was held with less than four weeks ' notice it has been something of a mad scramble .
some of the scots have interrupted their october holidays and diverted to rome .
others had long-standing arrangements to visit the vatican to mark the pope 's 25th anniversary and now have another , unexpected , reason to celebrate .
the day before the consistory - the ceremony where the cardinals receive their red birettas , or caps - about 120 scots gathered just a few hundred yards from st peter 's square at the church of santa maria in traspontina for a mass .
archbishop keith o 'brien arrived wearing purple robes and was promptly swamped by well-wishers .
the archbishop shook hands and even cuddled a baby .
it was a great surprise when i was asked to stay a little longer archbishop keith o 'brien three-month-old johanna from mexico city had no idea why her mother felt it was so important for her to be given a blessing by the man in the brightly coloured clothes but she seemed more than happy to be nestled in the archbishop 's arms .
with most of the pilgrims inside the church , the mass should have been about to start .
but one small group still lingered outside .
" hurry up , " they were told .
" he wo n't start without you ! "
terry , helen and paul o 'brien - the brother , niece and nephew of the cardinal-elect - took the hint and quickly found their seats .
the delight at being appointed a cardinal was clear on the archbishop 's face , but so was the surprise at being chosen .
a piper helped greet archbishop o 'brien during the homily , he told the congregation that although he had planned to be in rome this week , he had not planned to stay this long .
" it was a great surprise when i was asked to stay a little longer , " he said .
" but if it was a surprise for me then i 'm sure it was a tremendous surprise for other people . "
after the mass , there were more handshakes and hugs and then just enough time for a final group photograph of close family and friends .
in the middle of the " team photograph " stood a beaming keith o 'brien .
it was probably one of the last pictures taken of him as an archbishop .

respectable people a spokeswoman for the company said : " we are renovating this building , which was in a disgusting state and our visitors will benefit the local economy .
" we are perfectly normal , respectable people who just happen to be swingers . "

" we are studying case law to see if there is anything we can do . "
durham police says it is making its own inquiries into the plan .

the merval index closed 2.8 % higher at 902.8 points , beating the previous high of 900.3 touched in june 1992 .
argentine stocks have gained more than 70 % this year , following the economic collapse of 2002 .
but some analysts watching argentina 's recovery are concerned that it has returned to the cycle of boom and bust .
although some domestic investors will have enjoyed the gains , many foreign investors will have lost out due to the devaluation of the peso in january 2002 .
the peso has gained about 18 % against the dollar so far this year , but is still 65 % lower than at the time of the devaluation .
recovery the argentine economy - notorious in recent years for disaster and deep recession - has been recovering this year .
the economy expanded by 6.6 % in the first half of the year and is forecast to grow at a even faster pace for the year as a whole .
investors were particularly cheered in september when president nestor kirchner reached an agreement with the international monetary fund for a vital new loan .
the deal means that argentina will only have to pay interest on a $ 21bn loan over the next three years , allowing it to concentrate on its economic recovery .
investors have also applauded the steady hand of president kirchner and his economy minister roberto lavagna since elections in april .
but there are concerns over the depth of the reforms being put in place , with some fearing that the changes are not going far enough to prevent another collapse .
menem era argentina has been prey to the boom and bust cycle before .
the boom of the early 1990s , presided over by carlos menem during his first term went horribly wrong during his second term .
chronic overspending forced argentina into the biggest ever debt default in late 2001 , when it pulled out of repayments on loans totalling $ 140bn .
the people have borne the brunt of the suffering inflicted by desperate economic measures , including the devaluation of the peso and despised controls on withdrawing their savings from the banks .
poverty is still rife as the people wait for the improvements to feed through to the ordinary argentines .

the boom of the early 1990s , presided over by carlos menem during his first term went horribly wrong during his second term .
chronic overspending forced argentina into the biggest ever debt default in late 2001 , when it pulled out of repayments on loans totalling $ 140bn .
the people have borne the brunt of the suffering inflicted by desperate economic measures , including the devaluation of the peso and despised controls on withdrawing their savings from the banks .
poverty is still rife as the people wait for the improvements to feed through to the ordinary argentines .

this year , us concerns over north korea and the continued threat of terrorism in south east asia have dominated a forum which was established 14 years ago to promote free trade .
apec 's earliest goals were actually very modest .
it was an initiative of the then australian prime minister bob hawk , backed by his east asian neighbours who were concerned that their region 's fast-growing economies would be disadvantaged by the emergence of free trade blocks like the european union and the north american free trade area .
at the first meeting , in 1989 , members stressed that their discussions should be consultative and non-binding and should recognise their very different social and political systems .
it was only in 1993 that president clinton proposed the lofty goal of an asia pacific free trade area with his now famous proclamation that this would be the pacific century .
but from the start , the annual summits were easily sidetracked by non-economic issues .
the 1994 meeting in indonesia was dominated by east timorese protestors sheltering in the us embassy .
meltdown the crisis in east timor once again overshadowed the summit in auckland in 1999 .
in shanghai in 2001 , as george bush made his first overseas trip following the attacks on september the 11th , all talk was about terrorism .
in any case , the self confidence of the region which had once given it a sense of purpose was badly shaken by the asian economic meltdown of 1997 .
these days important trade decisions in the region are left to the world trade organisation whose agreements are at least binding .
a growing number of asia pacific countries are making bilateral trade deals with each other because multilateral free trade is so slow in coming .
so is there any point to apec ?
it is still the only forum in which leaders of such key economies as japan , the united states and china can get together in a relaxed setting and discuss anything that is on their minds .
it is worth remembering too that apec 's members account for half of all global economic activity and that they are all believers in globalisation and free trade .
if apec did not exist they would probably have to invent something very like it .

this year , us concerns over north korea and the continued threat of terrorism in south east asia have dominated a forum which was established 14 years ago to promote free trade .
apec 's earliest goals were actually very modest .
it was an initiative of the then australian prime minister bob hawk , backed by his east asian neighbours who were concerned that their region 's fast-growing economies would be disadvantaged by the emergence of free trade blocks like the european union and the north american free trade area .
at the first meeting , in 1989 , members stressed that their discussions should be consultative and non-binding and should recognise their very different social and political systems .
it was only in 1993 that president clinton proposed the lofty goal of an asia pacific free trade area with his now famous proclamation that this would be the pacific century .
but from the start , the annual summits were easily sidetracked by non-economic issues .
the 1994 meeting in indonesia was dominated by east timorese protestors sheltering in the us embassy .
meltdown the crisis in east timor once again overshadowed the summit in auckland in 1999 .
in shanghai in 2001 , as george bush made his first overseas trip following the attacks on september the 11th , all talk was about terrorism .
in any case , the self confidence of the region which had once given it a sense of purpose was badly shaken by the asian economic meltdown of 1997 .
these days important trade decisions in the region are left to the world trade organisation whose agreements are at least binding .
a growing number of asia pacific countries are making bilateral trade deals with each other because multilateral free trade is so slow in coming .
so is there any point to apec ?
it is still the only forum in which leaders of such key economies as japan , the united states and china can get together in a relaxed setting and discuss anything that is on their minds .
it is worth remembering too that apec 's members account for half of all global economic activity and that they are all believers in globalisation and free trade .
if apec did not exist they would probably have to invent something very like it .

but the plymouth city council has said florence seccombe , who was in her 70s , had never complained about intimidation and had lived a nomadic lifestyle for sometime .
ms seccombe died after being stabbed in the neck at plymouth 's bretonside bus station at about 0600 bst on saturday .
her friends and neighbours say she was afraid to return to her home in the city 's prince rock area because she had been victimised by a local gang and had instead been sleeping rough at the bus station .
it is a very callous and calculated incident detective chief inspector andrew boulting neighbour ida stoneman , 82 , said : " the lads around here were constantly bothering her .
" they would smash her windows and call her names .
they really picked on her .
" she was too scared to stay in that flat . "
chief superintendent john isaac said on monday her home on harvey avenue was run-down and boarded up .
" all of that indicates some trauma in her life .
it would be wrong to suggest what those problems might be , " he said .
' chaotic lifestyle ' in a statement plymouth city council described her death as " tragic " .
the authority says she was known to social services and had a long history of living a " somewhat chaotic and nomadic lifestyle " .
the council says she had never complained to the council about any intimidation and had not asked to be moved from her prince rock home .
the authority says it will work with the police to tackle any anti-social behaviour in the prince rock area .
the statement said the council would also be reviewing its files to see if anything else could have been done to help her .
cctv footage around the bus station is being reviewed and officers are asking for anyone with information to come forward .
her body was found next to a cream-coloured duvet she had used for several months as she slept at the bus depot .
motiveless attack there is no evidence she was robbed or beaten up .
senior investigating officer detective chief inspector andrew boulting , said : " it is also a very callous and calculated incident which we are dealing with in a very serious manner . "
the bus station was sealed off over the weekend while forensic investigations were carried out .
police are still searching for the murder weapon , thought to be a sharp , bladed instrument .
part of bretonside bus station remains cordoned off while further investigations take place .
officers are appealing for local residents and businesses with cctv footage of the area to come forward .
the bus station 's own cctv system is in " desperate need of an overhaul and upgrade " , mr isaac said .
florence seccombe is described as a frail five-feet tall woman in her 70s .
she was wearing a black hooded coat , a black knee-length skirt , knee-length socks , a red roll-neck jumper and a blue and purple long-sleeved sweatshirt .
police are appealing for anyone who was in bretonside bus station between 2000 bst on 17 october and 0600 bst on 18 october to come forward .
