german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 27.02.2003 germany falling behind in the technology race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's getting harder to fill these jobs in germany .
insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .
they accuse past german politicians of shortsightedness in attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for education . " those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .
the so-called pisa survey conducted by the oecd in 2000 comparing educational systems around the world revealed that german pride in its schools was misplaced .
secondary students in the " land of poets and thinkers " ranked only 21st in reading literacy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 german joins ' human shields ' movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' human shields ' activists want to prevent bombs from dropping on iraqis .
as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .

merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .

british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .

u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 german joins ' human shields ' movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' human shields ' activists want to prevent bombs from dropping on iraqis .
as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .
they accuse past german politicians of shortsightedness in attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for education . " those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .
the so-called pisa survey conducted by the oecd in 2000 comparing educational systems around the world revealed that german pride in its schools was misplaced .
secondary students in the " land of poets and thinkers " ranked only 21st in reading literacy .
in mathematics and science , they fared only slightly better , 20th place .
the pisa results shocked the nation and left politicians scrambling to come up with plans for revamping a system that has drifted into mediocrity . although everyone agrees that something has to be done , opinions differ on what kind of reforms to put in place .
the schröder administration has promised to expand the network of all-day schools across the country , which would have see students spending more hours in the classroom .
but that idea has met with opposition from some christian democrats and has been dragged down over funding questions . one bright spot in the technology report was germany 's automobile industry , which the report said remains a driver of automotive innovation the world over .
however , researcher harald legler warned against an overdependence on this traditional industry , no matter how strong it is .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .

" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .

in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .

wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .

in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .
in 2000 , they got the starbucks coffee chain to sell fair trade certified coffee at least once a month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing out in the coffee boom starbucks ' chances in germany look bright , according to the country 's coffee experts .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .
in 2000 , they got the starbucks coffee chain to sell fair trade certified coffee at least once a month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing out in the coffee boom starbucks ' chances in germany look bright , according to the country 's coffee experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 german joins ' human shields ' movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' human shields ' activists want to prevent bombs from dropping on iraqis .
as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 german joins ' human shields ' movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' human shields ' activists want to prevent bombs from dropping on iraqis .
as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .

following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water .

" we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .
they accuse past german politicians of shortsightedness in attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for education . " those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .
the so-called pisa survey conducted by the oecd in 2000 comparing educational systems around the world revealed that german pride in its schools was misplaced .
secondary students in the " land of poets and thinkers " ranked only 21st in reading literacy .
in mathematics and science , they fared only slightly better , 20th place .
the pisa results shocked the nation and left politicians scrambling to come up with plans for revamping a system that has drifted into mediocrity . although everyone agrees that something has to be done , opinions differ on what kind of reforms to put in place .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .

" those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .

" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 german joins ' human shields ' movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' human shields ' activists want to prevent bombs from dropping on iraqis .
as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .
they accuse past german politicians of shortsightedness in attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for education . " those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .
the so-called pisa survey conducted by the oecd in 2000 comparing educational systems around the world revealed that german pride in its schools was misplaced .
secondary students in the " land of poets and thinkers " ranked only 21st in reading literacy .
in mathematics and science , they fared only slightly better , 20th place .
the pisa results shocked the nation and left politicians scrambling to come up with plans for revamping a system that has drifted into mediocrity . although everyone agrees that something has to be done , opinions differ on what kind of reforms to put in place .
the schröder administration has promised to expand the network of all-day schools across the country , which would have see students spending more hours in the classroom .
but that idea has met with opposition from some christian democrats and has been dragged down over funding questions . one bright spot in the technology report was germany 's automobile industry , which the report said remains a driver of automotive innovation the world over .
however , researcher harald legler warned against an overdependence on this traditional industry , no matter how strong it is .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey could offer valuable launching pad for u.s. forces u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee .

hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .
in 2000 , they got the starbucks coffee chain to sell fair trade certified coffee at least once a month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing out in the coffee boom starbucks ' chances in germany look bright , according to the country 's coffee experts .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .
" we have to pay for everything , the flight , transport .
and if things go wrong , we may have to pay with our lives .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .

u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .

it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

coffee , chocolate and clothes fairly produced by third-world producers will get special billing in 13 european countries . germany has always been proud of its third world-friendly , eco-conscious stance among the world 's developed nations . so it was no surprise when a total of three government ministers were on hand on wednesday to present the official fair trade seal that will adorn third world products in european stores in the coming years . the seal indicates the product , ranging from coffee to orange juice , was produced under humane conditions by laborers compensated fairly for their work .
transfair products are already available in 22,000 german stores , including supermarket chains .
" those who buy this product , quite practically express solidarity with people in developing countries , " said economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who was joined by consumer protection and agricultural minister renate künast and environmental minister jürgen trittin at the seal 's presentation . tough requirements for certification the seal , already well-known in the united states , will appear in stores in 13 european countries .
around 3 million consumers in germany buy transfair , according to statistics from the non-profit 's german headquarters .
to ensure its products are produced in good conditions , the group works together with the fair trade federation , which lays down a list of stringent criteria third-world farmers must fulfil .
coffee producers , for example , must belong to transparent cooperatives or organizations that guarantee their field laborers a good wage . in exchange the producers are guaranteed credit should they need it and that they will receive a minimum of $ 1.26 -lrb- € 1.16 -rrb- per pound of coffee . " if you want to examine the dimensions of this : the amount one coffee-grower , working under intense competitive conditions , receives for one kilo of coffee , is significantly less than what we pay for an espresso in a restaurant , " said trittin . small signs of success transfair , is part of a federation of 17 fair trade certified organizations in north america , europe and japan . though the movement has made progress and gained international attention in recent years , it has yet to have a significant effect on the makeup of world trade . fair trade coffee , the most widely-distributed product , still makes up only 1 percent of the worldwide coffee trade . the organizations have celebrated small successes .
in 2000 , they got the starbucks coffee chain to sell fair trade certified coffee at least once a month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losing out in the coffee boom starbucks ' chances in germany look bright , according to the country 's coffee experts .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
the memorandum won immediate backing from china , despite secretary of state colin powell 's lobbying efforts with top officials in beijing this week.france is a permanent member of the security council and could veto the u.s. resolution .
germany is a temporary member of the council and holds its presidency this month .
schröder planned to continue his efforts on wednesday , flying to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin .
german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .
" and i view a second u.n. resolution exactly in the context of increasing the threat of violence and the military might confronting saddam hussein . "
in a bid to win support from war-wary council members , the draft resolution does n't explicitly call for an authorization of war , though u.s. and british diplomats say it is implicit .
instead , the resolution - acting under a section of the u.n. charter that makes resolutions militarily enforceable - recalls the tough language that the council agreed to when it passed resolution 1441 three months ago .
the new draft also recalls that 1441 already found that " iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations , " and notes that iraq 's 12,000-page declaration to u.n. weapons inspectors in december contained " false statements and omissions . "
saddam expresses resistance to demand the resolution and the response from germany , france and russia were filed as a deadline neared on a related issue that could give the united states a reason to invade iraq .
saddam has until saturday to begin destroying all of the country 's al samoud 2 missiles , which chief u.n. weapons inspector hans blix says go beyond the range limit set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
but in an interview with cbs anchor dan rather to be aired wednesday , saddam indicated that he did not intend to destroy the missiles .
cbs quoted saddam as saying : " iraq is allowed to prepare proper missiles , and we are committed to that .

on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .
germans , french talk strategy shortly after that announcement was made , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac met in a berlin restaurant called " the court of final appeal " to discuss their latest effort in the world 's highest-ranking court of appeal to block a u.s.-led effort to invade iraq .
after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .
as part of this diplomatic resistance , germany , france and russia have introduced their own u.n. proposal designed to achieve the peaceful disarmament of iraq by extending the inspectors ' stay .
leaders condemn war standing on a small podium outside the restaurant , schröder and chirac spelled out their reasons for stiffening their opposition to the resolution introduced by the united states , britain and spain on monday .
" perhaps one of the differences between old europe and others is that the european people know deep in their collective conscience what war actually means , " schröder said , making a passing reference to criticism raised by u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
" and because of this awareness , you can better understand what binds the french and germans in the hope , expectation and fight to disarm iraq in a peaceful fashion . "
chirac acknowledged that iraq posed a danger to the middle east and perhaps to the world .
" but the disarmament of iraq must be carried out peacefully , " chirac said .
" war is in moral , human , economic and political terms the worst of all solutions . "
under the plan presented by germany , france and russia , inspections would extend beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .

german opposition leader backs bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the opposing plans were being introduced in the united nations on the same day that angela merkel , the chairwoman of germany 's biggest opposition party , was being warmly welcomed in washington by leaders of the bush administration who have been snubbing schröder because of his opposition to their iraq plans .
merkel , who leads the christian democratic union , met with vice president dick cheney , rumsfeld and security adviser condoleezza rice .
unlike schröder , merkel said she stood behind the bush administration 's latest resolution .
" the military threat -lrb- against iraq -rrb- must continue to be increased , " merkel said at a news conference .

british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .
last year , he came across the international group " voices in the wilderness , " which hand-delivers medical supplies , journals and toys to children 's hospitals in iraq despite the economic sanctions . hanel then sought to find a way to support the iraqi population : after researching and reading intensively about the country , he founded a small action group in the university town of tübingen in southern germany , with which he smuggled medicine to a hospital in basra , iraq . e-mails to the chancellor in january , he traveled to iraq for the first time , together with german singer konstantin wecker .
following the trip , hanel was stuck in amman , jordan , for more than three weeks , waiting for a visa to travel back to iraq . in the meantime , he has written e-mails to german chancellor gerhard schröder , foreign minister joschka fischer and german president johannes rau telling them about his experiences in iraq . both in amman and at home he spent much time thinking about the meaning of the human shield mission to iraq .
" of course there are fears and one thinks a lot about what could happen , " he says .
however , he says it is reassuring to know where the next bomb shelter is , or if one has the right tablets to disinfect water . " and he is well aware that many may accuse him of working for the iraqi government , especially as the human shields are featured regularly on iraqi television and have ongoing contact with high-ranking members of the iraqi government . " we from the peace movement are always asked about this , even though we are only in iraq in support of the iraqi population .
but what about the many construction companies or a corporation like daimlerchrysler , or the many building firms that are active in iraq and have offices there - why are they never questioned ? " but hanel says the human shields are not in iraq to do business .
he says all they want to do is to protect the normal people of iraq .

as the " human shields " movement catches on across the world , german peace activist jürgen hanel has left for baghdad to join a group which hopes to avert a war just by its sheer - western - presence . while more than half of the german population has come to terms with the idea that there will be a war in iraq , 40 percent still believe there is a chance for a peaceful solution to the conflict . one is jürgen hanel , who has left germany together with 40 other peace activists from across the world , to act as a so-called " human shield " in iraq .
hanel hopes that because of the sheer presence of the human shields , the united states will refrain from dropping bombs on iraq . but if it does come to war and a u.s.-led military attack kills western civilians , he hopes it will lead to major protests around the world . " our aim is clear : we want to avoid a war and make our mark " - even if the situation escalates , he says .
" in the worst case , bombs will fall on our heads , too , but the most important thing is still the 25 million people in iraq . " the potential human shields have caught the eye of u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
on wednesday , he warned people from joining their ranks because the united states could not guarantee their safety .
a pentagon official also suggested that people serving as human shields could be viewed as fighters for iraq .
" i am no legal expert , " the official said .
" but you could argue that these people have decided to serve the government of iraq and thus have crossed the line between being a civilian and being a fighter . " breaking economic sanctions with his tousled , dirty-blond hair , friendly brown face and slight figure , hanel does n't quite fit the dangerous mission he has dedicated his life to .
even his thick checked shirt seems just a size too big for the 40-year-old .
in germany , hanel works as an odd job man , sometimes as a truck driver , at others as a decorator . for hanel , there are more important things than earning money .
he is a dedicated member of the anti-nuclear movement and has repeatedly taken to the streets in anti-globalization protests .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .

after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , the russian president rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix . blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
in response to a new u.s.-sponsored resolution that says baghdad has missed a " final opportunity " to disarm peacefully , germany , france and russia have presented an alternative plan that calls for u.n. weapons inspections to be extended beyond july 1 , when the summer heat would make fighting more difficult .
russians , french protest despite russia 's public opposition to the united states , its criticism remains somewhat restrained .
among putin 's aides , this position is described as active diplomacy and passive support of the united states .
this position also was reflected in a recent article that appeared in the newspaper izvestia .
" we ca n't stop the war .
but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .

but we will be able to have a say when iraq is divided up , " the article said .
such a say would be important for russia 's oil business .
russia is the world 's third biggest oil producer behind saudi arabia and the united states , pumping out nearly 6 million barrels a day .
an iraq that was no longer ruled by saddam hussein eventually could begin to heavily tap into the country 's oil reserves , the second largest in the world .
such a change would turn iraq from a minor producer of about 2 million barrels a day that is hamstrung by u.n. sanctions into a major player on the international market again .
such a heavy producer could help drive down international prices .
for russia , whose government depends on oil revenues , a price below $ 20 a barrel could cause severe pain .
today , those prices are around $ 36 a barrel .
russia also has its own economic ties to iraq to think about .
five russian companies already have bought oil production rights from iraq , according to the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
iraq , as the soviet union 's best weapons customer in the region , also owes russia $ 8 billion .
russian officials fear that the overthrow of saddam would endanger the drilling deals and the repayment of debts , the newspaper reported .
chancellor presses his efforts schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month .
the diplomatic discussion is being carried out amid continued military preparations .
the north atlantic treaty organization sent two airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft from germany to turkey on wednesday as part of the alliance 's military aid to its only member that borders iraq .
about 30 german service members are among the 100-member group sent to konya , turkey .
in addition , about 360 dutch troops will be deployed at the turkish bases of batman and diyarbakir to man patriot air-defense missiles provided by germany .
the aid , like the u.s. military pressure on iraq , caused a split in the alliance .
germany , france and belgium objected this month to a u.s. request to begin planning the mission .
it took the alliance 's leadership a week to work out a compromise on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer the alliance also has asked its 19 members to report by friday on additional aid they are willing to provide to the turkish government .
german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear in a television interview on wednesday night that germany would not go beyond the awacs crew members and the patriot missiles .
" our view is that this is sufficient for defensive purposes , " fischer said of the patriots .
u.s. awaits turkish decision in washington , u.s. leaders are continuing to wait impatiently for turkish approval of a separate military proposal - the right for the united states to station up to 62,000 troops in the country .
the u.s. military wants to use the troops to open a northern front against iraq , creating extra pressure on saddam 's forces and seizing iraqi oil fields in the region .
in return the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the proposal still has to be approved by the turkish parliament .
the vote was expected to be taken thursday , but was put off in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
" a rejection would put our country and our people in a difficult position , " the turkish news agency anatolia quoted a leading member of the government as saying .
turkey also pulled out its ambassador from baghdad on wednesday .
turkish officials blamed increasing pressure from iraq for the decision , not a growing likelihood of war .

insufficient investment in education and research threatens germany 's high-tech standing in the world as fewer opt for degrees in the sciences .
the technology slump could have long-term economic ramifications . once germany was a leading light in terms of technology , turning out innovative products and enjoying an unrivalled reputation for manufacturing products .
but according to a report by one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , the country has squandered its one-time lead and is in danger of losing out to other countries which have invested more heavily in their high-tech future . " germany 's foundation has been solidly built , but some highly visible cracks have developed , " said harald legler , researcher at the lower saxony institute of economic research , which carried out the study for the german government .
" those who want to produce high-quality products need highly qualified graduates , " he said . the 200-page study shows that the edge germany 's educational system enjoyed over other countries up until the 1980s is largely gone .
training opportunities for young people in technical fields have declined some 30 to 40 percent since 1990 . the number of students completing higher educational degree programs in the natural or engineering sciences is also dropping .
only seven german students in 1,000 complete a science degree program compared with the 10 to 15 percent of students who do so in other industrialized countries .
the report also found that only a third of young germans plan to pursue a university education , compared to an average of 45 percent in other western countries . " all of this taken together does n't look very good for germany 's future technological productivity , " said legler .
" in the foreseeable future we are going to experience a shortage of new people entering these fields . " shortsighted outlook the loss of high educational standards and interest , in technological fields , could have serious consequences for germany .
according to the study 's authors , the support of education and research is crucial for the country 's economic future .
they accuse past german politicians of shortsightedness in attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for education . " those who want to do a good business in five years have to spend money now on development , " education minister edelgard bulmahn told reporters at a press conference on wednesday and laid the blame for the high-tech slowdown on previous administrations .
she promised to fight for higher federal investment in high-tech education .
the schröder administration has raised the budget for education and research by 25 percent since 1998 . " the future of germany 's technological productivity will be decided in our schools and universities , " bulmahn said . another blow for education the latest blow to the german education system comes as the country is already wringing its hands over another exposure of shortcomings in its once-lauded education system .
the so-called pisa survey conducted by the oecd in 2000 comparing educational systems around the world revealed that german pride in its schools was misplaced .
secondary students in the " land of poets and thinkers " ranked only 21st in reading literacy .
in mathematics and science , they fared only slightly better , 20th place .
the pisa results shocked the nation and left politicians scrambling to come up with plans for revamping a system that has drifted into mediocrity . although everyone agrees that something has to be done , opinions differ on what kind of reforms to put in place .
the schröder administration has promised to expand the network of all-day schools across the country , which would have see students spending more hours in the classroom .
but that idea has met with opposition from some christian democrats and has been dragged down over funding questions . one bright spot in the technology report was germany 's automobile industry , which the report said remains a driver of automotive innovation the world over .
however , researcher harald legler warned against an overdependence on this traditional industry , no matter how strong it is . " you ca n't stand on just one leg , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany searching for education solutions an international test that german students took in 2000 forced officials to begin asking difficult questions about the country 's education system .

chancellor schröder has promised more money for schools .
he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .
the diplomatic maneuvers focus on the u.n. security council .
france and russia hold veto power in the council .
germany , a non-permanent member , holds the rotating presidency this month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey could offer valuable launching pad for u.s. forces u.s. military planners want to push across turkey 's border with iraq if president george w. bush orders an invasion .
such a location could help save lives and iraq 's oil fields , analysts say .

german leaders think they have provided their nato partner of turkey with enough military aid to defend itself from iraq .
america , meanwhile , awaits a turkish go-ahead on deployment of u.s. troops in the north . nato 's military headquarters has given its 19 alliance members until friday to come up with concrete plans on the sort of military support they are willing to provide to turkey if the alliance member is attacked by iraq during a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein .
but as early as wednesday night , german foreign minister joschka fischer let germany 's alliance partners know during a television interview that his government would not go beyond its current contribution - 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for air surveillance planes .
on thursday , defense minister peter struck seconded fischer 's statement .
" i think we have done enough for turkey , " struck said .
aid granted after dispute germany grudgingly provided the missiles and crew members after putting up a fight this month with france and belgium against a u.s. request to begin planning for military support to turkey , the only nato member to border iraq .
the three countries ' vetoes triggered one of the worst crises in the alliance 's 53-year history .
after a week of negotiations , nato secretary general george robertson solved the conflict by using an organizational tactic that took the french out of the decision-making process and had the alliance pledge to support the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict with iraq peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck germany still has around 30 patriot systems .
in response to the question why the country 's military needs to keep all of the systems in germany , struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " i did n't say we needed all of the patriots .
i just said we have done enough for turkey . "
in washington , the situation is reversed .
leaders in the u.s. capital continue to await a turkish green signal to give them permission to send in a force of 62,000 service members who could invade iraq from the north .
u.s. officials had hoped that they would get permission from the turkish parliament on thursday .
but the vote was put off until saturday in order to give the government more time to discuss the proposal with the opposition .
the issue is difficult for parliamentarians for several reasons .
most turks oppose any war against iraq .
at the same time , parliamentary refusal could create major political problems for turkey , which has received u.s. support in its effort to join the european union .
u.s. to pay up to $ 30 billion in exchange for the stationing rights , the united states has agreed during long negotiations to provide turkey with up to $ 30 billion in aid to offset any economic losses caused by a war .
the delay came a day after german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed ahead in his effort to block a war against iraq by traveling to moscow to meet another opponent of the american drive , russian president vladimir putin .
after talks with schöder at the kremlin late wednesday , putin emphasized the need for a peaceful solution .
" we must work further on a peaceful solution and make use of all diplomatic means , " he said .
putin said he thought that all of the possibilities that u.n. resolution 1441 held on the disarming of iraq were " far from spent . "
at the same time , he rejected a u.s.-led draft resolution that foresees a swift military strike against iraq .
" for us , no resolution that automatically contains the right to use force is acceptable , " he said .
chancellor backs inspections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder likewise , schröder said he was convinced there was still room for a peaceful resolution .
" baghdad must allow the continuation of inspections without any delay and must fulfill all requirements , " he said .
the chancellor also underscored the common stance favored by germany and russia on iraq .
" germany and russia know from their own tortured experience what war means .
and that 's why the high level of agreement is moving , " he said .
wednesday 's round of talks between schröder and putin was the latest move in their effort to prevent a war .
it came as leaders wait to see whether iraq begins to destroy mid-range al samoud 2 missiles by saturday as ordered by the u.n. chief weapons inspector , hans blix .
blix says the missiles ' range goes beyond the limit of 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- set by the security council in resolutions adopted after the 1991 persian gulf war .
schröder 's visit to moscow is one of a series of meetings he has held in his drive to prevent a war .
he last met with putin two weeks ago in berlin and talked with french president jacques chirac on monday evening in the german capital .
by contrast , he last talked to u.s. president george w. bush by telephone sometime in november or december , a schröder spokesman said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.02.2003 blair calls german , french effort absurd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair : " this is not a road to peace . "
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .
later on tuesday , blair met with german foreign minister joschka fischer , another european supporter of further inspections . afterward , fischer said the two countries were unable to end their differences of opinion .
the meeting was one of many diplomatic efforts being held on the day after the united states , britain and spain announced that they would file a second resolution in the u.n. security council that declares that iraq has missed its chance to peacefully disarm .

after completing their meal of pork and sauerkraut , schröder and chirac stepped before a crowd of journalists gathered outside the 382-year-old restaurant to let bush and blair know that they planned to build a new line of defense against their efforts .

"
british prime minister tony blair says german and french efforts to extend inspections in iraq will only serve to prolong a war and increase bloodshed . the speech on tuesday was considered to be one of the most important ones that british prime minister tony blair has delivered since he took office in 1997 .
and he made clear what he thought of the new european attempts to extend the mission of u.n. inspectors in iraq .
the idea is absurd , blair told the assembled members of parliament .
" this is not a road to peace , but folly and weakness which will only mean that when the conflict comes , it will be more bloody , less certain and greater in its devastation , " blair said .
the speech comes at a crucial time for the prime minister , an unwavering supporter of president george w. bush and his drive to wage war against iraq in an effort to disarm the regime of saddam hussein .
on wednesday , members of the british parliament will debate a government motion that tells saddam that he has his " final opportunity " to get rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
anti-war critics told the british broadcasting corp. that at least 80 mps will rebel against the government 's hard-line stance when the parliament votes .

the sought-after pearls have been found in highland rivers for hundreds of years .
scotland is home to half the world 's population of the rare mussels which produce the pearls .

the rivers where the pearl mussels still survive are being kept secret to try to protect them .

" we were trying to look at the state of the pearl mussels to try to compare that with as far back in historical documents that we could go , " he said .
" we are mainly interested in the decline in the last 100 years because records become more detailed and we assume that stocks in victorian times were still relatively healthy .
