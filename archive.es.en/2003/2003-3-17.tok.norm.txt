but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .

the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .

" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .
even if schröder reaches this goal , 81 percent of germans said in a survey that they were not sure the reforms would have much effect . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats uneasy with chancellor 's course as unemployment rises , members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government are letting him know they are worried about his political course .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.03.2003 schröder faces internal opposition to reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new course for germany : chancellor gerhard schröder wants to cut jobless aid as part of his reform plans .
members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .
even if schröder reaches this goal , 81 percent of germans said in a survey that they were not sure the reforms would have much effect . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german social democrats uneasy with chancellor 's course as unemployment rises , members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government are letting him know they are worried about his political course .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .

recently nato surveillance aircraft have been flying missions to protect turkey from a possible threat from iraq .
deutsche welle flew along on a flight to the konya air base in central turkey . war with iraq may be only days away , but there was little tension on our awacs flight to konya .
with candy bars , fresh fruit and coca-cola available , the passengers on the three-and-a-half hour flight from germany to turkey were in a good mood . make no mistake , this was no lufthansa vacation flight . the awacs , which stands for airborne warning and control system , is a modified boeing 707 , chock-full of state-of-the-art surveillance equipment .
instantly recognizable with its black rotating radar dome , it is considered the world ’ s best air battle command and control aircraft . used during the last gulf war in 1991 and during the nato air war over kosovo in 1999 , the awacs planes are on a strictly defensive mission this time around .
the planes are patrolling turkey 's border with iraq to provide an early warning for a possible attack from iraq . still , the planes ' deployment to turkey was controversial . a mission dogged by critics france , germany and belgium originally blocked nato planning to increase turkey 's defenses for several weeks last month .
they feared the measures would be the equivalent of planning for war and would undermine united nations efforts to avert a war in iraq . after a few unpleasant days of diplomatic haggling at nato headquarters in brussels , the alliance eventually approved a u.s. request for the awacs in mid-february . nato has 17 such planes at its base in geilenkirchen , not far from germany ’ s border with the netherlands .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .
" we will do everything possible to stop them during the legislative process .
if necessary , we can not rule out going to court , " said sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
but the chancellor seemed to be unimpressed by such criticism in a television interview he gave on sunday evening .
" it must be finally possible to start something like this in germany , to push it through , " he said .
party leadership backs plans the chancellor took a first step on monday toward winning approval .
the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .
scholz said the aim was to have the changes on the books by summer .

deutsche welle flew along on a flight to the konya air base in central turkey . war with iraq may be only days away , but there was little tension on our awacs flight to konya .
with candy bars , fresh fruit and coca-cola available , the passengers on the three-and-a-half hour flight from germany to turkey were in a good mood . make no mistake , this was no lufthansa vacation flight . the awacs , which stands for airborne warning and control system , is a modified boeing 707 , chock-full of state-of-the-art surveillance equipment .

with candy bars , fresh fruit and coca-cola available , the passengers on the three-and-a-half hour flight from germany to turkey were in a good mood . make no mistake , this was no lufthansa vacation flight . the awacs , which stands for airborne warning and control system , is a modified boeing 707 , chock-full of state-of-the-art surveillance equipment .
instantly recognizable with its black rotating radar dome , it is considered the world ’ s best air battle command and control aircraft . used during the last gulf war in 1991 and during the nato air war over kosovo in 1999 , the awacs planes are on a strictly defensive mission this time around .
the planes are patrolling turkey 's border with iraq to provide an early warning for a possible attack from iraq . still , the planes ' deployment to turkey was controversial . a mission dogged by critics france , germany and belgium originally blocked nato planning to increase turkey 's defenses for several weeks last month .
they feared the measures would be the equivalent of planning for war and would undermine united nations efforts to avert a war in iraq . after a few unpleasant days of diplomatic haggling at nato headquarters in brussels , the alliance eventually approved a u.s. request for the awacs in mid-february . nato has 17 such planes at its base in geilenkirchen , not far from germany ’ s border with the netherlands .
the awacs fleet and about 1,800 airmen fall under the command of german gen. johann dora , who joined the flight to visit the 70 pilots , radar specialists and aircrew members stationed in konya . dora , who has racked up 3,000 awacs flight hours , explained the integral role the planes have come to play since entering nato service in 1982 .
“ the awacs can take over a number of offensive and defensive tasks , making them crucial for coordinating modern air warfare , ” dora said . on the ground in konya , two planes stood ready on the tarmac under clear blue skies while a third patrolled near the iraqi border , which is a two-hour flight away from the base .
“ up till now the awacs have observed parts of both iraqi and turkish airspace , ” dora said .
“ we can ’ t give exact details , but the turks have been very positive about our support . ” club med at the crossroads the base itself has long been used for nato training purposes and offers the airmen and soldiers stationed there as many of the amenities of home as possible .
lodged in attractive green wood cabins , they have access to a well-equipped gym , billiards and table-tennis and even a sauna .
the mess hall cook from geilenkirchen serves german specialties as well as other favorites such as steak . one of the other visiting journalists compared the camp to tour operator club med , but the constant roar of jet engines made it abundantly clear no one has come to konya for vacation . as gianfranco , an italian air traffic controller who gave only his first name , explained : “ when nato says it ’ s your job to protect turkey , then i do my duty . ” up until now that duty has been training and waiting .
with gianfranco ’ s two-week-long shift in konya over , he was set to fly back to geilenkirchen with us .

and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .

the party 's leadership committee unanimously endorsed the concept , scholz said .
over the next few weeks , schröder will turn his attention to winning over the party 's rank and file in a series of four regional conferences .

members of the social democrats ' left wing are vowing to launch a battle in parliament against chancellor gerhard schröder 's plan to revive the economy .
but schröder seems unimpressed by the criticism . olaf scholz , a politician by trade , chose the words of a surgeon on monday to describe the conflicts simmering within the social democratic party over chancellor gerhard schröder 's proposed reforms that include cuts in unemployment and health benefits .
it will be " no easy operation , " said scholz , the party 's general secretary .
the operation focuses on winning party support for the plans that schröder announced on friday in his attempt to resuscitate an economy that is lingering on the edge of recession , that has produced a legion of 4.7 million unemployed people and is suffering under the weight of constantly climbing premiums for the national healthcare system .
cuts in jobless , health benefits during his address to the national parliament in berlin , the social democratic chancellor proposed to cut jobless benefits for people younger than 55 to a maximum of 12 months instead of the current 32 months and for people 55 and older to a maximum of 18 months .
turning to the national health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work .
the change is designed to save insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
the proposals produced an outcry from members of the social democrats ' left wing and from some of the country 's labor union .
fight in parliament pledged one of the parliamentary leaders of this wing alluded on monday to the fight ahead .
" you have to know that we as parliamentarians have to ensure that this program is balanced , " michael müller said .
" i think the question of who votes for the program will depend on whether we are successful . "
müller made the comment after other members of the left wing expressed barbed criticism .
to andrea nahles , a former parliamentarian who leads the group democratic left , the proposals reflect the government 's surrender bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer to " a barrage of laissez-fair artillery fire . "
and to michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation , the proposals represent " a clear break " of election campaign promises .

all 84 seats in el salvador 's congress and 262 mayoral seats nationwide are being contested in the fifth election since a ceasefire ended a 12-year civil war in 1992 .
the farabundo marti national liberation front -lrb- fmln -rrb- said it had won 100 mayorships , and was gaining ground on the right-wing nationalist republican alliance -lrb- arena -rrb- in the congressional races .
arena has conceded the city hall in the capital san salvador , but said it had done better in the rest of the country .
turnout was low , with only about 40 % of the electorate casting their ballots .
projections the fmln 's candidate in san salvador , carlos rivas zamora , said late on sunday that " our lead is clear enough to claim that we have won " , although no official results have yet been released .
arena party leader archie baldocchie said that , whatever its success in the capital , the fmln had misread the rest of the country .
unofficial projections estimate that arena will maintain its 29 seats in congress , while the fmln could increase from 25 to 31 .
either party would need to enter into a coalition with smaller parties to gain a majority .
voting irregularities voting was reportedly largely peaceful , but there were some irregularities .
some polling stations opened late , and while some voters names had been left off the electoral register , deceased voters were still on the list .
" what a disgrace , " said salvadorian maria elba vaquerano .
" i asked and they told me i was supposed to vote here , and now that i try they tell me my name is not there and that i ca n't vote . "
in the run-up to the election several political activists were shot dead .
the sale of alcohol was banned for three days starting from saturday morning .
anyone caught drinking alcohol or selling it faces a fine of $ 114 .

seaweed is commonly used a fertiliser on the western isles .
fears have grown since radioactive material which is thought to have come from the sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in cumbria was found in the water around norway .
scandinavia shares the same tidal chain with scotland 's west coast islands .
tidal chain fears over the cancer-causing chemical technetium 99 have also been expressed by farmers on the east coast of ireland .
the western isles council now wants the scottish environment protection agency to carry out comprehensive tests to reassure the public .
they are calling for tests as soon as possible on water and on the seaweed that is being used on crops such as potatoes .
angus nicholson , chairman of the western isles environmental services committee , said : " we are particularly worried about the cumulative affect of contaminated seaweed being used on vegetable plots over many years .
" we want to carry out these tests to put everybody 's mind at rest . "
technetium-99 is known to be a by-product of reprocessing nuclear fuel rods and sellafield is the most likely source of the contamination .
once in the human body , technetium-99 accumulates in the thyroid gland and intestinal tract and greatly increases the risk of cancer .
