june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .
historians hope the same fate can be avoided for june 17 , which represented an important milestone in the restoration of democracy in the communist east . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 55 years of gdr uprising on june 17 , 1953 , east german workers took to the streets to protest against hardships instigated by the communist regime .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.06.2003 the houdini of italian politics does it again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a faultless performance in court may have saved berlusconi ... for now brought before a milan court on corruption charges , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi managed to postpone his involvement in the case just a day before proceedings are due to be frozen by parliament . in what could be the final dramatic event in a corruption case that has enthralled italy , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi turned the milan courtroom where he was defending himself into a circus by lashing out at the prosecution and delivering a ranting statement that likened the proceedings to a murder trial without evidence . the premier , making only his second appearance in the court since the three-year trial started , made a lengthy statement on his own behalf but refused to answer any questions as he was " running late . "
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .

" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .
even germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , wolfgang clement , has said that the strike for a 35-hour workweek was harmful to the economy .
" the conflict comes at the wrong time in the completely wrong place , " he said in this week ’ s edition of stern magazine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east -lrb- june 2 , 2003 -rrb- .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .

-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .

" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .
historians hope the same fate can be avoided for june 17 , which represented an important milestone in the restoration of democracy in the communist east . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 55 years of gdr uprising on june 17 , 1953 , east german workers took to the streets to protest against hardships instigated by the communist regime .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy .

but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .

his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .

" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .

likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .

the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.06.2003 the houdini of italian politics does it again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a faultless performance in court may have saved berlusconi ... for now brought before a milan court on corruption charges , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi managed to postpone his involvement in the case just a day before proceedings are due to be frozen by parliament . in what could be the final dramatic event in a corruption case that has enthralled italy , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi turned the milan courtroom where he was defending himself into a circus by lashing out at the prosecution and delivering a ranting statement that likened the proceedings to a murder trial without evidence . the premier , making only his second appearance in the court since the three-year trial started , made a lengthy statement on his own behalf but refused to answer any questions as he was " running late . "
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .
however , italy 's richest man has weathered legal and political storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
his first stint as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .

the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .

however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .

the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .
historians hope the same fate can be avoided for june 17 , which represented an important milestone in the restoration of democracy in the communist east . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 55 years of gdr uprising on june 17 , 1953 , east german workers took to the streets to protest against hardships instigated by the communist regime .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .

seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .
even germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , wolfgang clement , has said that the strike for a 35-hour workweek was harmful to the economy .
" the conflict comes at the wrong time in the completely wrong place , " he said in this week ’ s edition of stern magazine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .
historians hope the same fate can be avoided for june 17 , which represented an important milestone in the restoration of democracy in the communist east . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 55 years of gdr uprising on june 17 , 1953 , east german workers took to the streets to protest against hardships instigated by the communist regime .

in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.06.2003 study shows many german green card holders out of work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green cards were given to foreign it experts to help fill high-tech vacancies - but many have now been fired .
with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .
that could mean the country may have to fall back on the very foreigners they had just forced to leave after loosing their jobs , the report concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy birthday ?

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .
however , italy 's richest man has weathered legal and political storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
his first stint as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .

" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.06.2003 the houdini of italian politics does it again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a faultless performance in court may have saved berlusconi ... for now brought before a milan court on corruption charges , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi managed to postpone his involvement in the case just a day before proceedings are due to be frozen by parliament . in what could be the final dramatic event in a corruption case that has enthralled italy , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi turned the milan courtroom where he was defending himself into a circus by lashing out at the prosecution and delivering a ranting statement that likened the proceedings to a murder trial without evidence . the premier , making only his second appearance in the court since the three-year trial started , made a lengthy statement on his own behalf but refused to answer any questions as he was " running late . "
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .
however , italy 's richest man has weathered legal and political storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
his first stint as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .
however , italy 's richest man has weathered legal and political storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
his first stint as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
but his three previous convictions on corruption and fraud charges have all been overturned on appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian premier let off the hook italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi , owes a debt of thanks to his country 's senate as it backed a law that would provide him immunity against a new wave of corruption allegations .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .

bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .

the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .
even germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , wolfgang clement , has said that the strike for a 35-hour workweek was harmful to the economy .
" the conflict comes at the wrong time in the completely wrong place , " he said in this week ’ s edition of stern magazine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .
historians hope the same fate can be avoided for june 17 , which represented an important milestone in the restoration of democracy in the communist east . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 55 years of gdr uprising on june 17 , 1953 , east german workers took to the streets to protest against hardships instigated by the communist regime .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .
even germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , wolfgang clement , has said that the strike for a 35-hour workweek was harmful to the economy .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .

after workers in saxony laid down their tools at the end of may , ig metall unionists in the two other eastern german states joined forces in demanding a shortening of their workweek to the 35 hours currently required of their colleagues in the west .
" by spreading the strike , we want to increase pressure on employers in order to reach an acceptable agreement , " ig metall vice-president jürgen peters said on monday .
east-west divide " 13 years after germany ’ s unification there is still a difference between the eastern and western workweek , " peters told reporters .
for the same pay , engineering and metal workers in the east are required to work 38 hours , whereas their colleagues in the west only put in 35 hours .
the discrepancy between east and west needs to be corrected , the union leader said and called for the gradual reduction of the workweek to the western level .
since the strikes started two weeks ago , some 11,000 people in 10 companies in saxony and five in berlin and brandenburg have taken to the picket line .
the engineering and metal working sector employs around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east .
the strikes have hit some of the region ’ s biggest employers including the bombardier plant in görlitz and the volkswagen plant in zwickau .
no agreement in sight so far , though , there seems to be no end in sight as both ig metall and representatives for the engineering and metal employer ’ s federation fail to come to an agreement .
employers in the economically-depressed east claim the work stoppages are unfair because the factories in the region are less productive than in the west .
a reduction of the workweek to western levels is not possible until the " economic productivity of the eastern german metal and electronics industry meets the western level , " the eastern german employer ’ s federation said in a statement on monday .
the industry ’ s employers are backed by some of the country ’ s leading economic analysts .
speaking in the berliner zeitung on tuesday , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- said the reduced productivity in a 35-hour workweek coupled with the increase in non-wage labor costs would be too much for eastern german companies to handle .
he feared bankruptcy and massive job cuts would be the result .
the ifo-institute in dresden echoed such concerns and said that a shortened work week would only be sustainable once eastern german companies become as productive as their western counterparts .
" this could take as long as 30 years , " marcel thum , the director of the institute , told the paper .
even germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , wolfgang clement , has said that the strike for a 35-hour workweek was harmful to the economy .

with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .

" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .

bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .

june 17 , 1953 ?
never heard of it ?
neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "
a footnote in school books since reunification , memories of the former " day of german unity " have faded .
part of the reason stems from the fact that the date warrants little more than a footnote in the curriculi of many german schools .
" many youth leave school without ever hearing about june 17 , " ulrich arnswald , a pedagogical researcher in frankfurt , who recently conducted a survey that found only one out of three school included the east german worker uprising in lessons , told deutsche welle . for most students , arnswald concluded , the events of june 17 are " as far away as -lrb- ancient -rrb- troy . "
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .
indeed , of the 25-29-year-olds surveyed by emnid , only 28 percent were familiar with the historical event .
the younger the respondent , the wider the knowledge gap - only one out of five young adults between 18 and 24 knew about june 17 .
slouching toward obscurity it was n't always that way .
in the years after the holiday was first introduced , politicians in bonn would gather each year to assess the political situation between the divided lands .
german cities would ring bells in memory of the uprising and west germans wore buttons symbolizing their solidarity with the east german citizens who stood against their government in 1953 .
but over time , the date 's true relevance faded and it became little more than a paid holiday in the minds of most .
by the end of the 1960s , there were even calls to abolish the holiday because people in east germany could not celebrate it .
but the government perservered and the holiday remained on the calendar unit reunification .
historians and politicians say feelings of collective guilt over june 17 amnesia has contributed to the massive effort this year to reintroduce the uprising into the wider public .
marianne birthler , the commissioner who runs the agency that serves as guardian of the archive of the former east german secret police , the stasi , said this year 's events were an attempt to shed new light on a long-neglected aspect of germany 's troubled modern history .
" for a long time , we 've pushed aside june 17 , " birthler said .
" but by doing so , we 've cheated ourselves . "
but on the 50th anniversary , it 's become difficult to ignore the historical events of june 17 .
for weeks now , public television stations have been broadcasting documentaries , films and talk shows about the uprising .
the post office has issued a special commemorative stamp and more than 500 events are being staged across the country to draw attention to the uprising .
last year , the opening of the stasi archives helped shed light on the actual dimension of june 17 .
declassified documents revealed the scope of the uprising - more than 1 million people fought for freedom and democracy in 700 different east german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik despite the new attention that 's been drawn to it , many fear june 17 could soon disappear from public memory so much like the erasure of east germany 's communist landmarks from the landscape of berlin and other cities in the east .
within months of the fall of the wall , all that remained of the cold war symbol was a kilometer-long stretch that was converted into an impromptu art gallery .
former communist street names in the east were replaced almost overnight .
and now , the palace of the republic , once the seat of the east german parliament , is slated to be razed completely .

neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory . fifty years ago tuesday , more than a million workers risked their lives in east germany to participate in protests that nearly toppled the communist government . but today they are remembered by few .
passed by the parliament in bonn less than two weeks after the uprising , june 17 served as a public holiday in western germany for 37 years .
the so-called " day of germany unity " was intended as a day for germans to recall the heroic revolt .
that historic day , east germans , frustrated by increases in the cost of living , increased labor and productivity demands and generally poor living challenged both their own government and russian tanks , calling for the communists ' resignation and the restoration of democracy .
they paid dearly for it - with 50 deaths , hundreds of injuries and as many as 10,000 arrests .
the dustbin of history after german reunification in 1990 , the holiday was eliminated in favor of october 3 .
and now , during the 50th anniversary of june 17 , 1953 , memory of the uprising has nearly faded away .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that only 43 percent of germans knew that june 17 was the day east germans revolted against the communist government .
at least 28 percent of those surveyed thought june 17 was either the day construction began on the berlin wall , the day east germany and west germany were founded or the day the deutsche mark began circulating .
most astonishingly , 29 percent had no idea what happened on june 17 .
though june 17 was officially observed in west germany , for most it was little more than a day off - a sunny summer day to be spent at the lake . " for my generation , june 17 was mostly a holiday , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the actual occasion , unfortunately , did n't play a big role . "

"
universities have also glossed over the important date as well as other watershed moments in east german history .
a study commissioned by the university of halle-wittenberg found that almost 13 years after reunification , only one-third of germany 's institutes for higher education offer lectures or seminars dealing with east german history .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .
however , italy 's richest man has weathered legal and political storms in the past , mostly stemming from his vast media and business empire .
he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .
his first stint as prime minister in 1994 came to an early end , partly because of corruption charges .
but his three previous convictions on corruption and fraud charges have all been overturned on appeal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian premier let off the hook italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi , owes a debt of thanks to his country 's senate as it backed a law that would provide him immunity against a new wave of corruption allegations .

"
the prime minister had been called before the court on numerous other occasions over the course of the trial but had failed to show , citing government commitments for his absence .
attending this time only to harangue the prosecution and present his own views on the proceedings , berlusconi promised to return to court next week , stating that he would only be cross-examined in his prime ministerial offices . silvio 's return unlikely he may not get another chance to appear before the judges , however , as the trial is expected to have collapsed by the time he is scheduled to re-appear .
the italian parliament convenes on wednesday to approve a bill granting the prime minister immunity .
his " smash and grab " approach seemed designed to deny the prosecution the chance to embarrass him by announcing what prison term it wanted before parliament brings the controversial immunity law into force . the law , rushed through parliament , means berlusconi could not be forced to return to court until his term of office expires in 2006 .
however , he would still be protected under the immunity law if he successfully ran for another term .
commentators have said that they strongly believe the case will never be reactivated once parliament freezes the trial on wednesday as is widely expected . when it takes effect , the new immunity law will resurrect a previously embarrassing chapter in italian politics when the " clean hands " investigations of the early 1990s rocked italy and toppled an entire political generation .
the immunity law for politicians was abolished soon after . the new bill would cover italy 's five most senior state officials and has already been passed in the upper house of parliament , the senate .
it is expected to cruise through the lower house , where berlusconi 's forza italia party enjoys a comfortable majority . a theatrical performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the great actor follows the script .
berlusconi arrived at the court house on tuesday facing charges referring to the alleged bribing of judges in rome in an attempt to influence the privatization of the sme state food company in 1985 , before he had entered politics .
berlusconi 's company ultimately took control of sme after its privatization .
seemingly well prepared for battle , the prime minister , in typically determined and belligerent fashion , treated the packed milan court to a performance verging on pure theatre . after accusing the milan court of persecuting him , berlusconi turned on the chief prosecution witness , stefania ariosto , who he branded a compulsive liar .
" all there is is a fantasy cooked up by the person who invented this theory -lrb- of corruption -rrb- .
and i 'm having ... tons of mud slung at me , " berlusconi exclaimed .
he called ariosto a " mythomaniac " and demanded that the witness be charged with slander . a murder case missing key components berlusconi remained animated throughout his statement as he turned his obvious frustration towards the case brought against him .
likening the proceedings to a murder trial that lacked evidence , a body or any other key components , the prime minister sought to discredit the prosecution . " there is no body here , there is no murder weapon , there is no motive ...
i do n't know how this trial came about , or what proof or accusations there are . " then as dramatically as it had all began , it was over .
berlusconi left the court in uproar ; applause mixed with catcalls and shouts of " buffoon " rang out along with his name bellowed in support . more trouble ahead ? the trial comes at an uncomfortable time for berlusconi .
the prime minister is about to lead italy into its six-month spell as holder of the european union 's rotating presidency .
he is also facing considerable domestic political pressure .
forza italia 's coalition partner , the far-right northern league , is warning that it will pull out of the government within weeks if its demands on devolution and immigration are not met . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi may end up all smiles again .

he has faced accusations of false accounting , bribery of tax police and illegally funding his political party .

but for over 30 years the 65-year-old painter , who is renowned for his colorful and energetic works , has been collecting african fetish objects .
now his collection - which fills his house near hildesheim in north-central germany - is on show for the first time .
" baselitz : the african collection " which opened this month at düsseldorf ’ s k20 am grabbeplatz gallery features more than 130 objects collected by baselitz over the past 30 years .
the collection , which ranges from nail and mirror fetishes from the lower congo region to soothsayer bowels , rag dolls and ancestral wood carved figures from the democratic republic of congo , was gathered at leisure and with no specific agenda by baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who says he only collected pieces which interested him .

" one person carves it , then there are the medicine men or priests who turn the sculpture into a fetish figure .

" how is this sinister ? " , baselitz asks , pointing out some of his collection .
" that is a prisoner – he has a noose around his neck .
that is a pair of lovers , almost abstract .
these three , i don ’ t know about - apparently a family or a man with two women .
that ’ s a phallus , and that ’ s a thinker , " baselitz continues .
baselitz , who is regarded as something of a pioneer collector of african art in germany , says he doesn ’ t sense any deeper meaning in the statures and figures .
" in terms of having some kind of magic or fetish meaning , absolutely not .

" baselitz : the african collection " which opened this month at düsseldorf ’ s k20 am grabbeplatz gallery features more than 130 objects collected by baselitz over the past 30 years .
the collection , which ranges from nail and mirror fetishes from the lower congo region to soothsayer bowels , rag dolls and ancestral wood carved figures from the democratic republic of congo , was gathered at leisure and with no specific agenda by baselitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , who says he only collected pieces which interested him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg baselitz not sinister " bateke is a large tribe in the republic of congo .
they have an ancient culture and make their fetish figures themselves .
i started my collection with them and i ’ m still going with them , " baselitz told deutsche welle .
the artist says he finds the figures – made or carved as part of ancient social rituals in africa – interesting because of the many people who work on each individual figure .
" one person carves it , then there are the medicine men or priests who turn the sculpture into a fetish figure .
all the people who work on it leave their mark and that makes it even mysterious , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " seated figure , " wood and iron , from republic of benin in west africa much of baselitz ’ collection hails from east and central africa and includes fetish figures punctured with rusty nails intended to ward off evil , rag dolls representing the deceased , and larger statutes filled with animal jaw bones .
but the artist denies that they are sinister .
" how is this sinister ? " , baselitz asks , pointing out some of his collection .
" that is a prisoner – he has a noose around his neck .
that is a pair of lovers , almost abstract .
these three , i don ’ t know about - apparently a family or a man with two women .
that ’ s a phallus , and that ’ s a thinker , " baselitz continues .
baselitz , who is regarded as something of a pioneer collector of african art in germany , says he doesn ’ t sense any deeper meaning in the statures and figures .
" in terms of having some kind of magic or fetish meaning , absolutely not .
i can ’ t fathom it .
for me , they are simply sculptures , " says baselitz .
the exhibition which also includes evening talks by experts on african art runs until august 24 , 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links k20 gallery düsseldorf - in german and english media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.06.2003 study shows many german green card holders out of work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green cards were given to foreign it experts to help fill high-tech vacancies - but many have now been fired .
with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs . many of germany 's green card workers appear to be out of work , according to new research findings .
the study , which was carried out by the federal labor office 's institute for employment research , showed that seven percent of the foreign it experts in munich - where some 1,500 of the special permit holders came to work - - have registered themselves unemployed since 2000 .
a fifth lost their jobs within a year of arriving in the country .
the nationwide green card program , introduced by chancellor gerhard schröder 's administration in august 2000 , was a bid to quickly fill the job slots created in germany by the it and dotcom boom in the late 1990s .
some 14,000 five-year-long residence permits have since been granted to technology experts who have come to germany mainly from eastern europe , india and north africa .
tip of the iceberg ?
although the ministry 's findings are limited to one city , the study 's author believes the situation in munich may be mirrored across the country .
" it 's possible that unemployment offices in other areas have similar figures , " franziska schreyer , the author of the study wrote .
she added that many more green card holders were likely not to have registered themselves as unemployed , despite losing their jobs .
with the latest figures putting german joblessness at around 4.5 million and the german economy struggling to avoid a recession , the news is the last thing the government needs .
cdu / csu criticizes green card program the opposition christian democrats and christian social union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , who have long argued that the green card program was unnecessary and immigration to germany should be more regulated , immediately went for the jugular , saying the research findings vindicated their position .
" firstly , the german it industry massively overestimated how many specialists it needed during the dotcom boom , " wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu deputy parliamentary group leader responsible for immigration issues , told deutsche welle .
" secondly , the four states , including bavaria , which did not put the law on the statute books , have attracted more specialists than the other 16 states , which did introduce the green card program .
put together ...
-lrb- it proves -rrb- we do not need it -lrb- the green card program -rrb- , " he said .
bosbach maintained that the system was essentially flawed .
" i doubt you are going to attract the best specialists , if you say to them you have to go back after five years , " he said .
he added that the number of german it workers now out of a job had quadrupled since the system was introduced .
although bosbach conceded that the masses of unemployed germans in the it sector were not solely due to the green card program but also a result of the dotcom bomb , he stressed schröder ’ s first task should be to remedy domestic unemployment .
" we should find german it workers a job before we send for foreign specialists , " bosbach told deutsche welle .
not a signal of failure but the federal ministry for economics and labor insisted the research findings were not a sign that the initiative had failed .
" the introduction of the green card program was a complete success , " a spokesperson for the ministry told deutsche welle .
" we have given out 14,400 green cards .
if seven percent of these -lrb- green card holders -rrb- are now unemployed , then that is seven percent too many , but it is still a success when one considers how deep the current crisis in the it industry currently is . "
the spokesperson added that the program was introduced when the it industry was still booming .
the fact that some were now unemployed was simply " a sign of developments in the market , not a sign of the program 's failure . "
the author of the ministry ’ s study also warned that germany - which has a declining birth rate - is dependent on immigrants for its future economic success .
that could mean the country may have to fall back on the very foreigners they had just forced to leave after loosing their jobs , the report concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy birthday ?

whether you are worried about growing your company without losing control , or agonising over funding for a new business , our panellists can help you .
following an overwhelming response , bbc news online is publishing a second instalment of answers to your questions .
we have tried to include as many questions as possible .
anita roddick , founder of the body shop , talks about starting up and unconventional ways of doing business david wilkinson , partner at ernst & young , reveals how to persuade your boss to grow the business liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours , explains how to secure your first client peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking , on costing your business and the ethics of bank managers nigel nicholson , professor , london business school , comments on scaling up management and incentivising staff the next instalment will be published on tuesday , 24 june .
question louise gotts , uk i am currently in employment , have a management degree and one huge , unique business idea that i am itching to develop .
where do i begin ?
can i patent the idea as well as the name ?
it 's hard to know where to start !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop any business starts with an idea .
the big idea .
the idea is everything .
patents cost a lot of money and time .
so do n't do it unless you think it 'll definitely make you money .
discuss the big idea informally in focus groups of people whose opinion you trust and who will give you honest feedback .
check , check and double check what the competition is doing - what are their strengths and weaknesses ?
write a business plan focussed around marketing .
make sure the plan itself looks amazing .
style and image is everything when you 're trying to sell something as nebulous as an idea .
passion persuades .
be enthusiastic .
ask for free advice from people you respect .
question steven , uk i have plans to set up a small ' business ' in the next 18 months .
i use inverted commas because i 'm no longer convinced that it needs to be a money-grabbing , profit-focused organisation .
i 'm beginning to think that a worker 's co-operative or a non-profit trust may be better solutions for my objectives -lrb- i have capital and do n't need to make loads of cash other than to maintain current lifestyle and to provide future capital for the entity -rrb- .
what are the pros & cons of each ?
any thoughts , ideas , inspirations appreciated .
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop there are many ways to structure a business .
whether or not you are ' money-grabbing ' is , i guess , up to you .
whether it 's a conventional business , co-op or non-profit trust , you still need income to run it .
one of the biggest problems with businesses structured in ' unconventional ' ways , in my experience , is that they tend to employ enthusiasts for the cause rather than skill-based staff .
i would simplify this even more .
like you , if i started something now , i would n't even call it a business .
my current focus is on generating an honourable livelihood .
andy law 's new book , ' experiment at work ' , gives some fascinating insights .
return to the top question steve dunn , uk i am part of a management team of a small education company developing resource materials and programmes for blue chip clients .
we wish to grow our company but have an owner md who is resistant to raising capital to facilitate the development of an in-house brand and to recruit personnel needed to expand .
is there a way in which we -lrb- the management team -rrb- could demonstrate how we could grow given a capital injection ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young the development of owner-managed businesses depends very much on the personal objectives of the owners .
in this case , control of the business may be more important than the growth of the business , or it may be a lifestyle decision .
taking on an outside investor does not suit all business owners as it can require a significant change in mentality and management style .
where does that leave the management team ?
to persuade your owner to give up an element of control , you will have to demonstrate real value to the business and therefore to him / her .
i would suggest that you prepare a business plan that sets out how much money you need , what you would do with the money and expected financial outcomes from the investment .
you should also explain the key risks and sensitivities of the project .
if your owner is still not interested , perhaps you should consider a management buy-out , in which case the business plan you prepared could be used to approach outside investors .
return to the top question daniel , uk i 'm pondering starting my own business , providing custom software solutions to other businesses .
i 've narrowed the scope of the idea to an area in which i have professional expertise , which represents a relatively new and small niche market -lrb- namely java applications for mobile devices -rrb- , and identified potential clients .
however , i 'm not sure how to approach them .
in short , what are the best steps to secure the first client ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours approach them direct .
call and ask for the name of the best person to speak to and ask for a short appointment .
ahead of the meeting send any printed material relating to your business .
if you do n't have any , set out a simple , brief information sheet outlining what you can do for your clients and your own expertise and qualifications .
if possible add a couple of brief references from satisfied customers .
take along any examples of your work and demonstration materials .
plan what you want to get across in your meeting and keep it concise .
if the client is interested the meeting will expand or you 'll be asked back .
in any business if you 've completed work to the customer 's satisfaction it 's worth asking them if they 'd be prepared to give you a written reference , talk to a potential client or let them visit the workplace to see the work you 've done .
return to the top question richard o 'halloran , uk i am considering quitting my job to start a business but am worried that without a regular salary i will not have enough money to live on .
i have enough savings to sustain myself for about four months .
when presenting my business plan to a potential lender , how should i best allocate these savings between business running costs and personal living costs , given that i would n't expect the business to generate any income for about three to four months ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you are right to assume that money will be tight in the beginning , whilst you establish yourself in your chosen sector , but ultimately your reason for starting a business will be to provide you with enough money to live comfortably .
as the business develops you will probably be able to take more out of it .
i would recommend reviewing your business plan , financial forecasts and your personal budget with a potential lender or business adviser .
there is plenty of free advice available from a business manager at your chosen bank , business links or local enterprise agency .
question nathan siekierski , england do business bank managers have any ethical obligation for the advice they give to new business .
what if the advice given by a business account manager proves to be the more costly and less manageable ?
can business account managers be accountable for the result from their advice ?
why are there business advisors working who have never worked , owned or run a business ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking all banks , including natwest are committed to the business banking code , a voluntary code which sets the standards of good banking practice for banks dealing with business customers in the uk .
a copy can be obtained from the british bankers association .
advice for small businesses is available from many different sources and should they have any doubt about any guidance given to them , they are not obliged to take it and can seek a second opinion .
whilst some of our business managers may have experience of running their own business , many of them have achieved externally recognised qualifications specific to business .
return to the top question colin palmer , england we have moved from two people in 1998 to around 25 today .
we are wrestling with the twin problems of how to keep the flattest management structure while offering career development paths for our people .
please can you suggest any successful models that we might adopt .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you are still small enough to operate in ' family ' type mode , where people have designated roles but also multi-task -lrb- e.g. everyone is an hr manager in some way and everyone is also in ' marketing ' -rrb- .
but you are also at a growth point that necessitates a small amount of organised hierarchy - you ca n't have 24 people reporting to one boss and it is too large a group to spontaneously self-organise over issues .
in a hierarchy the span of control depends on the complexity of roles and interdependence of people .
so structure depends on what you do and how you do it in your business .
to keep it flat , keep it simple - building teams with fluid membership around your major products , services or processes , with a few short clear lines through to the boss .
keep it flexible and friendly in any event .
as you grow you will need more formal structures to avoid inefficiency and duplication of effort .
question shantau , vietnam what do you do if there is a senior employee in your company who performs well but at the back of your mind you know that you can not trust him ?
how to motivate people ?
just assigning goals is not enough .
we have to offer them something extra .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school this is difficult .
can i refer you to my latest harvard business review article - ' how to motivate your problem people ' -lrb- january / february -rrb- ?
it covers the issues you describe , showing how you can do better by getting closer to the person 's own view of the world .
as for incentives - that 's a complex question .
in any individual case one has to figure out what will work for that individual , since incentives have very different personal impacts .
some people like money .
others crave recognition .
if you want a financial solution , in my experience money works best when it is paid on a gain-sharing basis for specific projects - the individual is motivated by knowing s / he will share in the achieved benefits .

question louise gotts , uk i am currently in employment , have a management degree and one huge , unique business idea that i am itching to develop .
where do i begin ?
can i patent the idea as well as the name ?
it 's hard to know where to start !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop any business starts with an idea .
the big idea .
the idea is everything .
patents cost a lot of money and time .
so do n't do it unless you think it 'll definitely make you money .
discuss the big idea informally in focus groups of people whose opinion you trust and who will give you honest feedback .
check , check and double check what the competition is doing - what are their strengths and weaknesses ?
write a business plan focussed around marketing .
make sure the plan itself looks amazing .
style and image is everything when you 're trying to sell something as nebulous as an idea .
passion persuades .
be enthusiastic .
ask for free advice from people you respect .
question steven , uk i have plans to set up a small ' business ' in the next 18 months .
i use inverted commas because i 'm no longer convinced that it needs to be a money-grabbing , profit-focused organisation .
i 'm beginning to think that a worker 's co-operative or a non-profit trust may be better solutions for my objectives -lrb- i have capital and do n't need to make loads of cash other than to maintain current lifestyle and to provide future capital for the entity -rrb- .
what are the pros & cons of each ?
any thoughts , ideas , inspirations appreciated .
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop there are many ways to structure a business .
whether or not you are ' money-grabbing ' is , i guess , up to you .
whether it 's a conventional business , co-op or non-profit trust , you still need income to run it .
one of the biggest problems with businesses structured in ' unconventional ' ways , in my experience , is that they tend to employ enthusiasts for the cause rather than skill-based staff .
i would simplify this even more .
like you , if i started something now , i would n't even call it a business .
my current focus is on generating an honourable livelihood .
andy law 's new book , ' experiment at work ' , gives some fascinating insights .
return to the top question steve dunn , uk i am part of a management team of a small education company developing resource materials and programmes for blue chip clients .
we wish to grow our company but have an owner md who is resistant to raising capital to facilitate the development of an in-house brand and to recruit personnel needed to expand .
is there a way in which we -lrb- the management team -rrb- could demonstrate how we could grow given a capital injection ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young the development of owner-managed businesses depends very much on the personal objectives of the owners .
in this case , control of the business may be more important than the growth of the business , or it may be a lifestyle decision .
taking on an outside investor does not suit all business owners as it can require a significant change in mentality and management style .
where does that leave the management team ?
to persuade your owner to give up an element of control , you will have to demonstrate real value to the business and therefore to him / her .
i would suggest that you prepare a business plan that sets out how much money you need , what you would do with the money and expected financial outcomes from the investment .
you should also explain the key risks and sensitivities of the project .
if your owner is still not interested , perhaps you should consider a management buy-out , in which case the business plan you prepared could be used to approach outside investors .
return to the top question daniel , uk i 'm pondering starting my own business , providing custom software solutions to other businesses .
i 've narrowed the scope of the idea to an area in which i have professional expertise , which represents a relatively new and small niche market -lrb- namely java applications for mobile devices -rrb- , and identified potential clients .
however , i 'm not sure how to approach them .
in short , what are the best steps to secure the first client ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours approach them direct .
call and ask for the name of the best person to speak to and ask for a short appointment .
ahead of the meeting send any printed material relating to your business .
if you do n't have any , set out a simple , brief information sheet outlining what you can do for your clients and your own expertise and qualifications .
if possible add a couple of brief references from satisfied customers .
take along any examples of your work and demonstration materials .
plan what you want to get across in your meeting and keep it concise .
if the client is interested the meeting will expand or you 'll be asked back .

linda gilroy is to ask newly-appointed home office minister caroline flint for more support in the fight against crack cocaine .
the mp for plymouth sutton says she wants to highlight the growing problem of the highly addictive drug in the city .
last september , police revealed there had been a five-fold increase in the number of cases involving the drug in devon and cornwall over the previous two years .
violent crime ms gilroy believes crack users have a stronger link to crime , especially violent crime .

us aircraft maker boeing has outlined its comeback strategy after it became clear that it will lose its top spot to europe 's airbus this year .
boeing executives predicted that a fuel-efficient 200-seat jet , newly christened the dreamliner 7e7 , is what customers will really want once the current downturn passes .
its fierce rival , airbus , has so far had all the limelight at the paris airshow , after winning a $ 12.5bn -lrb- £ 7.5bn -rrb- order for 41 new planes from the dubai-based airline emirates .
the european aircraft company said it was on target to deliver 300 jets this year - far above its previous forecast of 175 - despite facing the industry 's worst ever downturn .
boeing , however , has notched up just 36 orders so far this year , and is predicting about 280 deliveries in total .
direct path boeing is now concentrating on fuel-efficiency - allowing passengers to fly directly to their destination - as the way forward after ditching ill-fated plans for the high-speed sonic cruiser .
airbus clinched the main deal of the show " we 've made great progress in our conversion from the cruiser to the more fuel-efficient version , " said boeing 's mike bair , who heads the dreamliner project .
" it 's important to get some of the buzz back , " he said , forecasting demand for up to 3,000 of the new planes over the next 20 years .
there is already mounting speculation as to who will help build the new jets , with japan 's mitsubishi hoping for a slice of the action .
boeing forecasts that airlines will spend about $ 3.3 trillion on maintenance , training and support over the next two decades , and is hoping that 2004 will be the year for recovery .
" boeing 's best assessment is that traffic comes back in 2003 , the airlines repair their balance sheets and keep working on their productivity , and get back on track in 2004 , " boeing chief executive alan mulally said .
signs of hope airbus , however , says it is already seeing the start of a turnaround .
the biennial air show first took place in 1909 " the market is better than we expected , and our market share has increased much more than we anticipated , " said airbus chief executive noel forgeard .
" we are realistic about the current economic environment , but we are also optimistic . "
the sars outbreak in asia , the war in iraq , and concerns over terrorism and slow economic growth have all depressed airline traffic , leading the major carriers to cut back on orders for new aircraft .
the industry has racked up losses of about $ 30bn over the past two years , and is expected to lose a further $ 10bn this year .
the industry 's crisis means the planes are likely to have been sold at a heavy discount from the catalogue prices being quoted .

kingfisher shareholders will receive one kesa share for each kingfisher share they hold and the stock will be listed in london and paris .
the retail giant wants to split from kesa so it can concentrate on the faster-growing home improvements market , where it owns the b & q chain .
kesa , which includes french chains darty and but , is europe 's third-largest electricals retailer .
weak demand kingfisher has set a date of july 7 for the demerger .
it said the move marked the final step in its strategic overhaul , which has already seen the demerger of woolworths and superdrug .
analysts expect kesa to have a market value of between £ 800m and £ 1.3bn , placing it in london 's ftse 250 index .
kesa 's sales for the year to 1 february were more than £ 3.4bn , with retail profits of £ 193.3m.
the new company will be led by british chairman david newlands and french chief executive jean-noel labroue .
kesa has 790 stores in seven countries , but it will generate 75 % of its profits in france .
some analysts believe kesa may struggle to find its feet mainly because of weak consumer confidence in france .
