indeed , each of the executives who met with the chancellor represent companies whose overall market capitalization exceeds $ 1 billion .
schröder had a clear message for each one .
" i don ’ t think there ’ s another european economy that is as interwoven with america as germany ’ s , " schröder told executives gathered in new york .
" more than 800,000 jobs exist with german subsidiaries -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- and , conversely , 500,000 jobs in -lrb- american subsidiaries -rrb- in germany .
that shows the relationship . "
reforms " right track " the goal of the chancellor ’ s two-day trip to new york was to drum up support for foreign investment in germany – investments he said would be buttressed by current federal structural reforms currently being considered by parliament that would loosen labor laws and cut taxes and modernize germany ’ s much-criticized economy .
" i believe that the implementation of the agenda will raise the readiness of american investors to get involved in germany , " schröder said .
" it is seen clearly here that we are on the right track . "
the chancellor also conceded that the strong euro has created a problem for german exporters , which makes it more difficult for american companies to purchase european products .
still , schröder said he saw no signs that the weakness of the u.s. dollar had been the result of deliberate manipulation .
" i think everyone understands that it ’ s in the interest of america , germany and europe for the relation -lrb- between the currencies -rrb- to level off , " schröder said .
" no one in america can really be interested in a weak dollar . "
though schröder ’ s agenda did not include meetings with american political leaders , he did deliver a clear political message : germany is and will remain a close and reliable partner in the international war against terror – even if differences of opinion persist .
" of course in these talks with business people the question of what consequences the terrorist attacks in istanbul will have , " he said .
more than 50 people were killed and at least 450 injured in four suicide bombings in istanbul this week that targeted jewish institutions as well as the british consulate and local headquarters of britain ’ s hsbc bank .
countering fears in addition to his visits with top business leaders , schröder also met with jewish community leaders in part to assuage fears that anti-semitism is on the rise again in germany in the wake of recent scandals involving publicly elected officials and right-wing groups .
schröder said friday that the subject of anti-semitism had only been discussed in " general form , " and that most of his discussion with leaders from 13 jewish organizations focused on conflict in the middle east .
those leaders , meanwhile. called on schröder and other leaders to demonstrate more understanding of israel ’ s position in the conflict with the palestinians . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sells economic reforms for u.s. investment chancellor gerhard schröder is in new york to promote business ties and attract greater u.s. investment .

indeed , each of the executives who met with the chancellor represent companies whose overall market capitalization exceeds $ 1 billion .
schröder had a clear message for each one .
" i don ’ t think there ’ s another european economy that is as interwoven with america as germany ’ s , " schröder told executives gathered in new york .
" more than 800,000 jobs exist with german subsidiaries -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- and , conversely , 500,000 jobs in -lrb- american subsidiaries -rrb- in germany .
that shows the relationship . "
reforms " right track " the goal of the chancellor ’ s two-day trip to new york was to drum up support for foreign investment in germany – investments he said would be buttressed by current federal structural reforms currently being considered by parliament that would loosen labor laws and cut taxes and modernize germany ’ s much-criticized economy .
" i believe that the implementation of the agenda will raise the readiness of american investors to get involved in germany , " schröder said .
" it is seen clearly here that we are on the right track . "
the chancellor also conceded that the strong euro has created a problem for german exporters , which makes it more difficult for american companies to purchase european products .
still , schröder said he saw no signs that the weakness of the u.s. dollar had been the result of deliberate manipulation .
" i think everyone understands that it ’ s in the interest of america , germany and europe for the relation -lrb- between the currencies -rrb- to level off , " schröder said .
" no one in america can really be interested in a weak dollar . "
though schröder ’ s agenda did not include meetings with american political leaders , he did deliver a clear political message : germany is and will remain a close and reliable partner in the international war against terror – even if differences of opinion persist .
" of course in these talks with business people the question of what consequences the terrorist attacks in istanbul will have , " he said .
more than 50 people were killed and at least 450 injured in four suicide bombings in istanbul this week that targeted jewish institutions as well as the british consulate and local headquarters of britain ’ s hsbc bank .

in an address to the nation , alejandro toledo said millions of dollars would be spent on the areas most affected .
investigators have said at least 40,000 and possibly as many as 60,000 people were killed during 20 years of terror .
about three-quarters of the killings were carried out by the maoist shining path and other guerrilla groups .
more than 30 % of the confirmed killings were carried out by government forces .
responsibility " i ask for pardon , " said president toledo , " in the name of the state for all those who suffered ... for all the victims of violence and terror " .
he added that although his government was not in power at the time , he could not avoid responsibility for the violence .
president toledo said his government would implement what he called a peace and development plan in the areas most severely affected by the violence , investing millions of dollars .
the plan was recommended by the peace and reconciliation commission set up by his government two years ago to look into the killings .
slow recovery the commission based its conclusions on interviews with 18,000 witnesses .
shining path began its insurgency among peru 's indigenous communities which live in remote rural areas but later spread its campaign to the towns and cities .
the security forces responded , often using illegal means .
the then president , alberto fujimori imposed martial law in 1992 and finally crushed the rebels , capturing the group 's founder , abimael guzman .
but much of peru was devastated by the violence and has been slow to recover .
president toledo 's words will be very welcome but peruvians will also want to see his promises put into action .

the president told reporters he and tony blair had strengthened their resolve to fight terrorism together .
he flew back from teesside airport on air force one on friday evening after spending the day in prime minister tony blair 's constituency of sedgefield .
a £ 1m security operation took place as 500 people protested in the area .

"
he said it provided " the chance to continue our dialogue about how to fight and defeat terror " .
earlier , he visited mr blair 's house in the village of trimdon colliery and the two men and their wives had lunch at the dun cow inn in sedgefield town centre .
mr bush told reporters : " we had a good lunch .
i have had a wonderful trip .
the prime minister has been a gracious host , as was her majesty . "
after lunch , the party visited sedgefield community college , a specialist sports school , to talk to pupils and watch a display of football skills .
private visit the protesters in sedgefield were addressed by leaders of the stop the war coalition and local politicians .
john rees of the stop the war coalition said : " we want george bush to understand that when he scuttled out of london , there would be no escape from us in the north east .
tony blair said the uk had an " enduring " ally " we have made a mockery of this visit and it deserves to be made a mockery of because they wanted to make a mockery of us .
" they wanted to use this visit to launch president bush 's election campaign . "
but mr bush also received support as his helicopter landed on playing fields in trimdon near mr blair 's myrobella home .
coach driver michael evans said : " mr blair lives here , we wanted him as our mp , and if he wants to invite mr bush , then it is a great honour for the people of trimdon .

" it has never happened before and it is just a great honour to have him . "
president bush 's state visit to the uk ended when he left buckingham palace earlier on friday .
the trip to sedgefield was deemed a private visit .
the state visit was overshadowed on thursday by the bomb attacks in turkey in which 27 people - including four britons - lost their lives and at least 450 were injured .
roads in sedgefield were closed to traffic during the presidential visit , while drains , post boxes and rubbish bins were sealed .
the nearby village of trimdon colliery , where mr blair has his constituency home , was also been affected by the traffic measures , as have some nearby main roads .

assistance had been frozen because of concerns over corruption and due to the country 's poor economic record .
president mwai kibaki says he hopes donors will follow the imf 's lead and resume financial support .

job creation the imf is allowing kenya to immediately draw $ 36.1m of the three-year loan under its poverty reduction and growth facility -lrb- prgf -rrb- which provides low interest loans to developing countries .
the fund - and its sister body , the world bank - had cut off the flow of money to nairobi , after what it saw as the refusal by the former government of daniel arap moi to take action against kenya 's all-pervasive corruption .
but after president kibaki took power and pushed through laws to curb corruption and strengthen the judiciary , the institutions changed their stance .
approval of the loan is likely to encourage foreign investment and donations from individual countries .
the programme attached to the loan aims to create jobs , reduce domestic debt and reform the country 's financial system .

it comes as a report on how the current assembly system is working is due to be published .
the richard commission report has gathered the comments of members of the public and organisations in wales since the beginning of the year .
mr morgan has been criticised in the past for sitting on the fence about the further devolution of powers to the welsh assembly .
addressing the welsh conference of the labour group , progress , at city hall in cardiff on saturday , mr morgan outlined the process the party should go through , including how party members should have their say .
he stressed that the report would not be " kicked into the long grass , nor to the top shelf of the welsh political archive " .
he talked about how he intended to have a period of formal consultation within the welsh labour party and to have a special recall conference in july next year to " agree our response to the richard commission report . "
lord richard of ammanford is heading the inquiry he went on to say that the party should avoid " portraying the constitutional choices available to wales as being either a retention of the status quo ... or its replacement with the scottish model " .
" there are many alternative models which would allow us to continue the momentum of devolution , " he added .
the richard commission has spent several months canvassing the opinions of members of the public in a series of seven public meetings .
