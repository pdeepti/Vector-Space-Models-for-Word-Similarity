his election - with a vote of 99.3 % in favour - came as no surprise and completes the country 's leadership changes , steered through by outgoing leader jiang zemin .
on saturday , hu jintao - who was appointed to the leadership of the communist party last november - was elected president .
correspondents say mr jiang will retain much of his influence by keeping his key post as chairman of the central military commission -lrb- cmc -rrb- , which runs the army .
mr hu , as well as becoming president , will remain deputy chairman of the cmc .
in other changes approved at the npc session , the deputy leader of the chinese communist party , wu bangguo , was appointed chairman of parliament .
zeng qinghong , another jiang zemin loyalist , was elected vice-president .

wen jiabao , 60 , replaces zhu rongji , who had lead china through a series of capitalist reforms .
profile of wen jiabao however , mr zhu had been unable to prevent a growing gap between rich and poor , and attendant social problems .
the bbc 's francis markus says mr zhu - who has been easily china 's most charismatic politician - will be a hard act to follow .
correspondents say mr wen will have to work hard to boost economic growth , but add that there is little expectation of new policies being introduced in a hurry .

it claims to be one of the biggest sex shops in the world .
but the simply pleasure superstore is not located in amsterdam 's red light district or on a backstreet in soho .
it sits just off a major roundabout in oldham .
there was considerable opposition to the 3,000 sq ft store opening on park road in a run-down area of the town .
councillors spoke of " social devastation " and religious leaders feared the morals of the town would be corrupted .
to many , oldham may not be the obvious choice to open such a shop .
but business development director chris brown rejects the notion that oldhamers are stuffy reactionaries .
simply pleasure bosses say it chiefly attracts single women " it is the kind of thing that you would expect to find in manchester and london , but why not here ? " he told bbc news online .
" we are north west-based and we want to get it right and do it in our own area , " he said .
the company wants to extend its business across the country .
mr brown says the whole point of the " one stop shop " idea is to take some of the sleaze out of the sex industry .
so out go the blacked-out windows .
single males " it 's a bright , vibrant building and the staff are well trained , " he said .
" seventy four per cent of our customers are actually single females coming in to buy for themselves by just wandering in off the street , which is unheard of in this industry .
the shop is located in oldham " a further 22 % are couples coming in together and buying things together .
it is a very small percentage of single males coming in . "
the shop took £ 15,000 on its opening day , and £ 40,000 in the first week .
but it has been targeted by vandals - last week a window was smashed on the park road premises .
mr brown said : " we do n't know who it was .
we do n't know if it 's something to do with us in the shop or if it 's just vandalism . "
the £ 3,000 bed security has now been increased .
inside , the shop offers the expected magazines and videos .
there are also books on massage , items of lingerie , a board game called monogamy .
the most expensive item is what the shop describes as a " four poster fantasy bed " - a pvc-covered bed made of chains - costing £ 2,995 .
