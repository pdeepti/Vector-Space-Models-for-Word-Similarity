ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .

team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .

" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .

" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .

pierre raffarin and gerhard schröder in berlin the berlin-paris axis gets stronger with plans for a historic joint parliamentary session and talk of listening in on each other 's cabinet meetings . once strained franco-german relations got even cosier on thursday evening when the french prime minister , pierre raffarin and german chancellor , gerhard schröder met in berlin to finalize plans for a historic joint session of their parliaments . the session – part of celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the “ elysee treaty ” - is planned for january 22nd and will see german bundestag and the french national assembly come together in the versailles palace on the outskirts of paris . the session is to be broadcast live on franco-german bilingual channel , “ arte ” and schröder and chirac are expected to announce a joint commitment to act in concert during the two years germany holds a seat in the un security council . ever closer union the current union between france and germany is a massive turnaround from the state of relations just six months ago and far closer to the spirit of the treaty both states signed in 1963 . under the terms of the treaty , france and germany promised to end rivalries and work together towards creating new europe .

team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races . " launch control , which guides drivers out of the starting grid , team-to-driver radio communication and telemetry , which helps the team and driver electronically identify problems with the car , will be disallowed as soon as this coming season .
traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .
formula 1 's dominating figure , michael schumacher , greeted the news with some caution .
" it is always difficult to drive to the limit , with or without electronic driving aid , " said schumacher , who finished in the top three in all 16 races this season and sewed up the overall championship in record time .

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races . " launch control , which guides drivers out of the starting grid , team-to-driver radio communication and telemetry , which helps the team and driver electronically identify problems with the car , will be disallowed as soon as this coming season .
traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .
formula 1 's dominating figure , michael schumacher , greeted the news with some caution .
" it is always difficult to drive to the limit , with or without electronic driving aid , " said schumacher , who finished in the top three in all 16 races this season and sewed up the overall championship in record time .
" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races . " launch control , which guides drivers out of the starting grid , team-to-driver radio communication and telemetry , which helps the team and driver electronically identify problems with the car , will be disallowed as soon as this coming season .
traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .
formula 1 's dominating figure , michael schumacher , greeted the news with some caution .
" it is always difficult to drive to the limit , with or without electronic driving aid , " said schumacher , who finished in the top three in all 16 races this season and sewed up the overall championship in record time .
" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .
" one thing is clear , " said schumacher .

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .

" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races . " launch control , which guides drivers out of the starting grid , team-to-driver radio communication and telemetry , which helps the team and driver electronically identify problems with the car , will be disallowed as soon as this coming season .
traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .
formula 1 's dominating figure , michael schumacher , greeted the news with some caution .
" it is always difficult to drive to the limit , with or without electronic driving aid , " said schumacher , who finished in the top three in all 16 races this season and sewed up the overall championship in record time .
" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .
" one thing is clear , " said schumacher .
" it 's more dangerous in the rain without traction control . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de undisputed king of the formula one circuit michael schumacher entered the record books by winning his fifth formula one racing season title of his career .
but the driver has n't made many friends in his astounding race to the top .

german police and customs officials have seized at least two truckloads of materials in search of evidence linking the company to alleged foreign trade and tax violations .
according to customs investigator leonhard bierl , the chief allegation against reemtsma involves aiding and abetting cigarette smuggling .
" cigarettes are manufactured here and exported to eastern europe , for example , " said bierl .
" but from the very start , they are designed for the black market here . "
he said that reemtsma 's clients are then smuggling these cigarettes back to germany by a third party .
" that is a lucrative business .
by avoiding the high tobacco taxes and import duties that are levied here , an awful lot of money can be made with the cigarettes sold on the black market here in germany . "
reemtsma , a subsidiary of britain 's imperial tobacco and germany 's third largest cigarette company , is also being accused of supplying cigarettes to iraq , in violation of the u.n. trade embargo .
" excessive " measures the reemtsma group has denied all allegations .
speaker of the board , manfred häussler , said in a statement that the company had supported authorities for years in fighting cigarette smuggling .
it was thus " completely surprised " by the customs raid , said häussler , who is also alleged to be involved .
" we consider the confiscation measures by customs in this operation to be completely excessive , " he said .
" reemtsma has no interest in promoting cigarette smuggling , nor in violating u.n. sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette brands of german tobacco company reemtsma the company said it is now screening its clients for their legitimacy .
reemtsma would no longer supply those found to be violating the law , it said .
it added that it was in the company 's own interest to battle illegal smuggling , as this paved the way for counterfeit cigarette brands and , thus , less profits .
sifting through the evidence the authorities now have to prove that reemtsma exported the cigarettes with the deliberate intention of smuggling them back into the country .
simply exporting the goods themselves is not punishable by law .
but with the many crates of documents , diskettes and hard drives confiscated since tuesday , officials have their work cut out for them .
" several months will be needed to analyze the contents , " said hamburg 's chief prosecutor rüdiger bagger .
a european problem the decisive tip about reemtsma came from the european anti-fraud office olaf in brussels .
for years , the european union has been concerned about the economic losses caused by smuggled cigarettes .
" cigarette smuggling is taking place on a large scale throughout europe , " said eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer .
all european countries with high tobacco taxes suffer from this problem .
cigarettes are crossing borders in coffins or in food tins .
the cartons are hidden in furniture or in the hollowed-out doors of trucks .
germany is often just a transit country for transporting the smuggled goods .
but olaf is continuously seeking ways to stop these practices and to take legal action against the perpetrators , schreyer said .
it organizes close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the eu member states , as well as helping them in their anti-fraud activities . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olaf : the european anti-fraud office further information on olaf 's objectives and methods . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german police and customs officials have seized at least two truckloads of materials in search of evidence linking the company to alleged foreign trade and tax violations .
according to customs investigator leonhard bierl , the chief allegation against reemtsma involves aiding and abetting cigarette smuggling .
" cigarettes are manufactured here and exported to eastern europe , for example , " said bierl .
" but from the very start , they are designed for the black market here . "
he said that reemtsma 's clients are then smuggling these cigarettes back to germany by a third party .
" that is a lucrative business .
by avoiding the high tobacco taxes and import duties that are levied here , an awful lot of money can be made with the cigarettes sold on the black market here in germany . "
reemtsma , a subsidiary of britain 's imperial tobacco and germany 's third largest cigarette company , is also being accused of supplying cigarettes to iraq , in violation of the u.n. trade embargo .
" excessive " measures the reemtsma group has denied all allegations .
speaker of the board , manfred häussler , said in a statement that the company had supported authorities for years in fighting cigarette smuggling .
it was thus " completely surprised " by the customs raid , said häussler , who is also alleged to be involved .
" we consider the confiscation measures by customs in this operation to be completely excessive , " he said .
" reemtsma has no interest in promoting cigarette smuggling , nor in violating u.n. sanctions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette brands of german tobacco company reemtsma the company said it is now screening its clients for their legitimacy .
reemtsma would no longer supply those found to be violating the law , it said .
it added that it was in the company 's own interest to battle illegal smuggling , as this paved the way for counterfeit cigarette brands and , thus , less profits .
sifting through the evidence the authorities now have to prove that reemtsma exported the cigarettes with the deliberate intention of smuggling them back into the country .
simply exporting the goods themselves is not punishable by law .
but with the many crates of documents , diskettes and hard drives confiscated since tuesday , officials have their work cut out for them .
" several months will be needed to analyze the contents , " said hamburg 's chief prosecutor rüdiger bagger .
a european problem the decisive tip about reemtsma came from the european anti-fraud office olaf in brussels .
for years , the european union has been concerned about the economic losses caused by smuggled cigarettes .
" cigarette smuggling is taking place on a large scale throughout europe , " said eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer .
all european countries with high tobacco taxes suffer from this problem .
cigarettes are crossing borders in coffins or in food tins .
the cartons are hidden in furniture or in the hollowed-out doors of trucks .
germany is often just a transit country for transporting the smuggled goods .
but olaf is continuously seeking ways to stop these practices and to take legal action against the perpetrators , schreyer said .
it organizes close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the eu member states , as well as helping them in their anti-fraud activities . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links olaf : the european anti-fraud office further information on olaf 's objectives and methods . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german police and customs officials have seized at least two truckloads of materials in search of evidence linking the company to alleged foreign trade and tax violations .
according to customs investigator leonhard bierl , the chief allegation against reemtsma involves aiding and abetting cigarette smuggling .
" cigarettes are manufactured here and exported to eastern europe , for example , " said bierl .
" but from the very start , they are designed for the black market here . "
he said that reemtsma 's clients are then smuggling these cigarettes back to germany by a third party .
" that is a lucrative business .
by avoiding the high tobacco taxes and import duties that are levied here , an awful lot of money can be made with the cigarettes sold on the black market here in germany . "
reemtsma , a subsidiary of britain 's imperial tobacco and germany 's third largest cigarette company , is also being accused of supplying cigarettes to iraq , in violation of the u.n. trade embargo .
" excessive " measures the reemtsma group has denied all allegations .
speaker of the board , manfred häussler , said in a statement that the company had supported authorities for years in fighting cigarette smuggling .
it was thus " completely surprised " by the customs raid , said häussler , who is also alleged to be involved .
" we consider the confiscation measures by customs in this operation to be completely excessive , " he said .
" reemtsma has no interest in promoting cigarette smuggling , nor in violating u.n. sanctions . "

ferrari red , to be exact . it seemed that not a race went by without a ferrari driver spraying his podium companions with champagne .
of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races . " launch control , which guides drivers out of the starting grid , team-to-driver radio communication and telemetry , which helps the team and driver electronically identify problems with the car , will be disallowed as soon as this coming season .
traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .
formula 1 's dominating figure , michael schumacher , greeted the news with some caution .
" it is always difficult to drive to the limit , with or without electronic driving aid , " said schumacher , who finished in the top three in all 16 races this season and sewed up the overall championship in record time .
" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .
" one thing is clear , " said schumacher .

of the 16 races , ferrari driver michael schumacher won 10 of them .
his teammate rubens barrichelo finished second in the overall standings .
and ferrari won the constructor 's cup . that sort of success could fade in the coming years following the introduction of new rules this week by the sport 's governing body that would strive for a parity in a rich man 's sport . the f1 technical working group is meeting friday to discuss changes that will cut costs for the 10 formula 1 teams and bring racing back closer to its roots .
team owners and fia officials have called the changes nothing short of an earthquake in a sport that has lost viewers and interest in recent years with the success of precious few teams .
less wizardry , more driver control in the coming years , the costly technological wizardry that has helped teams like ferrari , bmw williams and mclaren maintain a lock on both the driver 's and constructor 's championships , will be gradually phased out . " looking at it calmly , -lrb- the teams -rrb- will see that it was the only way to revive formula one , " max mosely , fia 's president , said in an interview with the guardian .
" there is no sense in having a futuristic technology on the track if people then turn their backs and no longer watch the races .

traction control , fully automatic gearboxes also face extinction in formula 1 racing in 2003 . teams will also only be allowed two cars per race , eliminating the replacement car . in 2004 , fia will introduce standard braking systems , rear wings and other long-life components .
in 2005 and 2006 , teams will have to use the same engine for more than one race and see the elimination of " expensive , exotic materials on any part of the car , " according to fia . lukewarm to warm reception by drivers the sudden announcement sent shockwaves through the sport .
though most team ownersp referred to withhold comment until the outcome of the technical working group meeting , many drivers were quick to throw their support behind the new rules .
" when the artificial helping hands fall away , the driver is 40 percent more valuable , " said heiny-harald frentzen , whose team , sauba , finished fifth overall last season .

" i prefer every option that can make a car faster , but i 'll take it as it comes . "
critics say that losing team-to-driver communication and the telemetry system could spell more danger for the drivers , who will no longer get early warnings on crashes on the track or possible engine trouble . the loss of traction control could mean trouble in unfavorable racing conditions .

the epidemic of 2001 led to the slaughter of more than six million animals and is estimated to have cost the uk as much as £ 4bn .
but it has now emerged trading standards officers have reported thousands of animals are being moved illegally by farmers and livestock dealers .
it was the rapid unrecorded movement of livestock which caused foot-and-mouth disease to spread out of control .
in surrey , reports involve the illegal dealing of sheep across three county borders .
in cornwall , officials have targeted dealers and farmers trading hundreds of cattle without keeping records including animal passports .
dramatic changes but the news comes at a time when farmers are calling for the laws on animal movements to be relaxed because they say they are unworkable .
the 2001 epidemic was vastly more serious than the last major outbreak in 1967 , because of dramatic changes in the farming industry .
continuous national movement of animals made it hard to trace the progress of the disease .
cumbria was particularly badly affected after the arrival of infected animals at a livestock market .
during the crisis , as well as the decimation of livestock farming , british tourism was badly affected , with foreign visitors put off by images of burning pyres of carcasses .

the epidemic of 2001 led to the slaughter of more than six million animals and is estimated to have cost the uk as much as £ 4bn .
but it has now emerged trading standards officers have reported thousands of animals are being moved illegally by farmers and livestock dealers .
it was the rapid unrecorded movement of livestock which caused foot-and-mouth disease to spread out of control .
in surrey , reports involve the illegal dealing of sheep across three county borders .
in cornwall , officials have targeted dealers and farmers trading hundreds of cattle without keeping records including animal passports .
dramatic changes but the news comes at a time when farmers are calling for the laws on animal movements to be relaxed because they say they are unworkable .
the 2001 epidemic was vastly more serious than the last major outbreak in 1967 , because of dramatic changes in the farming industry .
continuous national movement of animals made it hard to trace the progress of the disease .
cumbria was particularly badly affected after the arrival of infected animals at a livestock market .
during the crisis , as well as the decimation of livestock farming , british tourism was badly affected , with foreign visitors put off by images of burning pyres of carcasses .
