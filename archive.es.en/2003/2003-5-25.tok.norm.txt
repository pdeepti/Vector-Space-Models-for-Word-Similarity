germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .
" germany is n't a cheap-wage country and it should n't ever be allowed to sail under a cheap flag . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder but the unions ' increased rhetoric will likely leave the chancellor cold .
after scraping to win in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . grinding to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .
and comments by german defense minister peter struck on saturday showed just how wide the rift between the spd and the unions had become .
" some people are abusing the friendship that ties us to the unions , " struck told the german news agency dpa , referring to the latest attacks against the government 's reform plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.05.2003 turkey wins eurovision song contest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener blows a kiss to her fans after the winning the eurovision song contest in riga , latvia .
turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .
" germany is n't a cheap-wage country and it should n't ever be allowed to sail under a cheap flag . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder but the unions ' increased rhetoric will likely leave the chancellor cold .
after scraping to win in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . grinding to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .
and comments by german defense minister peter struck on saturday showed just how wide the rift between the spd and the unions had become .
" some people are abusing the friendship that ties us to the unions , " struck told the german news agency dpa , referring to the latest attacks against the government 's reform plans .

germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .
" germany is n't a cheap-wage country and it should n't ever be allowed to sail under a cheap flag . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder but the unions ' increased rhetoric will likely leave the chancellor cold .
after scraping to win in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . grinding to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .
and comments by german defense minister peter struck on saturday showed just how wide the rift between the spd and the unions had become .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .
" germany is n't a cheap-wage country and it should n't ever be allowed to sail under a cheap flag . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder but the unions ' increased rhetoric will likely leave the chancellor cold .
after scraping to win in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . grinding to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .
and comments by german defense minister peter struck on saturday showed just how wide the rift between the spd and the unions had become .
" some people are abusing the friendship that ties us to the unions , " struck told the german news agency dpa , referring to the latest attacks against the government 's reform plans .

german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .
dw-world has a wrap-up . bayern munich once again showed its total dominance of german soccer this year by securing the bundesliga championship for a record 18th time .
bayern even managed to win the title four matches before the season was over . bayern ’ s early victory caused the focus to shift to the nail-biting battle to avoid relegation to the second division and jockeying for lucrative champions league and uefa cup berths . one of the biggest stories this year was the dramatic slide of once bayern rival bayer leverkusen .
after managing to be league runner-up last year , leverkusen was in jeopardy being relegated for much of the season .
but the team managed eke by after beating nuremberg 1-0 . “ we got away with two black eyes , ” said leverkusen ’ s manager reiner calmund , according to the sports news agency sid .
“ the season was a warning shot .
we have to definitely change a few things . ” augenthaler stays in the top league ironically , leverkusen ’ s new coach is klaus augenthaler , who was only just fired by nuremberg for leading that team to the second division .
relegated along with nuremberg are arminia bielefeld , which lost to hannover 96 0-1 at home , and the league ’ s worst team energie cottbus . but cottbus got some final schadenfreude out of the season by drawing 1-1 with last year ’ s champion borussia dortmund .
the tie means dortmund only managed to finish third overall and will have to fight its way through a qualifying round to make to the champions league . in a surprise finish , vfb stuttgart took the bundesliga ’ s second place , giving the team a direct spot in top european competition next year .
after an extremely solid season , stuttgart ’ s coach felix magath has already announced his intention to take on bayern for the title in the coming years . hamburg and berlin in uefa cup hamburg sv and hertha berlin , the bundesliga ’ s fourth and fifth place finishers will round out germany ’ s european competition hopes with uefa cup spots .
debt-laden team kaiserslautern will also get a uefa berth due its appearance in the german cup final .

but the league will have to do without some of germany ’ s most memorable players including stefan effenberg , mario basler , andreas möller , thomas häßler and michael preetz , who are all either retiring or leaving the bundesliga to play abroad . “ it ’ s always a shame to lose such guys , ” stuttgart ’ s coach magath told the german news agency dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de porto 's " silva " goal sinks celtic fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .
dw-world has a wrap-up . bayern munich once again showed its total dominance of german soccer this year by securing the bundesliga championship for a record 18th time .
bayern even managed to win the title four matches before the season was over . bayern ’ s early victory caused the focus to shift to the nail-biting battle to avoid relegation to the second division and jockeying for lucrative champions league and uefa cup berths . one of the biggest stories this year was the dramatic slide of once bayern rival bayer leverkusen .
after managing to be league runner-up last year , leverkusen was in jeopardy being relegated for much of the season .
but the team managed eke by after beating nuremberg 1-0 . “ we got away with two black eyes , ” said leverkusen ’ s manager reiner calmund , according to the sports news agency sid .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

" social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .

this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.05.2003 turkey wins eurovision song contest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener blows a kiss to her fans after the winning the eurovision song contest in riga , latvia .
turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .

" social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .

economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .

i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views .

germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .

this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .

germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms . union organizers said almost 100,000 people took part in nationwide demonstrations , in one last major rally against the government 's reform plans before a special congress of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on june 1 . german chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to hold the party congress next week , since much of the spd 's grassroots are unhappy with a package of sweeping reforms the chancellor announced in march to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . both the left-wing faction of the spd and the unions hope saturday 's demonstrations will help derail the government 's so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , which aims to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . " social reforms grab into the pockets of the small people in order to plug holes in the budget , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , said at a rally in schröder 's hometown of hannover .
" germany is n't a cheap-wage country and it should n't ever be allowed to sail under a cheap flag . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder but the unions ' increased rhetoric will likely leave the chancellor cold .
after scraping to win in last september ’ s general election , he has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures . grinding to a halt in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of over 10 percent .
this year , the economy is now teetering on the brink of recession after it shrank the first quarter of 2003 . speaking at the spd 's 140th anniversary celebrations on friday , schröder attempted to convince the party faithful that deviating from his reform course would spell disaster for the social democrats : " either we will modernize ourselves - naturally as a social market economy - or we will be modernized without a doubt by unchecked market forces . " schröder has effectively turned the june 1 party congress into a vote of confidence , since he has indirectly threatened to resign should the spd not back his reform package .
but even if he manages to get his center-left coalition to pass agenda 2010 , down the road he and the social democrats will likely have difficulty trying to make amends with the unions , which are a traditional spd constituency .
and comments by german defense minister peter struck on saturday showed just how wide the rift between the spd and the unions had become .
" some people are abusing the friendship that ties us to the unions , " struck told the german news agency dpa , referring to the latest attacks against the government 's reform plans .
" it 's completely uncalled for behavior for which i have zero understanding .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu . sertab erener – - one of turkey ’ s most popular female vocalists – - won the competition late saturday night by combining her song “ everyway that i can ” with a well choreography stage show inspired by turkish belly dancing . held this year in the small baltic state latvia , the eurovision contest , as always , melded politics and partisan voting with glitzy , sometimes downright cheesy , pop music .
watched by an estimated 160 million viewers around the world , the latvians put on an impressive show that came down to exciting head-to-head final vote . it was a surprise win for the turks .
belgium ’ s urban trad led for much of the voting , but many in the latvian capital riga had been betting on russia ’ s pseudo-lesbian duo tatu .
the group had been so hyped to win that their every move was followed in the run up to saturday night . seventeen year-old elena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova sulked their way through press conferences , told journalists they were planning to spend their time off having “ sex in a very small bed ” and caused havoc at rehearsals . eurovision organizers feared the two would do something on saturday that would not be deemed good clean family fun .
rumors abounded that tatu might strip on stage .
or snog .
or worse .
happily for european broadcasters , they chose to play it straight and the 48th annual song contest passed off without a hitch . the politics of pop as in every year , voting remained partisan as scandinavian countries supported each other , slavic nations rallied to their neighbors and as large expatriate communities called in to support the act from their homeland . in a sign of geopolitical reconciliation , viewers from both cyprus and greece gave turkey ’ s erener high point totals .
“ for peace on cyprus , ” said the cypriot moderator as he gave turkey ten points .
the turkish north of cyprus has been separated from the greek south ever since turkey invaded to keep the island from joining greece . the british act jemini suffered utter humiliation coming dead last without receiving a single point from the other 25 countries participating .
bbc commentator terry wogan chalked up the result to a “ post iraq backlash . ” many of the british fans in riga agreed with the theory that continental europe had used eurovision to pay britain back for going to war against iraq with the united states . “ i don ’ t think we ’ re particularly liked in europe at the moment , ” one british fan , lee smith said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou germany ’ s entry lou came in a mediocre twelfth place with her motivational speaker motto “ let ’ s get happy ” .
“ i ’ m disappointed .
i wish i could have brought the thing to germany , ” lou told ard television . latvia the real winner despite coming in second to last in the competition , many in latvia feel the small baltic nation was the evenings real winner . after victory in last year ’ s contest in neighboring estonia , riga got the chance to put on the annual competition .
although latvia had to shell out millions of dollars to host eurovision this year , most believe the long-term benefits of having had a global audience will more than offset the investment . latvia , which has spent most of its history under swedish , german or soviet rule and has been independent for only just over a decade , was overjoyed to have the opportunity to market itself . “ it ’ s wonderful for our tourism – -lrb- eurovision -rrb- means that people know where latvia is now , ” said anna muhka from latvian ’ s largest daily newspaper , diena . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happy to sing for germany as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou .

it may not be quite as recognizable as the louvre ’ s glass pyramid in paris , but berlin this weekend gained its own glass and steel treasure with the opening of a new exhibition hall designed by star architect i. m. pei . almost five years after celebrated chinese-born , u.s.-based architect ieoh ming pei wowed berliners with his plans for a small extension to the german historical museum , visitors can finally walk through its spiral glass tower . located at the heart of berlin ’ s historic mitte district , the € 54 million -lrb- $ 64 million -rrb- structure has a massive glass facade that opens out on to the rear of the 300 year-old baroque zeughaus or armory , which today houses the german historical museum . officially opened on friday in the presence of prominent politicians , the 4,700 square meter exhibition hall was hailed by museum director hans ottomeyer as " a perfect design . " best known for his designs of the spectacular glass pyramid at paris ’ louvre museum and the east wing of the national gallery in washington , 86-year-old pei was first awarded the contract eight years ago by former german chancellor helmut kohl .
" all my hopes have been fulfilled , " kohl said in a recent interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect i.m. pei pei -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose teachers included legendary bauhaus masters walter gropius and marcel breuer is one of the most-celebrated architects in contemporary times .
in 1983 he received the prestigious pritzker prize - the equivalent of the nobel prize in architecture . “ architecture should seduce people ” in a recent interview with german newspaper die zeit , pei put his latest creation in context : " the architecture should seduce people to move through the whole building full of curiosity and pleasure .
i even want to tempt them to the top-most floor through ever more steps , new views . " pei also revealed that he had only agreed to designing a relatively small building that would house special exhibitions because the area was dominated by towering architectural wonders by legendary german architect karl friedrich schinkel , the prussia ’ s most famous architect . pei , who has studied schinkel ’ s works and still counts him among his greatest role models , said the project presented him with three challenges : the new building had to be integrated in the classical ensemble around it , it had to be connected with the baroque building of the german historical museum and lastly , it had to be a magnet for visitors . " it ’ s small and yet has to achieve an enormous influence , " pei told die zeit . the new building opens with a temporary exhibition called " the idea of europe : concepts for an eternal peace " which offers a trip through europe from the middle ages to the present .
the spread of christianity , charlemagne ’ s reign and the crusades are some of the highlights . in addition , the museum hosts the first-ever retrospective on ieoh ming pei ’ s life ’ s work , which includes sketches , photographs and models from his work on three continents . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armani collection dresses up berlin museum a new exhibition in berlin explores the career of iconic italian fashion designer giorgio armani .

tony blair has won his battle with gordon brown to keep open the option of holding a referendum on the euro before the next general election , it is reported .

" the key thing that has emerged from the consultation with the cabinet last week is that it has unlocked a clear consensus in favour of keeping open the option of a referendum before the election . "
the announcement on the euro has been widely reported as a source of great tension between mr blair and mr brown .
