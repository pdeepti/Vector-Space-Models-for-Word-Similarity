the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .
diplomats say the iraq mission could follow the successful afghanistan model , in which nato provided technical support to a german-dutch peacekeeping force in kabul . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish government seeking nato help for iraq stability force warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate .
polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq .

a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .

france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .
diplomats say the iraq mission could follow the successful afghanistan model , in which nato provided technical support to a german-dutch peacekeeping force in kabul . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish government seeking nato help for iraq stability force warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .

as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .

after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.05.2003 jil sander returns to fashion fold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimalist sander look works for kate moss .
german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .

france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .
diplomats say the iraq mission could follow the successful afghanistan model , in which nato provided technical support to a german-dutch peacekeeping force in kabul . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish government seeking nato help for iraq stability force warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .
diplomats say the iraq mission could follow the successful afghanistan model , in which nato provided technical support to a german-dutch peacekeeping force in kabul . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish government seeking nato help for iraq stability force warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate .
polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .

the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .

france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .

the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .

many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .

however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.05.2003 jil sander returns to fashion fold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimalist sander look works for kate moss .
german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .

the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .

many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .

prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .
inexperienced substitute shaun maloney blasted a late free kick over the bar when he might have been better off floating it into the square , and the uefa cup was on its way to portugal for the first time in history . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celtic and porto seek to recapture european glory all the background to the uefa cup final between porto and celtic -lrb- may 21 , 2003 -rrb- www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .

in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.05.2003 nato to lend poland a hand in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops from the 4th regiment joined u.s. and british forces fighting in iraq .
the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.05.2003 jil sander returns to fashion fold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimalist sander look works for kate moss .
german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .
" i wanted to change something , i saw it as a mission , " sander once said in an interview .
many hope that she will succeed in doing that for a second time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving fashion a sporting chance after arriving late in the sports fashion craze , adidas has announced a partnership with japanese deisgner yohji yamamoto that it hopes will catapult it ahead of puma and nike .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .
the scots were spurred into action again , and pressed forward in numbers .
three minutes later they were rewarded when larsson headed home his second of the night off an alan thompson corner .
the game continued at a furious pace , punctuated by some wild tackling that saw celtic 's dianbobo balde and porto 's nuno valente booked .
neither would be around for the end of the match , although both were still on the pitch when the regulation 90 minutes were up .
derlei 's " silva " goal extra time brought with it the premiere of uefa 's new " silver goal " ruling , which is being tried out instead of the " golden goal " rule , whereby the first goal scored in extra time automatically ends the game .
under the " silver goal " ruling , if a team is leading after one half of extra time , the match is deemed over , otherwise extra time is played to its conclusion .
the idea is to give a team at least a chance to come back after conceding an extra time goal .
balde was already in the dressing room when the first silver goal in history was scored .
five minutes into extra time , he earned his second yellow card with a lunging challenge on his tormentor derlei .
it proved to be one of the turning points of the match .
both sides began to look tired , and 10-man celtic began to concentrate on defending .
with the last 15 minutes underway , neither team looked particularly dangerous until derlei popped up in the box again and dealt celtic the killer blow .
the portuguese pulled out all the stops to prevent celtic from equalizing , with keeper vitor baia faking injury for at least a minute in the night 's most theatrical performance .
with extra time officially over and four minutes of stoppage time still to go , nuno valente was dismissed for his second bookable offense .
the playing field was level again , at least in a figurative sense , but though celtic dug deep , they could n't find the goal that would level the scores and take the match to penalties .

the 19-member nato alliance has agreed to help poland establish an international peacekeeping contingent in iraq .
military officials meeting behind closed doors in warsaw are ironing out the details . nato members agreed unanimously on wednesday to provide technical support to poland as the country prepares to lead a stabilization force in southern iraq .
the allies took less than a week to respond to poland ’ s request for help .
the decision to support new member poland is seen as a major step in healing the fractious rifts in the alliance that formed over the question of turkey in the lead-up to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers of 3rd platoon ist company of the irish guards , left , escort of a group of iraqi men before checking their identities , friday , march 28 , 2003 in basra .
the men , leaving the city of basra , were subsequently released .
poland has been entrusted by washington with responsibility for a huge swathe of land in south-central iraq between basra and baghdad as a reward for warsaw ’ s strong support of the military campaign that ousted iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
the mission , which will see poland operating alongside british -lrb- photo -rrb- and u.s. forces , is seen as a morale booster for the eastern european country , which joined the alliance just four years ago .
it is estimated that at least 7,000 troops will be needed to secure the peace in the region , which is still marked by looting and lawlessness .
poland does not have sufficient troop strength to go it alone , and is expected to send only between 1,500 and 2,200 of its own soldiers into the region .
troop-pledging on thursday and friday , several nato nations and eastern european countries are meeting at a " troop-pledging " conference in warsaw where the discussions are being held behind closed doors and the nations taking part in the stabilization force are expected to be announced next week .
" this is one of the most important stages in the planning for operations in iraq , " said poland ’ s defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski .
" we have several days of preparations ahead of us before the contingent is complete .
in the end , the decisions will be made in the capitals of the countries that wish to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization of iraq . "
szmajdzinski made sure to chose his words carefully in the wake of a proposal he floated in the american press earlier this month to send a multinational force of germans , danes and poles currently stationed in northwest poland into iraq as a stabilization force .
berlin was not informed and shot down the suggestion immediately .
the polish press , which cites official sources , speculates that spain , italy , bulgaria , romania , albania , lithuania and ukraine could provide troops for the mission .
germany has declined to take part , and it is unlikely that there will be german military forces stationed as peacekeepers in iraq .
a new u.s.-sponsored draft resolution on iraq , which passed the un security council on thursday by a vote of 14 to 0 with syria abstaining , will provide the legal basis for the mission .
healing a wounded alliance diplomats are hailing the recent developments as an important step in healing the pre-war developments that plunged the transatlantic alliance into perhaps the deepest crisis in its 54-year history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo der nato , nato , north atlantic treaty organisation www.nato.int nato found itself bitterly split ahead of the iraq war over the question of bolstering the defenses of its ally turkey .
france , germany and belgium had argued that sending forces to defend turkey was in effect accepting the inevitability of war .
many feared that the fracture had cut into nato ’ s very foundation and some analysts had already began composing the organization ’ s eulogy .
those fears now seem to have faded .
in iraq , nato is expected to provide mainly technical assistance to poland such as setting up headquarters , running communications and sharing intelligence .
the nato flag will not be flown .
however , the decision to come to poland ’ s aid could be an important step towards a larger role in the war-torn country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns gestures while speaking during a television interview at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france , germany and belgium blocked nato efforts to begin planning for possible iraqi attacks against turkey , deepening divisions in the alliance over the u.s.-led push to oust saddam hussein .
" this is a big step forward for the nato alliance , " the organization ’ s u.s. ambassador nicholas burns -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" there is no question that nato is out on the front lines in the global war on terrorism . "
it is largely for that reason that washington has welcomed the nato involvement in iraq , saying it sees the development as a sign of the alliance moving beyond its traditional turf and showing a willingness to tackle far-flung security threats .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .

fc porto 's derlei silva scored a dramatic extra time winner in seville to see off a brave challenge by glasgow celtic and claim the uefa cup on wednesday . the newly-crowned portuguese champions fc porto vindicated the bookies in wednesday 's uefa cup final in seville , but only after an epic two-hour battle with a never-say-die celtic side .
it was a match short on flowing football , but which more than made up for it in passion and drama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto fans celebrate their victory in the streets of oporto .
the portuguese , odds-on favorites going into the match , went ahead twice in normal time , only to see their lead cancelled out within minutes by the resilient scots .
then they did it again with five minutes of extra time left on the clock , and this time , the celts could find no answer .
derlei double fittingly , it was derlei silva who gave celtic the kiss of death , with his second goal of the match and his twelfth of the tournament .
he picked up a loose ball with just five minutes of extra time remaining , and thumped the ball past celtic keeper robert douglas .
one could be forgiven for thinking it would be a home game of sorts for porto , given their home town 's relative proximity to the venue .
but tens of thousands of celtic fans made the trip from scotland , and they appeared to outnumber the portuguese by about three-to-one in the capacity crowd of 52,972 in seville 's estadio olímpico .
at times it sounded as if the game was being played in glasgow .
porto will have been more used to the heat and humidity in the andalusian capital , but that advantage was cancelled out by the poor state of the pitch , which made their usual brand of passing football almost impossible , and suited celtic 's more robust style of play . cagey first half the two sides spent most of a cagey first half sounding each other out , with porto dominating possession but looking far from dangerous in front of goal .
after 45 minutes , it was still goalless , and both sides looked happy to take that scoreline into the dressing rooms with them at half-time .
then derlei struck for the first time .
douglas managed to block a fierce shot from dmitri alenitchev , but the ball fell to derlei and he made no mistake from point blank range .
larsson the leveller the scots came out undaunted after the interval , and seized control of proceedings .
two minutes into the second half , didier agathe showed his pace on the right wing and whipped in a cross to henrik larsson , who headed home his 10th goal of the tournament , and his 200th for celtic .
celtic seemed almost surprised by its quick recovery , and that surprise turned to shock seven minutes later when alenitchev latched onto a delightful through ball from deco to restore the lead .

german fashion icon jil sander , famous for her minimalist style , is making a comeback to the label she left after it was taken over by prada .
dw-world takes a look back at career of a sartorial star . when italy 's prada took over jil sander 's german fashion house in 1999 , the event was hailed in the fashion world as " a marriage made in heaven . "
critics envisaged a fresh new synergy when two fashion heavyweights involved in the luxury goods business joined forces .
" both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of post-modern good taste , " the new york times wrote at the time .
but the honeymoon ended unhappily a year later when sander stepped down as chairwoman after presenting her last spring / winter collection amid rumors that she had come to loggerheads with prada chief executive patrizio bertelli .
now after three years of maintaining a low profile , sander is back with the surprise announcement that she ’ s returning to the company she founded in 1973 .
" jil sander will return to the company she founded , jil sander ag , with immediate effect , " a statement published by prada earlier this week said .
as well as attempting to revive the label 's popularity , which observers say has suffered under the creative direction of her replacement , milan vukmirovic , sander will join prada 's supervisory board .
" ms. sander will sit together with mr. patrizio bertelli and -lrb- his wife -rrb- ms. miucci prada on the strategic committee of prada holding nv , " the company said .
sander 's return good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designer jil sander sander -lrb- photo -rrb- , who turns 60 in november , told german news agency dpa that she looked forward to perfecting the jil sander concept , which prada and analysts hope will restore the flagging company 's future prospects .
" i ’ m very happy about this development , which is positive for both sides , " the publicity-shy sander said .
prada chief patrizio bertelli , who created a furor in germany in 1999 by buying up 75 percent of jil sander ’ s common shares and a large part of its publicly-traded preference shares , has given a cautious welcome to sander ’ s return .
" i am happy that jil has made this important decision , " the italian fashion mogul said in a statement .
" i ’ m sure that she ’ ll find the motivation and the resources in the company that she needs to realize her ideas and creativity . "
bertelli was vague about his reasons for getting back germany ’ s once most-important fashion designer back on board , saying only he was sure the company ’ s fortunes would profit from sander ’ s return .
jil sander ag slipped into the red last year when it made losses of € 26.3 million -lrb- $ 30.78 million -rrb- .
it was the second-straight year of red ink for the company , which clocked up a loss of € 10.7 million the previous year .
" queen of less " dazzles a hamburg native , sander worked as a fashion writer and textile engineer before she opened her own boutique in the upscale hamburg district of pöseldorf in 1968 .
in 1973 she made her debut as a designer with her first women ’ s collection marked by sophisticated and well-cut designs , but suffered a setback on account of production problems .
in the following years , sander made a name with her elegant and simple creations characterized by clean flowing lines .
the international fashion world soon began to take notice of the german designer whose use of expensive fabrics and manufacturing methods left even her simple lightweight sweaters costing much more than other designer collections .
in 1978 , the japanese magazine high fashion included sander among the 12 best designers in the world , while vanity fair dubbed her the " queen of less " for her luxurious minimalism .
" i make fashion for the woman who dresses avant-garde casual , yet does not want to feel -lrb- as though she were -rrb- wearing a costume , " sander said at the time in an interview .
jil sander goes global in 1979 , jil sander ag launched its first cosmetics range , and in the early 1980s sanders began to expand her company on the global market with her range of expensive clothing , accessories and perfumes .
the jil sander collection was exclusively sold in 60 franchises worldwide , more than 250 outlets both within and outside germany and a host of flagship stores in france , italy and north and south america .
in 1989 the company went public on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the first year made a profit of 26.4 million deutsche marks -lrb- € 13.5 million -rrb- .
in 1996 , sander opened new showrooms in a tastefully-restored historic villa in hamburg and in the following year created waves at the milan fashion show with her first men ’ s collection .
what next ?
sander , who is unmarried and rarely speaks about her personal life , is said to enjoy golf and collecting modern art .
she has been honored with the order of merit of the federal republic of germany , the country 's highest civil honor , as well as prestigious fashion awards in paris and munich .

it took two months for mr hadow to trek the 478 miles solo and unsupported from canada .
although conditions are good at the pole , aircraft are unable to take off from eureka weather station on ellesmere island to fetch him because of bad weather .
the explorer , who has had no human contact for the past 66 days , has prepared a landing strip on the ice .
his wife , mary , who has been tracking his progress from their home near hexworthy , dartmoor , said he still hoped to arrive at london heathrow at 0815 bst on bank holiday monday .
he is looking forward to a reunion with his wife and children , wilf , four , and one-year-old freya , both named after explorers .
mrs hadow called her husband " invincible " after he hauled a 330lb -lrb- 148.5 kilogramme -rrb- sledge of food and equipment over constantly moving , cracking sea ice . "
the overwhelming feeling is of utter relief - but i am exhausted , exhausted " pen hadow , record breaker the explorer braved freezing temperatures , swam in the freezing sea and negotiated huge pressure ridges .
as he finished his 477-mile journey , he said : " i 've done it .
" the overwhelming feeling is of utter relief .
but i am exhausted .
exhausted . "
success meant the completion of unfinished business for mr hadow , who runs the polar travel company from his dartmoor home .
