the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest and most of the reforms would not apply until the current european commission steps down in 2009 . dw staff with wire reports . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little bit of the u.s. in the future eu ?

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .
" when you have a trainer for 15 years and then he 's sitting on the bench on the other side , then that 's some special , " said völler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .

in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention .

a " united states of europe " ?
hardly .
though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention . " the eu is progressing at a far slower pace compared to how the us moved towards a federal structure , " said daniel keohane , at the centre for european reform in london .
" the federalist elements of the eu will get more power in the years to come .

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .
members of the fdp , from which he resigned on march 17 , were in shock thursday .
fdp head guido westerwelle said the party 's thoughts were with möllemann 's family .
party colleague gerhart baum speculated that möllemann 's recent fall from grace led to his death .
" i can imagine that he did n't have any more political perspective and feared the start of the investigation -lsb- into him -rsb- , " baum told reporters . former star of the liberals on the day of möllemann 's death state investigators raided his home after the german parliament lifted the protection of immunity .
police are investigating möllemann and five others for fraud and tax evasion . once a star of the liberals in the state of north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous , möllemann left the party in march after a number of scandals . during last year 's election campaign , pro-arab möllemann hurt his party 's chances by distributing campaign leaflets criticizing israel and jewish community leaders in germany . the leaflets came at a time when criticism of israel was a particularly touchy subject in germany .
möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .
the fdp lost votes on election day , ruining their chances of forming a government coalition with the christian democratic union and unseating chancellor gerhard schröder . party leaders held möllemann responsible for their bad results during national elections in september .
he was forced to give up his position as deputy leader of the fdp .
in october , allegations surfaced that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . on march 17 , möllemann resigned from the party rather than undergo a humiliating party investigation .

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .
members of the fdp , from which he resigned on march 17 , were in shock thursday .
fdp head guido westerwelle said the party 's thoughts were with möllemann 's family .
party colleague gerhart baum speculated that möllemann 's recent fall from grace led to his death .
" i can imagine that he did n't have any more political perspective and feared the start of the investigation -lsb- into him -rsb- , " baum told reporters . former star of the liberals on the day of möllemann 's death state investigators raided his home after the german parliament lifted the protection of immunity .
police are investigating möllemann and five others for fraud and tax evasion . once a star of the liberals in the state of north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous , möllemann left the party in march after a number of scandals . during last year 's election campaign , pro-arab möllemann hurt his party 's chances by distributing campaign leaflets criticizing israel and jewish community leaders in germany . the leaflets came at a time when criticism of israel was a particularly touchy subject in germany .
möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .
the fdp lost votes on election day , ruining their chances of forming a government coalition with the christian democratic union and unseating chancellor gerhard schröder . party leaders held möllemann responsible for their bad results during national elections in september .
he was forced to give up his position as deputy leader of the fdp .
in october , allegations surfaced that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . on march 17 , möllemann resigned from the party rather than undergo a humiliating party investigation .
but the former economics minister under chancellor helmut kohl and father of three kept his parliamentary seat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de free democrats vote to oust troublemaker the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .

it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention .

though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention . " the eu is progressing at a far slower pace compared to how the us moved towards a federal structure , " said daniel keohane , at the centre for european reform in london .

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .
members of the fdp , from which he resigned on march 17 , were in shock thursday .
fdp head guido westerwelle said the party 's thoughts were with möllemann 's family .
party colleague gerhart baum speculated that möllemann 's recent fall from grace led to his death .
" i can imagine that he did n't have any more political perspective and feared the start of the investigation -lsb- into him -rsb- , " baum told reporters . former star of the liberals on the day of möllemann 's death state investigators raided his home after the german parliament lifted the protection of immunity .
police are investigating möllemann and five others for fraud and tax evasion . once a star of the liberals in the state of north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous , möllemann left the party in march after a number of scandals . during last year 's election campaign , pro-arab möllemann hurt his party 's chances by distributing campaign leaflets criticizing israel and jewish community leaders in germany . the leaflets came at a time when criticism of israel was a particularly touchy subject in germany .
möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .
the fdp lost votes on election day , ruining their chances of forming a government coalition with the christian democratic union and unseating chancellor gerhard schröder . party leaders held möllemann responsible for their bad results during national elections in september .
he was forced to give up his position as deputy leader of the fdp .
in october , allegations surfaced that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . on march 17 , möllemann resigned from the party rather than undergo a humiliating party investigation .
but the former economics minister under chancellor helmut kohl and father of three kept his parliamentary seat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de free democrats vote to oust troublemaker the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

hardly .
though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention . " the eu is progressing at a far slower pace compared to how the us moved towards a federal structure , " said daniel keohane , at the centre for european reform in london .
" the federalist elements of the eu will get more power in the years to come .
this constitution certainly wo n't be the end of it .

the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .

hardly .
though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .

völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .

though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .

it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest and most of the reforms would not apply until the current european commission steps down in 2009 . dw staff with wire reports . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little bit of the u.s. in the future eu ?

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .

möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .

a " united states of europe " ?
hardly .
though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention . " the eu is progressing at a far slower pace compared to how the us moved towards a federal structure , " said daniel keohane , at the centre for european reform in london .
" the federalist elements of the eu will get more power in the years to come .
this constitution certainly wo n't be the end of it .

but the former french president is not without his critics .

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .
members of the fdp , from which he resigned on march 17 , were in shock thursday .
fdp head guido westerwelle said the party 's thoughts were with möllemann 's family .
party colleague gerhart baum speculated that möllemann 's recent fall from grace led to his death .
" i can imagine that he did n't have any more political perspective and feared the start of the investigation -lsb- into him -rsb- , " baum told reporters . former star of the liberals on the day of möllemann 's death state investigators raided his home after the german parliament lifted the protection of immunity .
police are investigating möllemann and five others for fraud and tax evasion . once a star of the liberals in the state of north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous , möllemann left the party in march after a number of scandals . during last year 's election campaign , pro-arab möllemann hurt his party 's chances by distributing campaign leaflets criticizing israel and jewish community leaders in germany . the leaflets came at a time when criticism of israel was a particularly touchy subject in germany .
möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .
the fdp lost votes on election day , ruining their chances of forming a government coalition with the christian democratic union and unseating chancellor gerhard schröder . party leaders held möllemann responsible for their bad results during national elections in september .
he was forced to give up his position as deputy leader of the fdp .
in october , allegations surfaced that he maintained illegal party bank accounts to the tune of € 1.5 million -lrb- $ 1.48 million -rrb- . on march 17 , möllemann resigned from the party rather than undergo a humiliating party investigation .
but the former economics minister under chancellor helmut kohl and father of three kept his parliamentary seat . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de free democrats vote to oust troublemaker the fdp launches proceedings to expel a notorious publicity-seeker in the wake of the central role he played in a campaign finance scandal and offensive campaign leaflet .

völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .

“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .

he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .

european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers .

the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .
" when you have a trainer for 15 years and then he 's sitting on the bench on the other side , then that 's some special , " said völler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest and most of the reforms would not apply until the current european commission steps down in 2009 . dw staff with wire reports . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little bit of the u.s. in the future eu ?

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .

hardly .
though the drafters of the new european constitution may borrow inspiration from america 's founding fathers , their work is an entirely different animal . the bedside reading of the man responsible for leading the drafting of the new european constitution was the biography of one of america 's great political philosophers . the lawyer , thinker and one-time u.s. president john adams was a champion of the 1776 declaration of independence , which set the united states on the path to the drafting of its first constitution ten years later .
european union convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is nearing the completion of a similar political journey right now , heading a 105-member convention charged with drafting the document that will define an expanded europe 's future . in speeches , d 'estaing , a former french president , often invokes the work the u.s. draftsmen carried out in the hot summer of 1787 . at the same time , the 77-year-old frenchman makes clear that the relatively modest goals of the european union are clearly different from the original intentions of the united states ' founding fathers . " our aims are not as grand as theirs : we are not building a nation , " d 'estaing said in a speech introducing the first draft of the eu convention earlier this year . fledgling country vs. established power the white-wigged delegates drafting the u.s. constitution in 1787 wanted to lay the foundation for a powerful and unified country that would hold a prominent place on the world stage .
for its part , the european union is already powerful - with an economic might rivalling the united states - and it is an established member of the international community . " this is not a convention about something fundamental , in a substantive sense , the way the american constitution was , which aimed at making it defensible and economically viable in a hostile world , " said andrew moravcsik , professor of government and director of the european union program at harvard university in a dw-world interview . still , it is n't without its complexities , either .
in the words of giscard d 'estaing , the task facing the drafters is trickier . " we are a europe of many nations , and with strikingly disparate dimensions , territorial , demographic , wealth and living standards , " he said in a recent speech .
the differences will become only more obvious when the union expands in 2004 to include countries from the baltic coast to the mediterranean sea .
who 's got the power ? as during the summer of ' 87 , the convention is addressing important issues of whether to centralize the power of the european union , or to maintain the system of checks and balances that give the union 's national governments the option of going their own way on issues such as foreign policy or defense . america 's founding fathers decided to take the former route .
the federal government in washington took charge of the country 's foreign policy , trade and defense . the states , meanwhile , were given the responsibility of caring for their internal prosperity , ceding say on america 's role in the greater world to a federal government .
the eu , in giscard d 'estaing 's words , plans to do just the opposite .
the division over america 's military invasion of iraq highlighted the strong belief the eu states such as great britain and germany have in exercising their sovereignty on the international stage .
it is only in areas of economic integration and the common currency the euro that the eu capital in brussels holds sway . making the eu make sense if first drafts are any indication , there will be little substantive change to the way the european union functions and works .
the intention of the convention is to streamline and clearly define the role of the eu 's various institutions , not get mired in the grander visions of federalism that dominated philadelphia convention . " the eu is progressing at a far slower pace compared to how the us moved towards a federal structure , " said daniel keohane , at the centre for european reform in london .

a disgraced former leader of germany 's liberals , jürgen w. möllemann , died thursday in a parachuting accident .
police said his death , which came on the same day as an investigation against him , was apparently a suicide . investigators said that disgraced former politician jürgen möllemann who died in a parachute accident on thursday most likely killed himself . eyewitnesses told german television that möllemann , a former army parachutist , opened the parachute and then cut it free from his body before plummeting to the ground .
a spokesman for local investigators told reporters they believe he committed suicide , but would n't release further details .
the 57-year-old former deputy leader of germany 's liberal free democratic party , was married and the father of three daughters . " regardless of all the differences in political opinion , i extend my condolences to his family , " said german interior minister otto schily .
members of the fdp , from which he resigned on march 17 , were in shock thursday .
fdp head guido westerwelle said the party 's thoughts were with möllemann 's family .
party colleague gerhart baum speculated that möllemann 's recent fall from grace led to his death .
" i can imagine that he did n't have any more political perspective and feared the start of the investigation -lsb- into him -rsb- , " baum told reporters . former star of the liberals on the day of möllemann 's death state investigators raided his home after the german parliament lifted the protection of immunity .
police are investigating möllemann and five others for fraud and tax evasion . once a star of the liberals in the state of north-rhine westphalia , germany 's most populous , möllemann left the party in march after a number of scandals . during last year 's election campaign , pro-arab möllemann hurt his party 's chances by distributing campaign leaflets criticizing israel and jewish community leaders in germany . the leaflets came at a time when criticism of israel was a particularly touchy subject in germany .
möllemann had rocked the boat earlier in the year by criticizing a leading german jewish figure , saying his " intolerant and hateful style " was responsible for the rise in anti-semitism in germany . the campaign stunt was characteristic of the colorful and no-holds barred politician , who would parachute into campaign events in the yellow-and-blue colors of the fdp . held responsible for vote loss but it was not well received by voters or his party .

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .

the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .

the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit . after an ugly week of diplomatic wrangling , the chairman of the constitutional convention , former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , said on friday that “ a basis for a final consensus ” on a new draft had been found . on june 20 , eu leaders are to meet in greece to give their blessing to a draft european constitution enabling the bloc to function when it expands from 15 to 25 members next year .
when the 105-member constitutional convention last month presented its latest working text , it was immediately attacked on several fronts . whereas smaller eu members and candidate countries complained the draft amounted to a power grab by the largest european nations , other member states feared the constitution was too federalist and integrationist .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin on thursday evening said the convention was in the midst of a crisis . “ some might be content with a minimal compromise but we won ’ t be , ” said de villepin .
“ no constitution for europe is still better than a bad comprise . ” ending the rotating presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council , which is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently the eu presidency is rotated every six months with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries complain this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new draft constitution also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . with the summit in greece looming , the convention presidium , led by giscard , has come under immense pressure to hammer out a deal acceptable to all sides .
on friday , german presidium member elmar brok said momentum for a compromise was building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are on a good way to consensus .
everything is moving in the right direction , " said brok , a christian democrat member of the european parliament , according to the reuters news agency . limiting the president 's power brok said the 13 members of the convention presidium had come to agreement on how to handle the issue of the european council president .
he said the president 's powers would be limited , in a concession to small nations and the executive european commission that fear the position might be too powerful . trying to balance conflicting interests , the latest compromise would forbid the president from interfering in the work of the commission chief or of a planned new eu foreign minister .
but in an important change , the president could be a member of another eu institution , clearing the way for the possible fusion in the future of the posts of president of the european council and of the commission – a tip to eu federalists . the new deal also will keep giscard ’ s preferred voting system , which would allow most eu decision-making to be done by majority voting , whereby at least half of the member states representing at least 60 percent of the eu 's total population backed an issue . after the draft is presented to europe ’ s leaders in greece , eu governments will have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest and most of the reforms would not apply until the current european commission steps down in 2009 . dw staff with wire reports . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a little bit of the u.s. in the future eu ?

germany 's former national soccer trainer berti vogts , now coaching scotland , will face on his former team this weekend in an important european cup qualification match . one of germany 's most successful national coaches will face one of his former players on saturday , as berti vogts ' scotland takes on rudi völler 's world cup runners-up germany in the european cup qualifier . the two sides share the top position in the four-team group with lithuania , which has surprised with a wins against the faroe islands and scotland and a tie with germany .
völler 's side is charging for a win in order to put them at top of the group rankings , hopefully all the way through to the end of qualification in october . scotland is vying for the second spot in the group , and would love a win or tie against germany before an expected 52,000 fans in glasgow to help them keep pace with lithuania . " we plan to play very scottish , " said vogts , who was german national team trainer from 1990 to 1998 .
" that means with fight and passion .
the germans will have to work hard for a win . " ballack injured they might have to work even harder should star midfielder michael ballack succumb to a bothersome calf injury .
ballack , who has sat out national games since november because of injury , planned to play saturday .
recent reports , however , suggest his injury might be worse than originally thought .
the injury is one of many on the team , with each of völler 's three fullbacks still hampered by various ailments . the players remain optimistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : völler -lrb- left -rrb- and ballack -lrb- right -rrb- " michael is of course a very important player for us , " said bayern munich midfielder jens jeremies .
" but if he does n't play , we ca n't use that as an excuse if we do n't win . " the presence of vogts on the other sideline in glasgow on saturday has whipped the tabloid press into a frenzy .
though " mcberti " won the european cup with germany in 1996 and has more victories overall than völler , he does n't enjoy his former striker 's popularity among german fans and press . " völler wants to blow away berti and his bagpipes , " wrote the mass-circulation bild this week . but the pair have dismissed any whiff of rivalry .
as völler 's trainer on the u-21 team and later on the national team , völler built up a good relationship with vogts .
" when you have a trainer for 15 years and then he 's sitting on the bench on the other side , then that 's some special , " said völler . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german bundesliga season wrap-up german soccer powerhouse bayern munich was crowned champion of the bundesliga ages ago , but the end of the season this weekend still had plenty of first-division action on offer .

under the treaty , both australia and the new nation of east timor , which got independence from indonesia in 2002 , will get income from the gas finds .
signs are already emerging of huge potential earnings .
offshore gas explorers have to lay out massive investments to build rigs out in the sea , costs which mean buyers for the gas have to be found before the rig building starts .
long-term commitment in the bayu-undan field , 500 kilometres off the north coast of australia , building is finally underway as project operator conocophillips has at last found a customer for liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- from the field .
" what happens in the lng market is that people do n't make investments until they find a buyer , " says conoco 's darwin vice president blair murphy .
" so we need to find a buyer to commit to these projects for 17 , 20 , 30 years before we commit to the project , " he explains .
the ratification of the timor sea gas treaty enabled conocophillips to sign on the dotted line to confirm supply contracts with tokyo electric gas .
well-head platforms are now being towed into place , the first step towards extracting some of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas stranded here .
giant investment the scale of the bayu-undan project is considerable .
at least $ 1bn -lrb- £ 600m -rrb- has already gone into building gas rigs for the timor sea .
stage two is a pipeline to darwin .
and then there 's the mainland infrastructure to think about .
east timor hopes gas earnings can ease poverty in three years time the muddy peninsula of wickham point will have been transformed into a $ 1.5bn dollar lng processing plant .
at the moment all you see at the site is a road to nowhere .
the $ 4m transport corridor being pushed through the mangrove swamp will be the backbone of darwin 's gas development project .
but that is not the end of the story .
there 's another gas field in the timor sea .
sunrise is three times the size of bayu-undan but in 25 years nobody has yet worked out how to make its development viable .
clare martin , chief minister of australia 's northern territory , hopes that is about to change .
more to come ?
" my belief is that sunrise and how it will be developed will be greatly influenced by the first gas coming onshore from bayu-undan , " she says .
" once the pipe is built from bayu-undan i do believe that it changes the way that joint ventures in sunrise will look at how you exploit the resource . "
the issue of how to split sunrise 's future royalties was the major sticking point holding up ratification of the timor sea treaty .
with that now resolved , the way is clear for gas explorers to look again at sunrise 's potential .

whether euthanasia is right has prompted much discussion , and a bill on the issue is currently passing through parliament .
lord joffe 's bill on assisted dying will have its second reading in the house of lords today .
we heard from liz sayce from the disability rights commission who is opposed to the bill click here to see our interview with liz sayce we also spoke brian pretty who campaigned for his wife diane to be allowed to die at home and lesley close whose brother suffered from motor neurone disease click here to see our interview with brian pretty and lesley close and breakfast 's graham satchell has been to guernsey where the parliament there is looking at the possibility of legalising euthanasia .
click here to see graham satchell 's film and we want to know what your think .
is it right to help someone die ? click here to e-mail us with your views lord joffe 's patient assisted dying bill will have its second reading in the lords today .
the bill would allow a terminally ill adult make a considered request for medical assistance to die and give them a legal right to maximum pain control .
the issue has been in the news following the cases of diane pretty who had fought for a change in the law .
a handful of other people have turned to a clinic in switzerland .
in january 74-year-old reginald crew from liverpool travelled there for help to die .
in april a british couple , robert and jennifer stokes , died at a swiss clinic following an apparent suicide pact .
and last month , john close died at the swiss dignitas clinic .
what the bill proposes if the bill became law , a " competent " adult who is suffering unbearably from a terminal or serious incurable physical illness would need two doctors to confirm the diagnosis and ensure all alternatives have been considered .
a solicitor would then need to confirm the patient 's wishes and a cooling off period would follow so that the patient would have time to consider his decision further .
diane pretty diane pretty 's case has advanced the legal , medical and ethical debate .
she lost her case in britain and at the european court of human rights but the echr left a " margin of appreciation " for individual member states of the eu for judicial review .
diane 's husband brian supports the bill .
he and diane fought for this as she just wanted to die at home with her friends and family .
she did n't want to go somewhere she did n't know to die .
he understands all the arguments about the need for safeguards but thinks this can be accommodated within the law - of course vulnerable people need to be protected .
do you think it 's right to help someone end their life ?

one of britain 's leading gm scientists , based in kent , says without gm , fruit farms and orchards across the county could disappear and eventually only imported fruit will be available .
professor david james has been experimenting with genetic modification in fruit for nearly 20 years .
based at horticulture research international in east malling he has found ways to extend the shelf life of apples , control tree size and prevent mould in strawberries .

of the orchards in kent , 30 % have disappeared in recent years .
professor james has warned that failure to implement modern genetic improvements could lead to the further undermining of the apple industry and see the further grubbing up of orchards in favour of cereal plantings .
the soil association disagrees as it has said traditional breeding methods can be used to grow improved fruit , such as mould resistant strawberries .
it adds that this along with increasing organic production will help ensure the survival of the county 's growers .
it is all part of a debate which will reach its climax in the autumn when the government decides whether or not to grow genetically modified crops commercially .

persimmon extended its presence in the county by snapping up local builder merewood .
the £ 22.6m deal hands persimmon an extra land bank of more than 1,000 building plots .
the kendal-based merewood group , which operates as merewood homes and crowther homes across cumbria , is to be rebranded and integrated into persimmon 's existing operation .
persimmon 's chief executive john white said : " this transaction provides us with over 1,000 additional plots in an area where we were seeking to expand our operations .
" the majority of the land is either currently being developed or is ready for immediate use .
" it has been purchased at better prices than are currently available on the open market . "
in 2002 merewood , which employs 70 people , generated revenues of £ 35.4m , building 281 homes which sold for an average price of £ 126,000 .
the enlarged operation will effectively double persimmon 's local output , which currently builds around 300 properties a year .
the deal will also save overhead costs drawing on persimmon 's purchasing power and product range .
the # 22.6 million price tag , which includes around # 9 million of debt , has been funded by persimmon 's existing banking facilities .

the company said that demand for new houses was outstripping supply .
we 're still seeing house prices rise in many areas but they 're not as dramatic as they were last year duncan davidson persimmon and with interest rates at low levels it said there was no sign of a decline .
persimmon 's profits rose by nearly two-thirds to £ 111.8m -lrb- $ 170.7m -rrb- in the first six months of the year .

" quite frankly we 're pleased about that because the increases that we were seeing last year were really getting pretty high by our reckoning , " he added .
mr davidson said he thought that prices for his company 's new homes would rise by about 10 or 11 % over 2002 .
persimmon took over its rival , beazer last year , and its other brands include charles church .
latest figures for the whole of the uk housing market show that house prices have slowed .
the research group hometrack found that the average uk house price rose by just 0.7 % in august .
