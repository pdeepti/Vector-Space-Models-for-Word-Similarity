the latest in a string of run-ins involves the german government ’ s plans to impose a new toll on trucks traversing german autobahns , slated to come into operation by august 31 this year .
eu : berlin scheme could violate fair play on wednesday the european commission opened a formal review of the system amid fears the german government ’ s plans to provide € 600 million -lrb- $ 684.3 million -rrb- in tax rebates to the country ’ s truckers who refuel in germany may constitute illegal state aid .
the commission believes the move could favor domestic companies over competitors from other eu countries .
" in principle the german truck toll can not start until we have finished our negotiations , " eu commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , said in brussels .
gilles gantelet , a spokesman for de palacio stressed , " we are of the opinion that germany should attempt to put the system on hold . "
the eu commission has said its review of the german case could take up to a year .
though it remains unclear what steps the eu commission might take should germany fail to postpone its truck toll , sources in the commission are reported to have said the matter could go as far as the european court of justice .
berlin says it 's playing by the rules berlin , however , is sticking to its stance despite the commission ’ s threats .
german transport minister manfred stolpe has pointed out the implementation of the road toll system – an average of 12.4 cents per kilometer depending on truck size and level of emissions which germany hopes will yield annual revenues of € 2.8 billion – is not in danger .
" the german government is going to do anything it can to convince brussels that the regulation is in line with eu law , " the minister said on thursday in berlin .
stolpe said the planned tax rebates amounting to € 600 million were meant to harmonize practices between truckers who buy fuel in germany , where it is highly taxed to help subsidize the environment and road system , and those who fill-up in lower-tax countries .
he emphasized the rebates would be paid to all transport companies that pay the autobahn toll and buy fuel in germany , regardless of their country of origin .
the eu commission is concerned that non-german trucking companies have had problems obtaining the transponders , which monitor their travel on the autobahns .
however , the german government has said it is paying € 650 million to a private transport consortium to set up and operate satellite-monitored on-board systems in trucks well before the august 31 deadline .
the first of its kind satellite system will use automatic toll-tracking devices built over the roadway at regular intervals to check whether drivers have activated their on-board systems .
trucks without the systems will be able to pay at gas stations .
berlin probe coincides with eu 's own road toll plan the eu commission ’ s probe of the berlin case was launched at the same time brussels unveiled its own proposals for a european system of road-charging for commercial vehicles in an attempt to ease the growing problem of road congestion and open up new sources for funding transport infrastructure .
the commission wants berlin to hold off on the introduction of its road toll system to allow it to examine its pan-eu scheme proposed by de palacio .
the plans , which will allow member states to spend a share of the proceeds from road tolls on rail links for the first time , would apply to some 60,000 kilometers of trans-european roads and are part of a wider drive to boost europe ’ s transport infrastructure .
at present eu countries can only levy charges that reflect the cost of building and maintaining motorways and are not allowed to " cross-subsidize " by charging road users to pay for railways .
" we are not trying to penalize road transport , we are trying to encourage other forms , " de palacio said at a press conference in brussels this week .
" if you start beating the road lobby , you ’ re going to undermine the competitiveness in europe and lose jobs .
we want everything to work , " she emphasized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled times for telekom the european commission started anti-trust proceedings against deutsche telekom on wednesday .

the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .
the era of chaotic bargain counters and endless lines at the check-out will soon be over . for almost a century , normally under-control germans entered a two-week phase of shopping madness two times a year .
the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .

u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .
11 attacks .
the report accuses germany of not having taken the threat of terror seriously enough . an explosive joint report released by the united states congress on thursday heavily criticizes the fbi and cia for failing to prevent the sept .
11 terrorist attacks despite intelligence information that could have tipped them off .
the report also suggested that restrictive german laws may have prevented the earlier discovery of the hamburg al qaeda cell responsible for the attacks .
the report 's authors complained that u.s. and even german intelligence agencies failed to identify what it described as a growing threat of terrorism in the years leading up to sept .
11 .
it accused cia director george tenet of being " either unwilling or unable to marshal the full range of intelligence community resources necessary to combat the growing threat . "
in its most damning assessments , the over 800-page report accused the fbi and cia of failing to communicate with each other at critical times and of ignoring or responding too slowly to signs of terrorist threats .
congressional investigators further alleged that the agencies failed to translate conversations between suspected terrorists and missed a number of chances to foil the plot to hijack planes and use them as bombs to destroy the world trade center and the pentagon .
" significant legal barriers " the report went on to criticize germany for restrictive laws that made cooperation between intelligence agencies difficult .
" significant legal barriers restricted germany 's ability to target islamic fundamentalism , " the report stated .
" before sept .
11 , it was not illegal in germany to be a member of a foreign terrorist organization , to raise funds for terrorists , or plan a terrorist attack outside germany . "
the report noted that germany 's intelligence apparatus " was deliberately fragmented to make abuses of power more difficult .

the latest in a string of run-ins involves the german government ’ s plans to impose a new toll on trucks traversing german autobahns , slated to come into operation by august 31 this year .
eu : berlin scheme could violate fair play on wednesday the european commission opened a formal review of the system amid fears the german government ’ s plans to provide € 600 million -lrb- $ 684.3 million -rrb- in tax rebates to the country ’ s truckers who refuel in germany may constitute illegal state aid .
the commission believes the move could favor domestic companies over competitors from other eu countries .
" in principle the german truck toll can not start until we have finished our negotiations , " eu commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , said in brussels .
gilles gantelet , a spokesman for de palacio stressed , " we are of the opinion that germany should attempt to put the system on hold . "
the eu commission has said its review of the german case could take up to a year .
though it remains unclear what steps the eu commission might take should germany fail to postpone its truck toll , sources in the commission are reported to have said the matter could go as far as the european court of justice .
berlin says it 's playing by the rules berlin , however , is sticking to its stance despite the commission ’ s threats .
german transport minister manfred stolpe has pointed out the implementation of the road toll system – an average of 12.4 cents per kilometer depending on truck size and level of emissions which germany hopes will yield annual revenues of € 2.8 billion – is not in danger .
" the german government is going to do anything it can to convince brussels that the regulation is in line with eu law , " the minister said on thursday in berlin .
stolpe said the planned tax rebates amounting to € 600 million were meant to harmonize practices between truckers who buy fuel in germany , where it is highly taxed to help subsidize the environment and road system , and those who fill-up in lower-tax countries .
he emphasized the rebates would be paid to all transport companies that pay the autobahn toll and buy fuel in germany , regardless of their country of origin .
the eu commission is concerned that non-german trucking companies have had problems obtaining the transponders , which monitor their travel on the autobahns .
however , the german government has said it is paying € 650 million to a private transport consortium to set up and operate satellite-monitored on-board systems in trucks well before the august 31 deadline .
the first of its kind satellite system will use automatic toll-tracking devices built over the roadway at regular intervals to check whether drivers have activated their on-board systems .
trucks without the systems will be able to pay at gas stations .
berlin probe coincides with eu 's own road toll plan the eu commission ’ s probe of the berlin case was launched at the same time brussels unveiled its own proposals for a european system of road-charging for commercial vehicles in an attempt to ease the growing problem of road congestion and open up new sources for funding transport infrastructure .
the commission wants berlin to hold off on the introduction of its road toll system to allow it to examine its pan-eu scheme proposed by de palacio .
the plans , which will allow member states to spend a share of the proceeds from road tolls on rail links for the first time , would apply to some 60,000 kilometers of trans-european roads and are part of a wider drive to boost europe ’ s transport infrastructure .
at present eu countries can only levy charges that reflect the cost of building and maintaining motorways and are not allowed to " cross-subsidize " by charging road users to pay for railways .
" we are not trying to penalize road transport , we are trying to encourage other forms , " de palacio said at a press conference in brussels this week .
" if you start beating the road lobby , you ’ re going to undermine the competitiveness in europe and lose jobs .
we want everything to work , " she emphasized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled times for telekom the european commission started anti-trust proceedings against deutsche telekom on wednesday .

the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .
the era of chaotic bargain counters and endless lines at the check-out will soon be over . for almost a century , normally under-control germans entered a two-week phase of shopping madness two times a year .
the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .
he relished the two-week limited nature of things .
“ like at the opera , you need an overture and a good ending . ”
germany ’ s main consumer protection organization , however , and many retailers welcome the change , which they consider overdue .
“ customers are responsible and old enough -lsb- to handle the change -rsb- , ” said thomas körner , manager at the karstadt chain of department stores .
one of his colleagues , however , was not so quick to dismiss almost a century of tradition .
“ no matter what happens , ” he said , “ the closeout sales are going to stay in the minds of our customers . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.

the latest in a string of run-ins involves the german government ’ s plans to impose a new toll on trucks traversing german autobahns , slated to come into operation by august 31 this year .
eu : berlin scheme could violate fair play on wednesday the european commission opened a formal review of the system amid fears the german government ’ s plans to provide € 600 million -lrb- $ 684.3 million -rrb- in tax rebates to the country ’ s truckers who refuel in germany may constitute illegal state aid .
the commission believes the move could favor domestic companies over competitors from other eu countries .
" in principle the german truck toll can not start until we have finished our negotiations , " eu commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , said in brussels .
gilles gantelet , a spokesman for de palacio stressed , " we are of the opinion that germany should attempt to put the system on hold . "
the eu commission has said its review of the german case could take up to a year .
though it remains unclear what steps the eu commission might take should germany fail to postpone its truck toll , sources in the commission are reported to have said the matter could go as far as the european court of justice .
berlin says it 's playing by the rules berlin , however , is sticking to its stance despite the commission ’ s threats .
german transport minister manfred stolpe has pointed out the implementation of the road toll system – an average of 12.4 cents per kilometer depending on truck size and level of emissions which germany hopes will yield annual revenues of € 2.8 billion – is not in danger .
" the german government is going to do anything it can to convince brussels that the regulation is in line with eu law , " the minister said on thursday in berlin .
stolpe said the planned tax rebates amounting to € 600 million were meant to harmonize practices between truckers who buy fuel in germany , where it is highly taxed to help subsidize the environment and road system , and those who fill-up in lower-tax countries .
he emphasized the rebates would be paid to all transport companies that pay the autobahn toll and buy fuel in germany , regardless of their country of origin .
the eu commission is concerned that non-german trucking companies have had problems obtaining the transponders , which monitor their travel on the autobahns .
however , the german government has said it is paying € 650 million to a private transport consortium to set up and operate satellite-monitored on-board systems in trucks well before the august 31 deadline .
the first of its kind satellite system will use automatic toll-tracking devices built over the roadway at regular intervals to check whether drivers have activated their on-board systems .
trucks without the systems will be able to pay at gas stations .
berlin probe coincides with eu 's own road toll plan the eu commission ’ s probe of the berlin case was launched at the same time brussels unveiled its own proposals for a european system of road-charging for commercial vehicles in an attempt to ease the growing problem of road congestion and open up new sources for funding transport infrastructure .
the commission wants berlin to hold off on the introduction of its road toll system to allow it to examine its pan-eu scheme proposed by de palacio .
the plans , which will allow member states to spend a share of the proceeds from road tolls on rail links for the first time , would apply to some 60,000 kilometers of trans-european roads and are part of a wider drive to boost europe ’ s transport infrastructure .
at present eu countries can only levy charges that reflect the cost of building and maintaining motorways and are not allowed to " cross-subsidize " by charging road users to pay for railways .
" we are not trying to penalize road transport , we are trying to encourage other forms , " de palacio said at a press conference in brussels this week .
" if you start beating the road lobby , you ’ re going to undermine the competitiveness in europe and lose jobs .
we want everything to work , " she emphasized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled times for telekom the european commission started anti-trust proceedings against deutsche telekom on wednesday .

the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .
the era of chaotic bargain counters and endless lines at the check-out will soon be over . for almost a century , normally under-control germans entered a two-week phase of shopping madness two times a year .
the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .
he relished the two-week limited nature of things .
“ like at the opera , you need an overture and a good ending . ”
germany ’ s main consumer protection organization , however , and many retailers welcome the change , which they consider overdue .
“ customers are responsible and old enough -lsb- to handle the change -rsb- , ” said thomas körner , manager at the karstadt chain of department stores .
one of his colleagues , however , was not so quick to dismiss almost a century of tradition .
“ no matter what happens , ” he said , “ the closeout sales are going to stay in the minds of our customers . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.

the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .
he relished the two-week limited nature of things .
“ like at the opera , you need an overture and a good ending . ”
germany ’ s main consumer protection organization , however , and many retailers welcome the change , which they consider overdue .
“ customers are responsible and old enough -lsb- to handle the change -rsb- , ” said thomas körner , manager at the karstadt chain of department stores .

u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .
11 attacks .
the report accuses germany of not having taken the threat of terror seriously enough . an explosive joint report released by the united states congress on thursday heavily criticizes the fbi and cia for failing to prevent the sept .
11 terrorist attacks despite intelligence information that could have tipped them off .
the report also suggested that restrictive german laws may have prevented the earlier discovery of the hamburg al qaeda cell responsible for the attacks .
the report 's authors complained that u.s. and even german intelligence agencies failed to identify what it described as a growing threat of terrorism in the years leading up to sept .
11 .
it accused cia director george tenet of being " either unwilling or unable to marshal the full range of intelligence community resources necessary to combat the growing threat . "
in its most damning assessments , the over 800-page report accused the fbi and cia of failing to communicate with each other at critical times and of ignoring or responding too slowly to signs of terrorist threats .
congressional investigators further alleged that the agencies failed to translate conversations between suspected terrorists and missed a number of chances to foil the plot to hijack planes and use them as bombs to destroy the world trade center and the pentagon .
" significant legal barriers " the report went on to criticize germany for restrictive laws that made cooperation between intelligence agencies difficult .
" significant legal barriers restricted germany 's ability to target islamic fundamentalism , " the report stated .
" before sept .
11 , it was not illegal in germany to be a member of a foreign terrorist organization , to raise funds for terrorists , or plan a terrorist attack outside germany . "
the report noted that germany 's intelligence apparatus " was deliberately fragmented to make abuses of power more difficult .
this fragmentation also made coordination and information sharing more difficult . "
it also concluded the german government " apparently did not consider islamic groups a threat and were unwilling to devote significant investigative resources to this target -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- . "
in the report , the assistant director of the american fbi 's counterterrorism division is quoted saying that " the germans were so restrictive prior to sept .
11 with their constitution about what they can and can not do , that they could do very little . "
security laws tightened the discovery that three of the sept .
11 terrorists lived in hamburg and may have planned the attacks while in the country deeply shook german officials , who quickly pushed for the tightening of laws to make it easier to investigate and take action against those suspected of having ties to terrorist organizations .
just months after the terrorist attacks , germany 's parliament approved legislation that made it possible for the government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state , led by turkish-born metin kaplan , and al aqsa , the fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
since the law ’ s passage in 2001 , 16 islamic groups have been banned in germany .
the country has also embarked on the largest investigation in its postwar history - a probe that won the praise of the state department in its latest anti-terrorism report in may 2003 .
more than 600 officers from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and the fbi probed the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigation has already led to two trials and the conviction of mounir al motassadeq , a moroccan student who associated with and provided financial support for the terror cell . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state department praises german anti-terror efforts in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell .

u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .
11 attacks .
the report accuses germany of not having taken the threat of terror seriously enough . an explosive joint report released by the united states congress on thursday heavily criticizes the fbi and cia for failing to prevent the sept .
11 terrorist attacks despite intelligence information that could have tipped them off .
the report also suggested that restrictive german laws may have prevented the earlier discovery of the hamburg al qaeda cell responsible for the attacks .
the report 's authors complained that u.s. and even german intelligence agencies failed to identify what it described as a growing threat of terrorism in the years leading up to sept .
11 .
it accused cia director george tenet of being " either unwilling or unable to marshal the full range of intelligence community resources necessary to combat the growing threat . "
in its most damning assessments , the over 800-page report accused the fbi and cia of failing to communicate with each other at critical times and of ignoring or responding too slowly to signs of terrorist threats .
congressional investigators further alleged that the agencies failed to translate conversations between suspected terrorists and missed a number of chances to foil the plot to hijack planes and use them as bombs to destroy the world trade center and the pentagon .
" significant legal barriers " the report went on to criticize germany for restrictive laws that made cooperation between intelligence agencies difficult .
" significant legal barriers restricted germany 's ability to target islamic fundamentalism , " the report stated .
" before sept .
11 , it was not illegal in germany to be a member of a foreign terrorist organization , to raise funds for terrorists , or plan a terrorist attack outside germany . "
the report noted that germany 's intelligence apparatus " was deliberately fragmented to make abuses of power more difficult .
this fragmentation also made coordination and information sharing more difficult . "
it also concluded the german government " apparently did not consider islamic groups a threat and were unwilling to devote significant investigative resources to this target -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- . "
in the report , the assistant director of the american fbi 's counterterrorism division is quoted saying that " the germans were so restrictive prior to sept .
11 with their constitution about what they can and can not do , that they could do very little . "
security laws tightened the discovery that three of the sept .
11 terrorists lived in hamburg and may have planned the attacks while in the country deeply shook german officials , who quickly pushed for the tightening of laws to make it easier to investigate and take action against those suspected of having ties to terrorist organizations .
just months after the terrorist attacks , germany 's parliament approved legislation that made it possible for the government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals , commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries .
the law enabled the interior ministry to ban the extremist islamic organization known as the caliphate state , led by turkish-born metin kaplan , and al aqsa , the fundraising arm of the middle east terrorist group hamas .
since the law ’ s passage in 2001 , 16 islamic groups have been banned in germany .
the country has also embarked on the largest investigation in its postwar history - a probe that won the praise of the state department in its latest anti-terrorism report in may 2003 .
more than 600 officers from the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- and the fbi probed the roots of the hamburg al qaeda cell .
the investigation has already led to two trials and the conviction of mounir al motassadeq , a moroccan student who associated with and provided financial support for the terror cell . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de state department praises german anti-terror efforts in its latest report on the state of global terror , washington praises berlin for its successful initiatives in fighting islamic extremists and investigating the roots of the 9/11 hamburg terror cell .

the latest in a string of run-ins involves the german government ’ s plans to impose a new toll on trucks traversing german autobahns , slated to come into operation by august 31 this year .
eu : berlin scheme could violate fair play on wednesday the european commission opened a formal review of the system amid fears the german government ’ s plans to provide € 600 million -lrb- $ 684.3 million -rrb- in tax rebates to the country ’ s truckers who refuel in germany may constitute illegal state aid .
the commission believes the move could favor domestic companies over competitors from other eu countries .
" in principle the german truck toll can not start until we have finished our negotiations , " eu commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , said in brussels .
gilles gantelet , a spokesman for de palacio stressed , " we are of the opinion that germany should attempt to put the system on hold . "
the eu commission has said its review of the german case could take up to a year .
though it remains unclear what steps the eu commission might take should germany fail to postpone its truck toll , sources in the commission are reported to have said the matter could go as far as the european court of justice .
berlin says it 's playing by the rules berlin , however , is sticking to its stance despite the commission ’ s threats .
german transport minister manfred stolpe has pointed out the implementation of the road toll system – an average of 12.4 cents per kilometer depending on truck size and level of emissions which germany hopes will yield annual revenues of € 2.8 billion – is not in danger .
" the german government is going to do anything it can to convince brussels that the regulation is in line with eu law , " the minister said on thursday in berlin .
stolpe said the planned tax rebates amounting to € 600 million were meant to harmonize practices between truckers who buy fuel in germany , where it is highly taxed to help subsidize the environment and road system , and those who fill-up in lower-tax countries .
he emphasized the rebates would be paid to all transport companies that pay the autobahn toll and buy fuel in germany , regardless of their country of origin .
the eu commission is concerned that non-german trucking companies have had problems obtaining the transponders , which monitor their travel on the autobahns .
however , the german government has said it is paying € 650 million to a private transport consortium to set up and operate satellite-monitored on-board systems in trucks well before the august 31 deadline .
the first of its kind satellite system will use automatic toll-tracking devices built over the roadway at regular intervals to check whether drivers have activated their on-board systems .
trucks without the systems will be able to pay at gas stations .
berlin probe coincides with eu 's own road toll plan the eu commission ’ s probe of the berlin case was launched at the same time brussels unveiled its own proposals for a european system of road-charging for commercial vehicles in an attempt to ease the growing problem of road congestion and open up new sources for funding transport infrastructure .
the commission wants berlin to hold off on the introduction of its road toll system to allow it to examine its pan-eu scheme proposed by de palacio .
the plans , which will allow member states to spend a share of the proceeds from road tolls on rail links for the first time , would apply to some 60,000 kilometers of trans-european roads and are part of a wider drive to boost europe ’ s transport infrastructure .
at present eu countries can only levy charges that reflect the cost of building and maintaining motorways and are not allowed to " cross-subsidize " by charging road users to pay for railways .
" we are not trying to penalize road transport , we are trying to encourage other forms , " de palacio said at a press conference in brussels this week .
" if you start beating the road lobby , you ’ re going to undermine the competitiveness in europe and lose jobs .
we want everything to work , " she emphasized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled times for telekom the european commission started anti-trust proceedings against deutsche telekom on wednesday .

the latest in a string of run-ins involves the german government ’ s plans to impose a new toll on trucks traversing german autobahns , slated to come into operation by august 31 this year .
eu : berlin scheme could violate fair play on wednesday the european commission opened a formal review of the system amid fears the german government ’ s plans to provide € 600 million -lrb- $ 684.3 million -rrb- in tax rebates to the country ’ s truckers who refuel in germany may constitute illegal state aid .
the commission believes the move could favor domestic companies over competitors from other eu countries .
" in principle the german truck toll can not start until we have finished our negotiations , " eu commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , said in brussels .
gilles gantelet , a spokesman for de palacio stressed , " we are of the opinion that germany should attempt to put the system on hold . "
the eu commission has said its review of the german case could take up to a year .
though it remains unclear what steps the eu commission might take should germany fail to postpone its truck toll , sources in the commission are reported to have said the matter could go as far as the european court of justice .
berlin says it 's playing by the rules berlin , however , is sticking to its stance despite the commission ’ s threats .
german transport minister manfred stolpe has pointed out the implementation of the road toll system – an average of 12.4 cents per kilometer depending on truck size and level of emissions which germany hopes will yield annual revenues of € 2.8 billion – is not in danger .
" the german government is going to do anything it can to convince brussels that the regulation is in line with eu law , " the minister said on thursday in berlin .
stolpe said the planned tax rebates amounting to € 600 million were meant to harmonize practices between truckers who buy fuel in germany , where it is highly taxed to help subsidize the environment and road system , and those who fill-up in lower-tax countries .
he emphasized the rebates would be paid to all transport companies that pay the autobahn toll and buy fuel in germany , regardless of their country of origin .
the eu commission is concerned that non-german trucking companies have had problems obtaining the transponders , which monitor their travel on the autobahns .
however , the german government has said it is paying € 650 million to a private transport consortium to set up and operate satellite-monitored on-board systems in trucks well before the august 31 deadline .
the first of its kind satellite system will use automatic toll-tracking devices built over the roadway at regular intervals to check whether drivers have activated their on-board systems .
trucks without the systems will be able to pay at gas stations .
berlin probe coincides with eu 's own road toll plan the eu commission ’ s probe of the berlin case was launched at the same time brussels unveiled its own proposals for a european system of road-charging for commercial vehicles in an attempt to ease the growing problem of road congestion and open up new sources for funding transport infrastructure .
the commission wants berlin to hold off on the introduction of its road toll system to allow it to examine its pan-eu scheme proposed by de palacio .
the plans , which will allow member states to spend a share of the proceeds from road tolls on rail links for the first time , would apply to some 60,000 kilometers of trans-european roads and are part of a wider drive to boost europe ’ s transport infrastructure .
at present eu countries can only levy charges that reflect the cost of building and maintaining motorways and are not allowed to " cross-subsidize " by charging road users to pay for railways .
" we are not trying to penalize road transport , we are trying to encourage other forms , " de palacio said at a press conference in brussels this week .

the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .
the era of chaotic bargain counters and endless lines at the check-out will soon be over . for almost a century , normally under-control germans entered a two-week phase of shopping madness two times a year .
the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .
he relished the two-week limited nature of things .
“ like at the opera , you need an overture and a good ending . ”
germany ’ s main consumer protection organization , however , and many retailers welcome the change , which they consider overdue .
“ customers are responsible and old enough -lsb- to handle the change -rsb- , ” said thomas körner , manager at the karstadt chain of department stores .
one of his colleagues , however , was not so quick to dismiss almost a century of tradition .
“ no matter what happens , ” he said , “ the closeout sales are going to stay in the minds of our customers . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.

it 's also boosted sales .
sale season begins amid economic doldrums germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost .

the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .
the era of chaotic bargain counters and endless lines at the check-out will soon be over . for almost a century , normally under-control germans entered a two-week phase of shopping madness two times a year .
the last monday in july and the last monday in january marked the summer and winter closeout sales , where a variety of goods , notably clothing , sporting equipment and household items , can be had at savings of 50 percent or more .
next week ’ s summer clearance sale , however , could be the last and bring this tradition of semiannual shop-till-you-drop fever to a close .
a new law that is likely to go into effect in january 2004 will allow retailers to have clearance sales whenever they want .
up to now , stores were only allowed the two 14-day clearance sales which were marked by near anarchy as consumers set their alarms early and lined up outside stores in the early morning to be the first in the door to rummage through the piles full of marked-down socks , shirts , skirts and ties .
into the 1970s , the closeout sales played a significant role in german society , according to andreas kaapke of the cologne institute for trade research .
for consumers , the sales were a kind of day trip for the family ; for stores there were a chance to clear their aisles of old merchandise .
price-conscious parents took a day off work and brought their children to the stores twice a year to buy their complete wardrobes for the next six months .
but times changed .
fashion designers no longer brought out collections just in the summer and winter and traveling abroad replaced traveling to the local department store .
“ we want to keep our closeouts ! ”
some groups are opposing the law liberalization , saying it ’ s to the advantage of large retailers and will confuse shoppers .
since 2001 when law restricting rebates and bargaining were loosened , the retail branch has been involved in a sales war to attract german consumers who are increasingly unwilling to spend .
the result has been that customers know with less certainty than they used to if they have actually gotten a bargain or not .
“ price transparency will suffer with the end of the closeout sales , ” said reiner münker , manager at the center for competition in bad homburg .
others seem to regret the end of the sales era on a more emotional level .
“ the closeout sale was like a lighthouse that signaled : now the prices are really going down ! ” said heinz waldmüller , author of several books on bargain hunting .
he relished the two-week limited nature of things .
“ like at the opera , you need an overture and a good ending . ”
germany ’ s main consumer protection organization , however , and many retailers welcome the change , which they consider overdue .
“ customers are responsible and old enough -lsb- to handle the change -rsb- , ” said thomas körner , manager at the karstadt chain of department stores .
one of his colleagues , however , was not so quick to dismiss almost a century of tradition .
“ no matter what happens , ” he said , “ the closeout sales are going to stay in the minds of our customers . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales .
sale season begins amid economic doldrums germany 's twice-yearly close-out sale begins , with thousands of shoppers making tracks to their nearest department stores .
retailers hope sales will give them a needed boost .

the company - owned by american agricultural machinery giant agco - is closing its banner lane plant with the loss of more than a thousand jobs .
the last tractor rolled off the production line in december and the remaining workers will leave the factory on friday .
the plant , which employed more than 5,000 people in the 70s and was the largest tractor factory in the world , closes after more than 60 years of production .
lower costs it was hoped that around a hundred workers would keep their jobs making components but a company feasibility study ruled that out .
agco announced the coventry closure last june and said it would concentrate tractor production on its other sites in france and brazil which benefit from lower production costs .
jim brown , plant director , said : " it 's a sad day .
" it 's a sad day for the workers and it 's a sad day for me personally .
" massey ferguson was the pride and joy of coventry , making tractors famous throughout the world . "
if we had tried to sustain a manufacturing facility here it would not have been efficient .
declan hayden marketing director " it is very disappointing to see the decline of manufacturing in coventry . "
the company will base its european headquarters in coventry but the only tractors left will be those in the company museum .
declan hayden , the company 's marketing director , said the decision was taken to keep the brand competitive in its world markets .
he explained : " if we had tried to sustain a manufacturing facility here it would not have been efficient .
" it would have required significant investment beyond that we now have to make .
" that would have made us less competitive and could have been damaging to even more jobs . "

right to the very end of his mandate , he could and would preach for hours about democracy and development and fighting corruption and poverty - all the buzz words and lofty causes that donors and diplomats love to hear from the mouth of a well-behaved african president .

even many of those close to him told me they had had enough of his showmanship , his manipulative and divisive politicking , and his grand-standing on the international stage as africa 's model democrat .

even his most strident critics agree that mr konare , at the age of 57 , has the intellect , experience and the pan-africanist vision needed to chair the african union .
as chairman of the regional west african body , ecowas , mr konare called for a federal republic of west africa , and he earned worldwide praise for restoring peace to mali after years of ethnic tuareg rebellion .
he is also remembered as the man who brought the continent 's greatest football tournament , the african cup of nations , to mali in 2002 - even if it was on borrowed money .
but some malians are simply relieved that that their former president and his wife , fellow historian adam ba konare , will no longer be hanging about idly in the ex-presidential palace built for them by the chinese in bamako - unemployed and nursing unfulfilled ambitions - or grudges .

what are we about to lose ?
" i was once sent out into no man 's land with another man to a shell crater by the german trench .
they were just yards away - you could hear them talking and stamping their feet to keep warm , " world war i veteran jack davis told bbc news online last year .
" unfortunately , my comrade was shell-shocked .
he was whimpering like a child , " continued mr davis , delivering the words slowly and deliberately , between gasping breaths .
" we could n't stay there with him like that - i saw three germans who might have surrounded us .
that would have meant surrender , or worse , the finish .
i threw my hand grenade and we went back to our trench . "
the old soldier 's son , ken , was taken aback .
" i 've never heard that story before , " he said .
even 84 years after he came home from the trenches , mr davis still had more to say about a conflict which decimated a generation as no other british war ever has .
the death of the former infantryman this week - aged 108 - robs us of any more of his untold stories and yet another human reminder of an event which so many nations vowed never to forget .
with the passing of mr davis , the ranks of the uk 's world war i veterans association has dwindled to just 33 members - though a 104-year-old man has just been sent an application form to join .
" their lives are becoming more and more significant as their numbers diminish , " says dennis goodwin , who runs the association .
for much of their long lives , these survivors of the " war to end all wars " were seldom asked about their experiences .
" when there were many veterans , people in the uk were n't interested in them .
my father fought in the war , as did all my school friends ' dads , but it was never talked about .
even our comic books avoided the war , " says mr goodwin .
longevity has given the remaining veterans ' memories a rarity value , at the very same time as historians , writers and film makers have come to recognise the importance of hearing from ordinary citizens as well as the great and the good whose views once dominated the history books .
this attention has puzzled some veterans .
alec campbell , the final survivor of the disastrous australian landing at gallipoli was elevated to iconic status in his homeland .
" alec has become national property , although i 'm not sure he realises it , " his wife said .
when he died last summer , aged 103 , flags were lowered to half-mast and prime minister john howard cut short a foreign trip to attend the state funeral .
alfred anderson - at 107 the oldest british survivor of the trenches , though not the uk 's oldest veteran - wonders why people should be keen to hear his stories .
" why has all this come up again ?
all these years i 've been trying to forget the war , to put it behind me , " he says .
mr anderson says in recent months his opinions on the morality of war have been sought as his old regiment , the blackwatch , invaded iraq .
" i 'm not angry that the great war did n't turn out to be the war to end all wars .
getting angry does n't do any good .
wars are futile and a loss to both sides .
i was very worried about the blackwatch in iraq and thought some would n't come back . "
though mr anderson points out that modern battles are far different to the trench warfare he endured , the very existence of veterans such as he acts as an important reminder to the nation that wars are best not rushed into casually - as happened in the summer of 1914 .
" i think often of the war , " says mr anderson .
" i think of the loss of all the lads i went to school with . "
if the words of the surviving veterans lend power and poignancy to discussions of the war , what will our understanding of the conflict be when it finally slips from living memory ?
" i do n't think it will stop anyone making a perfectly valid documentary about the war , " says philip nugus , whose tv series world war i in colour is currently showing on five .
" we interviewed several veterans and their personal recollections make the subject more accessible to viewers , but in years to come we 'll still have historians to tell the story with conviction . "
mr nugus says that in recent decades a great deal of veterans ' stories have been recorded for the archives and that these accounts will continue to give us an insight into the war 's savagery .
the veterans association 's dennis goodwin says filmed interviews have their limits .
" the vivid memories are admittedly few and far between , but when i 've watched the veterans on film their stories seem to lack something .
it 's never as good as hearing them in person or listening to a few veterans together , when they really start to spark off each other .
and they 're always ready for a song . "

all these years i 've been trying to forget the war , to put it behind me , " he says .
mr anderson says in recent months his opinions on the morality of war have been sought as his old regiment , the blackwatch , invaded iraq .
alfred anderson -lrb- r -rrb- has been trying to put the war behind him for 80 years " i 'm not angry that the great war did n't turn out to be the war to end all wars .
getting angry does n't do any good .
wars are futile and a loss to both sides .
i was very worried about the blackwatch in iraq and thought some would n't come back . "
though mr anderson points out that modern battles are far different to the trench warfare he endured , the very existence of veterans such as he acts as an important reminder to the nation that wars are best not rushed into casually - as happened in the summer of 1914 .
" i think often of the war , " says mr anderson .
" i think of the loss of all the lads i went to school with . "
if the words of the surviving veterans lend power and poignancy to discussions of the war , what will our understanding of the conflict be when it finally slips from living memory ?
will the war be more distant when all the veterans are gone ?
" i do n't think it will stop anyone making a perfectly valid documentary about the war , " says philip nugus , whose tv series world war i in colour is currently showing on five .
" we interviewed several veterans and their personal recollections make the subject more accessible to viewers , but in years to come we 'll still have historians to tell the story with conviction . "
mr nugus says that in recent decades a great deal of veterans ' stories have been recorded for the archives and that these accounts will continue to give us an insight into the war 's savagery .
the veterans association 's dennis goodwin says filmed interviews have their limits .
" the vivid memories are admittedly few and far between , but when i 've watched the veterans on film their stories seem to lack something .
it 's never as good as hearing them in person or listening to a few veterans together , when they really start to spark off each other .
and they 're always ready for a song . "
