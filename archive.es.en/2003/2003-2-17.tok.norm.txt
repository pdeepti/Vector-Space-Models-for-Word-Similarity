"
taking up on that motto of transparency , the vatican in rome is now openings its archives from 1922 to 1939 so people can at least see what happened in the pre-world war ii period . the archives - as of saturday open to scholars who make a formal request to see them - cover the period when eugenio pacelli , later pope pius xii , was the vatican 's ambassador to berlin . with this " unusual gesture , " the vatican is responding to pressure from critics who have accused the church of not doing enough to stop the persecution of jews and others during the holocaust , said walter brandmüller , chairman of the vatican 's historical commission . attempt to clear its name historian wolfgang schieder , who has for years called for the vatican to open its archives , said that doing so is the only way for the church to clear its name . criticism of the church came as soon after the war as 1963 , with rolf hochhuth 's play " the deputy . "
last year , daniel goldhagen 's book " a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , " urged the church to " tell the truth . " the archives that are now open do not cover the wartime period and the vatican has said that documents from 1931 to 1934 were destroyed by fires and bombing in world war ii . 80,000 meters of papers in citing reasons for delays in opening the archives , the vatican has cited the pure mass of the materials .
the vatican has just 35 employees for 80,000 shelf-meters of archived material .
that 's true , said schieder .
but he pointed out that the vatican itself decides how to staff the archives . vatican documents relating to pope pius xii 's tenure from 1939 to 1958 will not be released until sometime after 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court halts book on catholics and third reich a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany .

dw-world reports from the heart of a demonstration which attracted many more than expected . it 's a leaden-grey and chilly saturday in berlin , and thousands of people are streaming down to alexanderplatz in the city center , wrapped up well against the freezing air .
around 100 000 people are expected at the square for a demonstration calling for " no war on iraq . " indeed , as people gather to start the march , it seems the message has brought out many more than expected . " i want to do something to stop this war , " says 77-year-old herbert lein from the east berlin district of friedrichshain .
it is not his first demonstration : " actually , it 's probably about my fiftieth , " lein says , who was in dresden when it was carpet-bombed on february 14 , 1945 . lein says he will be writing the u.s. president a very long and angry e-mail when he gets home .
" i know that dropping bombs is n't going to solve anything . " anti-war enthusiasts 21 year-old arne and his 27 year-old friend miguel took a special bus from hanover to get to the protest in berlin .
they may be underdressed for saturday 's cold , but are all the more enthusiastic when it comes to their anti-war position and are equally eager to talk .
" it 's no use just sitting around at home , " says arne , clutching a tin of beer tightly to his chest , " people need to get out and show that they 're opposed to war . " shivering in the cold , he asks " why is it that so many european governments support military action when 80 percent of the people are against military action ? " the meaning of peace the demonstration moves off at 12:30 pm .
passing the cathedral , civil-rights activist and theologian friedrich schorlemmer makes a speech on the church 's steps .
welcoming the presence of representatives from so many different religions , he says the word " peace " plays an important role in most religions , and that governments should n't try and justify war by invoking peace . not far from the cathedral , u.s. citizen bridget from munich stands with her german husband and a still unfurled banner .
on it are the words " americans against the war " and then below it in german , " we are the majority . " indeed , it seems there are a lot of americans milling around .
one man has shipped in a consignment of perfectly produced " stop the war " signs from a company in seattle .
and another woman hoists up a stick with a large pretzel pinned to the top , the bready arms of the roll forming a perfect peace sign . joint call for peace a huge array of organizations is represented on this peace march - the german communist party , the green party , the construction workers ' union , various leftwing groups , a host of christian organizations , the turkish communist party , not to mention several rather drunk punks . unter den linden , berlin 's east-west axis , is packed , and the demonstration spills out into the side streets .
forming a carpet of bright color beneath the leaden berlin sky , the crowd is dotted with flags of many nations : palestine , britain , cuba and italy . strolling past the statue of frederick the great , prussia 's soldier king , already splashed with red paint , one demonstrator sits on the figure 's pedestal holding a placard with the message " make art not war . " at the u.s. embassy , a ring of defenses blocks the surrounding roads , while access to the building is only possible through a maze of concrete blocks and fences and a chain of green police vans . despite the police here , their presence is otherwise minimal - limited to the securing of sensitive sites and taking occasional photos from the top of police vans with the cameras of picture hungry demonstrators . more than expected as the crowd arrives at the demonstration 's final destination , the " siegesäule , " or victory column , and the organizers announce that 500,000 people have turned out in berlin on this freezing february day , a great cheer goes up . those who have the stamina to stick around will be treated to east german rock group the puhdys , peacenik songwriter konstantin wecker and a host of other german stars . but will this demonstration actually get what it demands ?

at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .
but with europe split down the middle , that will be a challenge . the european union will hold an emergency summit on monday in a last-ditch effort to find a common position on the growing iraq crisis .
the eu is hoping to avoid further divisive embarrassments like last week 's nato crisis .
the meeting has been called by greek prime minister costas simitis , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency . greece wants to find a unified voice across the 15 member states and heal rifts between european capitals over the possibility of u.s.-led strikes in iraq .
at the same time , greece hopes leaders at the brussels summit will invoke sharp talk to increase pressure on iraqi president saddam hussein to increase cooperation with united nations weapons inspectors .
but with germany and france pitted against britain on the issue of whether to continue inspections or to push for a military solution to the disarmament of iraq , obtaining a common position could prove to be a sisyphusian task .
while european union officials hope monday 's informal meeting of government ministers will help thaw the ice , they remain realistic about the final outcome .
" it wo n't be easy , but we 're hoping to find a solution there , " a greek government spokesman told dw-world .
by calling the meeting , eu officials are hoping to avoid another row like the one seen during this week 's nato controversy .
france , germany and belgium vetoed a request to begin plans for the alliance to provide fellow member turkey with patriot anti-missile rockets , awacs early warning surveillance planes and units to help it defend itself against a biological or chemical weapons attack in the event of a war against neighboring iraq .
growing public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin protest the governments have to find a solution against the backdrop of widespread public opposition to military strikes in iraq .
global demonstrations over the weekend saw more than six million people take to the streets in over 600 cities across the world .
some of the biggest demonstrations were in britain , the u.s. 's outspoken ally in efforts to depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
it is estimated that around two million britons protested across the country .
the largest demonstrations took place in the capital , london , and in the scottish city glasgow , where prime minister tony blair made the case for war to his labour party on saturday .
but many labor party mps remain unconvinced by the government 's arguments .
back bench labor mp clive betts believes blair needs to tone down his pro-war rhetoric and concentrate on greater cooperation with the rest of europe .
" blair is making a mistake in backing bush all the way , " betts told dw-world .
" most of us do n't believe he -lrb- bush -rrb- has the intelligence to see the wider consequences .
i agree with the more cautious position taken by governments like germany and france in europe . "
according to the most-recent polls , around 87 percent of germans oppose a war in iraq .
this view is reflected by the german government 's staunch anti-war position .
in the united kingdom it 's a totally different story .
tony blair 's labor party government is pushing for authorization to strike iraq , if necessary without the backing of the united nations .
but blair is facing increasing criticism at home for his hawkish stance - only 25 percent of brits support going to war with iraq .
if europe is unable to find a common position on iraq , it wo n't be the first time .
during 1991 's gulf war , the eu failed to declare a unified policy on iraq .
months after reunification , the german government provided money , but not troops in the war .
' it 's a complicated situation ' though some members of the european parliament are optimistic a common voice can be found , others are more skeptical .
timothy kirkhope , a british member of parliament who is also a member of the eu 's constitutional convention , says : " we need to find a common stand across europe on iraq , but it 's a very complicated situation with lots of different positions , so i do n't know if we 'll find an answer . "
france , like britain , has the right to use the veto in the security council .
but the french have positioned themselves alongside germany 's anti-war stance .
this has put them in direct opposition to the hawkish position of the british government .
there are real fears that france 's stance , if backed up by other veto wielding states russia and china , will not only split european union down the middle , but also the united nations .
the omens for the meeting have n't boded well from the start .
there were disagreements over the decision to not let european union accession states , mostly from formerly communist eastern europe , attend the conference .
france , germany and belgium were worried that the inclusion of the 13 future eu states - many of which have signed on to the so-called " group of 8 " european countries supporting washington 's hawkish policy - would tip the meeting toward a pro-war outcome .
german press reports stated that german chancellor gerhard schröder held a telephone conversation with british prime minister blair on friday to try and resolve some of the outstanding issues before the meeting .
still , the german government reiterated its stance that it would not participate in any war against iraq on friday at the united nations .

dw-world reports from the heart of a demonstration which attracted many more than expected . it 's a leaden-grey and chilly saturday in berlin , and thousands of people are streaming down to alexanderplatz in the city center , wrapped up well against the freezing air .
around 100 000 people are expected at the square for a demonstration calling for " no war on iraq . " indeed , as people gather to start the march , it seems the message has brought out many more than expected . " i want to do something to stop this war , " says 77-year-old herbert lein from the east berlin district of friedrichshain .
it is not his first demonstration : " actually , it 's probably about my fiftieth , " lein says , who was in dresden when it was carpet-bombed on february 14 , 1945 . lein says he will be writing the u.s. president a very long and angry e-mail when he gets home .
" i know that dropping bombs is n't going to solve anything . " anti-war enthusiasts 21 year-old arne and his 27 year-old friend miguel took a special bus from hanover to get to the protest in berlin .
they may be underdressed for saturday 's cold , but are all the more enthusiastic when it comes to their anti-war position and are equally eager to talk .
" it 's no use just sitting around at home , " says arne , clutching a tin of beer tightly to his chest , " people need to get out and show that they 're opposed to war . " shivering in the cold , he asks " why is it that so many european governments support military action when 80 percent of the people are against military action ? " the meaning of peace the demonstration moves off at 12:30 pm .
passing the cathedral , civil-rights activist and theologian friedrich schorlemmer makes a speech on the church 's steps .
welcoming the presence of representatives from so many different religions , he says the word " peace " plays an important role in most religions , and that governments should n't try and justify war by invoking peace . not far from the cathedral , u.s. citizen bridget from munich stands with her german husband and a still unfurled banner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2003 nato finds solution to end crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato can now plan for deploying awacs aircraft to turkey .
at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .
but the alliance 's secretary general has to take a bureaucratic detour to achieve a compromise . the north atlantic treaty organization , a military alliance that operates on consensus , ended a messy internal conflict late sunday and agreed to begin planning to defend turkey if it is attacked by iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson nato secretary general george robertson expressed relief after sunday 's 13-hour session .
" i am happy to announce that we have been able – collectively – to overcome the impasse we have faced for the past few days , " robertson said .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was triggered by a u.s. request in january that the alliance should begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor in response to a possible american-led invasion of the country led by saddam hussein .
military support detailed among other things , the united states wants the alliance to be prepared to provide airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft that would provide surveillance , patriot missiles that would offer air defense , and special forces that would combat biological and chemical weapons .
three alliance members - germany , france and belgium - resisted the proposal at first and then triggered the conflict last monday by vetoing the u.s. request .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
after the vetoes were filed , robertson launched a six-day campaign of closed negotiations aimed at filling the breach .
robertson did two things to settle the matter .
first , he moved the issue from the alliance 's highest body , the north atlantic council , to the defense planning committee .
this maneuver took one of the critics , france , out of the decision-making process .
the french are a member of the alliance , but have not belonged to the formal military structure since 1966 , when then-french president charles de gaulle withdrew his country to ensure that his troops would never fall under foreign command .
second , he accepted an objection raised by belgium .
the belgians wanted the alliance to acknowledge that it supported the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict peacefully .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt explained his country 's position over the weekend .
" what our country primarily wants to prevent is that this decision would constitute the first step in the buildup to war , " verhofstadt said .
in explaining its change of position , the german government said the nato decision did not represent a political signal to go to war .
the decision " explicitly emphasizes that it involves a purely defensive measure aimed at protecting the alliance and the alliance member turkey in particular , " said bela anda , the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
anda also pointed out that the alliance was supporting the u.n. efforts .
france , however , remained firm in its rejection of the planning .
" turkey is facing absolutely no threat whatsoever , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in a radio interview .
nato solidarity stressed at the end of the talks , robertson announced : " alliance solidarity has prevailed .
nato nations have assumed their collective responsibility towards turkey , a nation at the moment under threat . "
the u.s. ambassador to nato also expressed his relief that the alliance had decided to come to turkey 's defense . " we worked very hard to make sure that our core alliance responsibility of reaching out to an ally in a time of crisis was secured , " r. nicholas burns said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders face difficult decisions on iraq at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .

at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .
but with europe split down the middle , that will be a challenge . the european union will hold an emergency summit on monday in a last-ditch effort to find a common position on the growing iraq crisis .
the eu is hoping to avoid further divisive embarrassments like last week 's nato crisis .
the meeting has been called by greek prime minister costas simitis , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency . greece wants to find a unified voice across the 15 member states and heal rifts between european capitals over the possibility of u.s.-led strikes in iraq .
at the same time , greece hopes leaders at the brussels summit will invoke sharp talk to increase pressure on iraqi president saddam hussein to increase cooperation with united nations weapons inspectors .
but with germany and france pitted against britain on the issue of whether to continue inspections or to push for a military solution to the disarmament of iraq , obtaining a common position could prove to be a sisyphusian task .
while european union officials hope monday 's informal meeting of government ministers will help thaw the ice , they remain realistic about the final outcome .
" it wo n't be easy , but we 're hoping to find a solution there , " a greek government spokesman told dw-world .
by calling the meeting , eu officials are hoping to avoid another row like the one seen during this week 's nato controversy .
france , germany and belgium vetoed a request to begin plans for the alliance to provide fellow member turkey with patriot anti-missile rockets , awacs early warning surveillance planes and units to help it defend itself against a biological or chemical weapons attack in the event of a war against neighboring iraq .
growing public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin protest the governments have to find a solution against the backdrop of widespread public opposition to military strikes in iraq .
global demonstrations over the weekend saw more than six million people take to the streets in over 600 cities across the world .
some of the biggest demonstrations were in britain , the u.s. 's outspoken ally in efforts to depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
it is estimated that around two million britons protested across the country .
the largest demonstrations took place in the capital , london , and in the scottish city glasgow , where prime minister tony blair made the case for war to his labour party on saturday .
but many labor party mps remain unconvinced by the government 's arguments .
back bench labor mp clive betts believes blair needs to tone down his pro-war rhetoric and concentrate on greater cooperation with the rest of europe .
" blair is making a mistake in backing bush all the way , " betts told dw-world .
" most of us do n't believe he -lrb- bush -rrb- has the intelligence to see the wider consequences .
i agree with the more cautious position taken by governments like germany and france in europe . "
according to the most-recent polls , around 87 percent of germans oppose a war in iraq .
this view is reflected by the german government 's staunch anti-war position .
in the united kingdom it 's a totally different story .
tony blair 's labor party government is pushing for authorization to strike iraq , if necessary without the backing of the united nations .
but blair is facing increasing criticism at home for his hawkish stance - only 25 percent of brits support going to war with iraq .
if europe is unable to find a common position on iraq , it wo n't be the first time .
during 1991 's gulf war , the eu failed to declare a unified policy on iraq .
months after reunification , the german government provided money , but not troops in the war .
' it 's a complicated situation ' though some members of the european parliament are optimistic a common voice can be found , others are more skeptical .
timothy kirkhope , a british member of parliament who is also a member of the eu 's constitutional convention , says : " we need to find a common stand across europe on iraq , but it 's a very complicated situation with lots of different positions , so i do n't know if we 'll find an answer . "
france , like britain , has the right to use the veto in the security council .
but the french have positioned themselves alongside germany 's anti-war stance .
this has put them in direct opposition to the hawkish position of the british government .
there are real fears that france 's stance , if backed up by other veto wielding states russia and china , will not only split european union down the middle , but also the united nations .
the omens for the meeting have n't boded well from the start .
there were disagreements over the decision to not let european union accession states , mostly from formerly communist eastern europe , attend the conference .
france , germany and belgium were worried that the inclusion of the 13 future eu states - many of which have signed on to the so-called " group of 8 " european countries supporting washington 's hawkish policy - would tip the meeting toward a pro-war outcome .
german press reports stated that german chancellor gerhard schröder held a telephone conversation with british prime minister blair on friday to try and resolve some of the outstanding issues before the meeting .
still , the german government reiterated its stance that it would not participate in any war against iraq on friday at the united nations .
along with the french government , the germans insisted weapons inspectors needed more time in iraq .
german sources remain optimistic , but in reality , the chances of any significant common ground being reached from monday 's meeting look slim . catherine donegan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .
but the alliance 's secretary general has to take a bureaucratic detour to achieve a compromise . the north atlantic treaty organization , a military alliance that operates on consensus , ended a messy internal conflict late sunday and agreed to begin planning to defend turkey if it is attacked by iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson nato secretary general george robertson expressed relief after sunday 's 13-hour session .
" i am happy to announce that we have been able – collectively – to overcome the impasse we have faced for the past few days , " robertson said .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was triggered by a u.s. request in january that the alliance should begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor in response to a possible american-led invasion of the country led by saddam hussein .
military support detailed among other things , the united states wants the alliance to be prepared to provide airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft that would provide surveillance , patriot missiles that would offer air defense , and special forces that would combat biological and chemical weapons .
three alliance members - germany , france and belgium - resisted the proposal at first and then triggered the conflict last monday by vetoing the u.s. request .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
after the vetoes were filed , robertson launched a six-day campaign of closed negotiations aimed at filling the breach .
robertson did two things to settle the matter .
first , he moved the issue from the alliance 's highest body , the north atlantic council , to the defense planning committee .
this maneuver took one of the critics , france , out of the decision-making process .
the french are a member of the alliance , but have not belonged to the formal military structure since 1966 , when then-french president charles de gaulle withdrew his country to ensure that his troops would never fall under foreign command .
second , he accepted an objection raised by belgium .
the belgians wanted the alliance to acknowledge that it supported the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict peacefully .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt explained his country 's position over the weekend .
" what our country primarily wants to prevent is that this decision would constitute the first step in the buildup to war , " verhofstadt said .
in explaining its change of position , the german government said the nato decision did not represent a political signal to go to war .
the decision " explicitly emphasizes that it involves a purely defensive measure aimed at protecting the alliance and the alliance member turkey in particular , " said bela anda , the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
anda also pointed out that the alliance was supporting the u.n. efforts .
france , however , remained firm in its rejection of the planning .
" turkey is facing absolutely no threat whatsoever , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in a radio interview .
nato solidarity stressed at the end of the talks , robertson announced : " alliance solidarity has prevailed .
nato nations have assumed their collective responsibility towards turkey , a nation at the moment under threat . "
the u.s. ambassador to nato also expressed his relief that the alliance had decided to come to turkey 's defense .

dw-world reports from the heart of a demonstration which attracted many more than expected . it 's a leaden-grey and chilly saturday in berlin , and thousands of people are streaming down to alexanderplatz in the city center , wrapped up well against the freezing air .
around 100 000 people are expected at the square for a demonstration calling for " no war on iraq . " indeed , as people gather to start the march , it seems the message has brought out many more than expected . " i want to do something to stop this war , " says 77-year-old herbert lein from the east berlin district of friedrichshain .
it is not his first demonstration : " actually , it 's probably about my fiftieth , " lein says , who was in dresden when it was carpet-bombed on february 14 , 1945 . lein says he will be writing the u.s. president a very long and angry e-mail when he gets home .
" i know that dropping bombs is n't going to solve anything . " anti-war enthusiasts 21 year-old arne and his 27 year-old friend miguel took a special bus from hanover to get to the protest in berlin .
they may be underdressed for saturday 's cold , but are all the more enthusiastic when it comes to their anti-war position and are equally eager to talk .
" it 's no use just sitting around at home , " says arne , clutching a tin of beer tightly to his chest , " people need to get out and show that they 're opposed to war . " shivering in the cold , he asks " why is it that so many european governments support military action when 80 percent of the people are against military action ? " the meaning of peace the demonstration moves off at 12:30 pm .
passing the cathedral , civil-rights activist and theologian friedrich schorlemmer makes a speech on the church 's steps .
welcoming the presence of representatives from so many different religions , he says the word " peace " plays an important role in most religions , and that governments should n't try and justify war by invoking peace . not far from the cathedral , u.s. citizen bridget from munich stands with her german husband and a still unfurled banner .
on it are the words " americans against the war " and then below it in german , " we are the majority . " indeed , it seems there are a lot of americans milling around .
one man has shipped in a consignment of perfectly produced " stop the war " signs from a company in seattle .
and another woman hoists up a stick with a large pretzel pinned to the top , the bready arms of the roll forming a perfect peace sign . joint call for peace a huge array of organizations is represented on this peace march - the german communist party , the green party , the construction workers ' union , various leftwing groups , a host of christian organizations , the turkish communist party , not to mention several rather drunk punks . unter den linden , berlin 's east-west axis , is packed , and the demonstration spills out into the side streets .
forming a carpet of bright color beneath the leaden berlin sky , the crowd is dotted with flags of many nations : palestine , britain , cuba and italy . strolling past the statue of frederick the great , prussia 's soldier king , already splashed with red paint , one demonstrator sits on the figure 's pedestal holding a placard with the message " make art not war . " at the u.s. embassy , a ring of defenses blocks the surrounding roads , while access to the building is only possible through a maze of concrete blocks and fences and a chain of green police vans . despite the police here , their presence is otherwise minimal - limited to the securing of sensitive sites and taking occasional photos from the top of police vans with the cameras of picture hungry demonstrators . more than expected as the crowd arrives at the demonstration 's final destination , the " siegesäule , " or victory column , and the organizers announce that 500,000 people have turned out in berlin on this freezing february day , a great cheer goes up . those who have the stamina to stick around will be treated to east german rock group the puhdys , peacenik songwriter konstantin wecker and a host of other german stars . but will this demonstration actually get what it demands ?
no , it seems is the consensus among the protestors , but sometimes you just have to make yourself heard . steve laxton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a protest takes shape as berlin prepares to host one of the biggest anti-war rallies in germany of the past two decades , dw-world takes a look behind the scenes of the groups organizing saturday 's protest .

"
taking up on that motto of transparency , the vatican in rome is now openings its archives from 1922 to 1939 so people can at least see what happened in the pre-world war ii period . the archives - as of saturday open to scholars who make a formal request to see them - cover the period when eugenio pacelli , later pope pius xii , was the vatican 's ambassador to berlin . with this " unusual gesture , " the vatican is responding to pressure from critics who have accused the church of not doing enough to stop the persecution of jews and others during the holocaust , said walter brandmüller , chairman of the vatican 's historical commission . attempt to clear its name historian wolfgang schieder , who has for years called for the vatican to open its archives , said that doing so is the only way for the church to clear its name . criticism of the church came as soon after the war as 1963 , with rolf hochhuth 's play " the deputy . "
last year , daniel goldhagen 's book " a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , " urged the church to " tell the truth . " the archives that are now open do not cover the wartime period and the vatican has said that documents from 1931 to 1934 were destroyed by fires and bombing in world war ii . 80,000 meters of papers in citing reasons for delays in opening the archives , the vatican has cited the pure mass of the materials .
the vatican has just 35 employees for 80,000 shelf-meters of archived material .
that 's true , said schieder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2003 eu leaders face difficult decisions on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and gerhard schröder will seek to convince other european leaders their iraq stance is the right one .
at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .
but with europe split down the middle , that will be a challenge . the european union will hold an emergency summit on monday in a last-ditch effort to find a common position on the growing iraq crisis .
the eu is hoping to avoid further divisive embarrassments like last week 's nato crisis .
the meeting has been called by greek prime minister costas simitis , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency . greece wants to find a unified voice across the 15 member states and heal rifts between european capitals over the possibility of u.s.-led strikes in iraq .
at the same time , greece hopes leaders at the brussels summit will invoke sharp talk to increase pressure on iraqi president saddam hussein to increase cooperation with united nations weapons inspectors .
but with germany and france pitted against britain on the issue of whether to continue inspections or to push for a military solution to the disarmament of iraq , obtaining a common position could prove to be a sisyphusian task .
while european union officials hope monday 's informal meeting of government ministers will help thaw the ice , they remain realistic about the final outcome .
" it wo n't be easy , but we 're hoping to find a solution there , " a greek government spokesman told dw-world .
by calling the meeting , eu officials are hoping to avoid another row like the one seen during this week 's nato controversy .
france , germany and belgium vetoed a request to begin plans for the alliance to provide fellow member turkey with patriot anti-missile rockets , awacs early warning surveillance planes and units to help it defend itself against a biological or chemical weapons attack in the event of a war against neighboring iraq .
growing public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin protest the governments have to find a solution against the backdrop of widespread public opposition to military strikes in iraq .
global demonstrations over the weekend saw more than six million people take to the streets in over 600 cities across the world .
some of the biggest demonstrations were in britain , the u.s. 's outspoken ally in efforts to depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
it is estimated that around two million britons protested across the country .
the largest demonstrations took place in the capital , london , and in the scottish city glasgow , where prime minister tony blair made the case for war to his labour party on saturday .
but many labor party mps remain unconvinced by the government 's arguments .
back bench labor mp clive betts believes blair needs to tone down his pro-war rhetoric and concentrate on greater cooperation with the rest of europe .
" blair is making a mistake in backing bush all the way , " betts told dw-world .
" most of us do n't believe he -lrb- bush -rrb- has the intelligence to see the wider consequences .
i agree with the more cautious position taken by governments like germany and france in europe . "
according to the most-recent polls , around 87 percent of germans oppose a war in iraq .
this view is reflected by the german government 's staunch anti-war position .
in the united kingdom it 's a totally different story .
tony blair 's labor party government is pushing for authorization to strike iraq , if necessary without the backing of the united nations .
but blair is facing increasing criticism at home for his hawkish stance - only 25 percent of brits support going to war with iraq .
if europe is unable to find a common position on iraq , it wo n't be the first time .
during 1991 's gulf war , the eu failed to declare a unified policy on iraq .
months after reunification , the german government provided money , but not troops in the war .
' it 's a complicated situation ' though some members of the european parliament are optimistic a common voice can be found , others are more skeptical .
timothy kirkhope , a british member of parliament who is also a member of the eu 's constitutional convention , says : " we need to find a common stand across europe on iraq , but it 's a very complicated situation with lots of different positions , so i do n't know if we 'll find an answer . "
france , like britain , has the right to use the veto in the security council .
but the french have positioned themselves alongside germany 's anti-war stance .
this has put them in direct opposition to the hawkish position of the british government .
there are real fears that france 's stance , if backed up by other veto wielding states russia and china , will not only split european union down the middle , but also the united nations .
the omens for the meeting have n't boded well from the start .
there were disagreements over the decision to not let european union accession states , mostly from formerly communist eastern europe , attend the conference .
france , germany and belgium were worried that the inclusion of the 13 future eu states - many of which have signed on to the so-called " group of 8 " european countries supporting washington 's hawkish policy - would tip the meeting toward a pro-war outcome .
german press reports stated that german chancellor gerhard schröder held a telephone conversation with british prime minister blair on friday to try and resolve some of the outstanding issues before the meeting .
still , the german government reiterated its stance that it would not participate in any war against iraq on friday at the united nations .
along with the french government , the germans insisted weapons inspectors needed more time in iraq .

in a surprise announcement early january , the veteran 83-year-old " dinosaur " of cypriot politics announced his intention to run for a third consecutive term .
clerides , who has steered the republic of cyprus towards entry into the european union during his years as president , is largely seen as the only politician capable of solving the tricky issue of the island ’ s 28-year division .

this is why i feel that my historic responsibility imposes on me the duty to contest the next presidential elections for a limited time . "
clerides has announced that he plans to stay in office for a limited term of 16 months if re-elected .
cyprus is scheduled to join the eu on may 1 , 2004 , and clerides wants to see his work as president fulfilled as well as to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations with turkey over the island ’ s divided status .
to this effect , clerides has urged all political parties on the island to join in a government of national unity .
president 's aide to run against him clerides ’ announcement to run for a third term has come as a surprise because one of his closest aides , attorney general alecos markides , was considered a sure successor to the veteran leader .
markides , who has for years stood by clerides as an advisor in peace talks with turk cypriots , has now announced that he will run against clerides in elections .
markides ’ unexpected candidacy is being supported by several parliamentarians in the governing conservative disy party , which was founded by clerides in the 1970s .
there are now fears that markides ’ candidacy could cause rifts in the party .
experts also fear that markides ’ candidacy could endanger the solution to cyprus ’ long division , which is considered within reach .

" no , to the contrary !

papadopoulos enjoys the support of the entire communist and social democratic opposition .
he has promised that he will negotiate harder than clerides and make sure that the greeks of the island get a better deal in the peace plan .
the international community is worried that papadopoulos ’ tough stance could worsen peace negotiations with the northern turkish part of the island .
political experts fear that he could damage the national topic of reunification with his tactics .
papadopoulos is also internationally unpopular not least because his name is associated with financial investments of the former serbian president slobodan milosevic in cyprus according to the respected paper fileleftheros .
clerides vs. papadopoulos but despite his unsavory reputation , latest opinion polls show that papadopoulos tops popularity ratings .
but it still remains unclear whether he will manage to pass the 50 percent hurdle on sunday because many voters are still undecided .
surveys show that voters ’ trust in clerides and papadopoulos is split on two issues - they would much prefer to leave the solution of the cyprus conflict to clerides , but trust opposition politician papadopoulos more when it comes to domestic issues .
analysts conclude that clerides only has a chance of holding on to power if there is last-minute progress in the cyprus peace negotiations .
the island of cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkey took control of one third of the country in the north , prompted by an athens-supported coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece .

they will have to choose from one of three candidates .
the most high-profile of the three is undoubtedly the incumbent greek cypriot president glafcos clerides .
in a surprise announcement early january , the veteran 83-year-old " dinosaur " of cypriot politics announced his intention to run for a third consecutive term .
clerides , who has steered the republic of cyprus towards entry into the european union during his years as president , is largely seen as the only politician capable of solving the tricky issue of the island ’ s 28-year division .
he has vowed to stick to the deadline of feb .
28 set by u.n. secretary general kofi annan for greek and turkish cypriots to agree to his proposal for the island ’ s reunification .
more time to carry out " historic responsibility " " developments are rapid and historic .
they will determine the future of cyprus and in the next few months we will be called upon to reach major decisions , " clerides told a news conference in nicosia in january , shortly after his announcement .
" we must seek a viable settlement of the cyprus problem with determination and good sense . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus president glafcos clerides saying his term ’ s end on feb .
28 left too little time to solve the cyprus problem , clerides said : " in order to negotiate a just and viable settlement , i need sufficient time and a clear mandate from the people ...
this is why i feel that my historic responsibility imposes on me the duty to contest the next presidential elections for a limited time . "
clerides has announced that he plans to stay in office for a limited term of 16 months if re-elected .
cyprus is scheduled to join the eu on may 1 , 2004 , and clerides wants to see his work as president fulfilled as well as to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations with turkey over the island ’ s divided status .
to this effect , clerides has urged all political parties on the island to join in a government of national unity .
president 's aide to run against him clerides ’ announcement to run for a third term has come as a surprise because one of his closest aides , attorney general alecos markides , was considered a sure successor to the veteran leader .
markides , who has for years stood by clerides as an advisor in peace talks with turk cypriots , has now announced that he will run against clerides in elections .
markides ’ unexpected candidacy is being supported by several parliamentarians in the governing conservative disy party , which was founded by clerides in the 1970s .
there are now fears that markides ’ candidacy could cause rifts in the party .
experts also fear that markides ’ candidacy could endanger the solution to cyprus ’ long division , which is considered within reach .
but markides is adamant that it won ’ t .
" no , to the contrary !
i ’ m going to play my political role , just as i have been doing so far , express my opinion and support our party – at the negotiating table as well as in the committees that are involved with technical problems of the cyprus conflict , " he told dw-radio .
hardliner could endanger reunification process clerides faces the stiffest competition from the third candidate , 69-year-old hardliner tassos papadopoulos , leader of the center-right democratic party -lrb- diko -rrb- .
papadopoulos enjoys the support of the entire communist and social democratic opposition .
he has promised that he will negotiate harder than clerides and make sure that the greeks of the island get a better deal in the peace plan .
the international community is worried that papadopoulos ’ tough stance could worsen peace negotiations with the northern turkish part of the island .
political experts fear that he could damage the national topic of reunification with his tactics .
papadopoulos is also internationally unpopular not least because his name is associated with financial investments of the former serbian president slobodan milosevic in cyprus according to the respected paper fileleftheros .
clerides vs. papadopoulos but despite his unsavory reputation , latest opinion polls show that papadopoulos tops popularity ratings .
but it still remains unclear whether he will manage to pass the 50 percent hurdle on sunday because many voters are still undecided .
surveys show that voters ’ trust in clerides and papadopoulos is split on two issues - they would much prefer to leave the solution of the cyprus conflict to clerides , but trust opposition politician papadopoulos more when it comes to domestic issues .
analysts conclude that clerides only has a chance of holding on to power if there is last-minute progress in the cyprus peace negotiations .
the island of cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkey took control of one third of the country in the north , prompted by an athens-supported coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece .
settlement within reach ?

at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .
but the alliance 's secretary general has to take a bureaucratic detour to achieve a compromise . the north atlantic treaty organization , a military alliance that operates on consensus , ended a messy internal conflict late sunday and agreed to begin planning to defend turkey if it is attacked by iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george robertson nato secretary general george robertson expressed relief after sunday 's 13-hour session .
" i am happy to announce that we have been able – collectively – to overcome the impasse we have faced for the past few days , " robertson said .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was triggered by a u.s. request in january that the alliance should begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor in response to a possible american-led invasion of the country led by saddam hussein .
military support detailed among other things , the united states wants the alliance to be prepared to provide airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft that would provide surveillance , patriot missiles that would offer air defense , and special forces that would combat biological and chemical weapons .
three alliance members - germany , france and belgium - resisted the proposal at first and then triggered the conflict last monday by vetoing the u.s. request .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
after the vetoes were filed , robertson launched a six-day campaign of closed negotiations aimed at filling the breach .
robertson did two things to settle the matter .
first , he moved the issue from the alliance 's highest body , the north atlantic council , to the defense planning committee .
this maneuver took one of the critics , france , out of the decision-making process .
the french are a member of the alliance , but have not belonged to the formal military structure since 1966 , when then-french president charles de gaulle withdrew his country to ensure that his troops would never fall under foreign command .
second , he accepted an objection raised by belgium .
the belgians wanted the alliance to acknowledge that it supported the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict peacefully .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt explained his country 's position over the weekend .
" what our country primarily wants to prevent is that this decision would constitute the first step in the buildup to war , " verhofstadt said .
in explaining its change of position , the german government said the nato decision did not represent a political signal to go to war .
the decision " explicitly emphasizes that it involves a purely defensive measure aimed at protecting the alliance and the alliance member turkey in particular , " said bela anda , the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
anda also pointed out that the alliance was supporting the u.n. efforts .
france , however , remained firm in its rejection of the planning .
" turkey is facing absolutely no threat whatsoever , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in a radio interview .
nato solidarity stressed at the end of the talks , robertson announced : " alliance solidarity has prevailed .
nato nations have assumed their collective responsibility towards turkey , a nation at the moment under threat . "
the u.s. ambassador to nato also expressed his relief that the alliance had decided to come to turkey 's defense . " we worked very hard to make sure that our core alliance responsibility of reaching out to an ally in a time of crisis was secured , " r. nicholas burns said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders face difficult decisions on iraq at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .

at an emergency summit on monday , european leaders will try to hash out a united front on the touchy issue of iraq .
but with europe split down the middle , that will be a challenge . the european union will hold an emergency summit on monday in a last-ditch effort to find a common position on the growing iraq crisis .
the eu is hoping to avoid further divisive embarrassments like last week 's nato crisis .
the meeting has been called by greek prime minister costas simitis , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency . greece wants to find a unified voice across the 15 member states and heal rifts between european capitals over the possibility of u.s.-led strikes in iraq .
at the same time , greece hopes leaders at the brussels summit will invoke sharp talk to increase pressure on iraqi president saddam hussein to increase cooperation with united nations weapons inspectors .
but with germany and france pitted against britain on the issue of whether to continue inspections or to push for a military solution to the disarmament of iraq , obtaining a common position could prove to be a sisyphusian task .
while european union officials hope monday 's informal meeting of government ministers will help thaw the ice , they remain realistic about the final outcome .
" it wo n't be easy , but we 're hoping to find a solution there , " a greek government spokesman told dw-world .
by calling the meeting , eu officials are hoping to avoid another row like the one seen during this week 's nato controversy .
france , germany and belgium vetoed a request to begin plans for the alliance to provide fellow member turkey with patriot anti-missile rockets , awacs early warning surveillance planes and units to help it defend itself against a biological or chemical weapons attack in the event of a war against neighboring iraq .
growing public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlin protest the governments have to find a solution against the backdrop of widespread public opposition to military strikes in iraq .
global demonstrations over the weekend saw more than six million people take to the streets in over 600 cities across the world .
some of the biggest demonstrations were in britain , the u.s. 's outspoken ally in efforts to depose iraqi leader saddam hussein .
it is estimated that around two million britons protested across the country .
the largest demonstrations took place in the capital , london , and in the scottish city glasgow , where prime minister tony blair made the case for war to his labour party on saturday .
but many labor party mps remain unconvinced by the government 's arguments .
back bench labor mp clive betts believes blair needs to tone down his pro-war rhetoric and concentrate on greater cooperation with the rest of europe .
" blair is making a mistake in backing bush all the way , " betts told dw-world .
" most of us do n't believe he -lrb- bush -rrb- has the intelligence to see the wider consequences .
i agree with the more cautious position taken by governments like germany and france in europe . "
according to the most-recent polls , around 87 percent of germans oppose a war in iraq .
this view is reflected by the german government 's staunch anti-war position .
in the united kingdom it 's a totally different story .
tony blair 's labor party government is pushing for authorization to strike iraq , if necessary without the backing of the united nations .
but blair is facing increasing criticism at home for his hawkish stance - only 25 percent of brits support going to war with iraq .
if europe is unable to find a common position on iraq , it wo n't be the first time .
during 1991 's gulf war , the eu failed to declare a unified policy on iraq .
months after reunification , the german government provided money , but not troops in the war .
' it 's a complicated situation ' though some members of the european parliament are optimistic a common voice can be found , others are more skeptical .
timothy kirkhope , a british member of parliament who is also a member of the eu 's constitutional convention , says : " we need to find a common stand across europe on iraq , but it 's a very complicated situation with lots of different positions , so i do n't know if we 'll find an answer . "
france , like britain , has the right to use the veto in the security council .
but the french have positioned themselves alongside germany 's anti-war stance .
this has put them in direct opposition to the hawkish position of the british government .
there are real fears that france 's stance , if backed up by other veto wielding states russia and china , will not only split european union down the middle , but also the united nations .
the omens for the meeting have n't boded well from the start .
there were disagreements over the decision to not let european union accession states , mostly from formerly communist eastern europe , attend the conference .
france , germany and belgium were worried that the inclusion of the 13 future eu states - many of which have signed on to the so-called " group of 8 " european countries supporting washington 's hawkish policy - would tip the meeting toward a pro-war outcome .
german press reports stated that german chancellor gerhard schröder held a telephone conversation with british prime minister blair on friday to try and resolve some of the outstanding issues before the meeting .
still , the german government reiterated its stance that it would not participate in any war against iraq on friday at the united nations .
along with the french government , the germans insisted weapons inspectors needed more time in iraq .
german sources remain optimistic , but in reality , the chances of any significant common ground being reached from monday 's meeting look slim . catherine donegan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the end of a 13-hour meeting , nato leaders agree to plan to defend turkey from a possible attack by iraq .
but the alliance 's secretary general has to take a bureaucratic detour to achieve a compromise . the north atlantic treaty organization , a military alliance that operates on consensus , ended a messy internal conflict late sunday and agreed to begin planning to defend turkey if it is attacked by iraq .

" i am happy to announce that we have been able – collectively – to overcome the impasse we have faced for the past few days , " robertson said .
the dispute , described as one of the worst in nato 's 53-year history , was triggered by a u.s. request in january that the alliance should begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor in response to a possible american-led invasion of the country led by saddam hussein .
military support detailed among other things , the united states wants the alliance to be prepared to provide airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft that would provide surveillance , patriot missiles that would offer air defense , and special forces that would combat biological and chemical weapons .
three alliance members - germany , france and belgium - resisted the proposal at first and then triggered the conflict last monday by vetoing the u.s. request .
all three maintained that such preparations would indicate that a war against iraq was inevitable .
after the vetoes were filed , robertson launched a six-day campaign of closed negotiations aimed at filling the breach .
robertson did two things to settle the matter .
first , he moved the issue from the alliance 's highest body , the north atlantic council , to the defense planning committee .
this maneuver took one of the critics , france , out of the decision-making process .
the french are a member of the alliance , but have not belonged to the formal military structure since 1966 , when then-french president charles de gaulle withdrew his country to ensure that his troops would never fall under foreign command .
second , he accepted an objection raised by belgium .
the belgians wanted the alliance to acknowledge that it supported the united nations ' effort to settle the conflict peacefully .
belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt explained his country 's position over the weekend .
" what our country primarily wants to prevent is that this decision would constitute the first step in the buildup to war , " verhofstadt said .
in explaining its change of position , the german government said the nato decision did not represent a political signal to go to war .
the decision " explicitly emphasizes that it involves a purely defensive measure aimed at protecting the alliance and the alliance member turkey in particular , " said bela anda , the spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
anda also pointed out that the alliance was supporting the u.n. efforts .
france , however , remained firm in its rejection of the planning .
" turkey is facing absolutely no threat whatsoever , " french foreign minister dominique de villepin said in a radio interview .
nato solidarity stressed at the end of the talks , robertson announced : " alliance solidarity has prevailed .
nato nations have assumed their collective responsibility towards turkey , a nation at the moment under threat . "
the u.s. ambassador to nato also expressed his relief that the alliance had decided to come to turkey 's defense .

"
taking up on that motto of transparency , the vatican in rome is now openings its archives from 1922 to 1939 so people can at least see what happened in the pre-world war ii period . the archives - as of saturday open to scholars who make a formal request to see them - cover the period when eugenio pacelli , later pope pius xii , was the vatican 's ambassador to berlin . with this " unusual gesture , " the vatican is responding to pressure from critics who have accused the church of not doing enough to stop the persecution of jews and others during the holocaust , said walter brandmüller , chairman of the vatican 's historical commission . attempt to clear its name historian wolfgang schieder , who has for years called for the vatican to open its archives , said that doing so is the only way for the church to clear its name . criticism of the church came as soon after the war as 1963 , with rolf hochhuth 's play " the deputy . "
last year , daniel goldhagen 's book " a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , " urged the church to " tell the truth . " the archives that are now open do not cover the wartime period and the vatican has said that documents from 1931 to 1934 were destroyed by fires and bombing in world war ii . 80,000 meters of papers in citing reasons for delays in opening the archives , the vatican has cited the pure mass of the materials .
the vatican has just 35 employees for 80,000 shelf-meters of archived material .
that 's true , said schieder .
but he pointed out that the vatican itself decides how to staff the archives . vatican documents relating to pope pius xii 's tenure from 1939 to 1958 will not be released until sometime after 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court halts book on catholics and third reich a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany .

"
taking up on that motto of transparency , the vatican in rome is now openings its archives from 1922 to 1939 so people can at least see what happened in the pre-world war ii period . the archives - as of saturday open to scholars who make a formal request to see them - cover the period when eugenio pacelli , later pope pius xii , was the vatican 's ambassador to berlin . with this " unusual gesture , " the vatican is responding to pressure from critics who have accused the church of not doing enough to stop the persecution of jews and others during the holocaust , said walter brandmüller , chairman of the vatican 's historical commission . attempt to clear its name historian wolfgang schieder , who has for years called for the vatican to open its archives , said that doing so is the only way for the church to clear its name . criticism of the church came as soon after the war as 1963 , with rolf hochhuth 's play " the deputy . "
last year , daniel goldhagen 's book " a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , " urged the church to " tell the truth . " the archives that are now open do not cover the wartime period and the vatican has said that documents from 1931 to 1934 were destroyed by fires and bombing in world war ii . 80,000 meters of papers in citing reasons for delays in opening the archives , the vatican has cited the pure mass of the materials .
the vatican has just 35 employees for 80,000 shelf-meters of archived material .
that 's true , said schieder .
but he pointed out that the vatican itself decides how to staff the archives . vatican documents relating to pope pius xii 's tenure from 1939 to 1958 will not be released until sometime after 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court halts book on catholics and third reich a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany .

they will have to choose from one of three candidates .
the most high-profile of the three is undoubtedly the incumbent greek cypriot president glafcos clerides .
in a surprise announcement early january , the veteran 83-year-old " dinosaur " of cypriot politics announced his intention to run for a third consecutive term .
clerides , who has steered the republic of cyprus towards entry into the european union during his years as president , is largely seen as the only politician capable of solving the tricky issue of the island ’ s 28-year division .
he has vowed to stick to the deadline of feb .
28 set by u.n. secretary general kofi annan for greek and turkish cypriots to agree to his proposal for the island ’ s reunification .
more time to carry out " historic responsibility " " developments are rapid and historic .
they will determine the future of cyprus and in the next few months we will be called upon to reach major decisions , " clerides told a news conference in nicosia in january , shortly after his announcement .
" we must seek a viable settlement of the cyprus problem with determination and good sense . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus president glafcos clerides saying his term ’ s end on feb .
28 left too little time to solve the cyprus problem , clerides said : " in order to negotiate a just and viable settlement , i need sufficient time and a clear mandate from the people ...
this is why i feel that my historic responsibility imposes on me the duty to contest the next presidential elections for a limited time . "
clerides has announced that he plans to stay in office for a limited term of 16 months if re-elected .
cyprus is scheduled to join the eu on may 1 , 2004 , and clerides wants to see his work as president fulfilled as well as to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations with turkey over the island ’ s divided status .
to this effect , clerides has urged all political parties on the island to join in a government of national unity .
president 's aide to run against him clerides ’ announcement to run for a third term has come as a surprise because one of his closest aides , attorney general alecos markides , was considered a sure successor to the veteran leader .
markides , who has for years stood by clerides as an advisor in peace talks with turk cypriots , has now announced that he will run against clerides in elections .
markides ’ unexpected candidacy is being supported by several parliamentarians in the governing conservative disy party , which was founded by clerides in the 1970s .
there are now fears that markides ’ candidacy could cause rifts in the party .
experts also fear that markides ’ candidacy could endanger the solution to cyprus ’ long division , which is considered within reach .
but markides is adamant that it won ’ t .
" no , to the contrary !
i ’ m going to play my political role , just as i have been doing so far , express my opinion and support our party – at the negotiating table as well as in the committees that are involved with technical problems of the cyprus conflict , " he told dw-radio .
hardliner could endanger reunification process clerides faces the stiffest competition from the third candidate , 69-year-old hardliner tassos papadopoulos , leader of the center-right democratic party -lrb- diko -rrb- .
papadopoulos enjoys the support of the entire communist and social democratic opposition .
he has promised that he will negotiate harder than clerides and make sure that the greeks of the island get a better deal in the peace plan .
the international community is worried that papadopoulos ’ tough stance could worsen peace negotiations with the northern turkish part of the island .
political experts fear that he could damage the national topic of reunification with his tactics .
papadopoulos is also internationally unpopular not least because his name is associated with financial investments of the former serbian president slobodan milosevic in cyprus according to the respected paper fileleftheros .
clerides vs. papadopoulos but despite his unsavory reputation , latest opinion polls show that papadopoulos tops popularity ratings .
but it still remains unclear whether he will manage to pass the 50 percent hurdle on sunday because many voters are still undecided .
surveys show that voters ’ trust in clerides and papadopoulos is split on two issues - they would much prefer to leave the solution of the cyprus conflict to clerides , but trust opposition politician papadopoulos more when it comes to domestic issues .
analysts conclude that clerides only has a chance of holding on to power if there is last-minute progress in the cyprus peace negotiations .
the island of cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkey took control of one third of the country in the north , prompted by an athens-supported coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece .

they will have to choose from one of three candidates .
the most high-profile of the three is undoubtedly the incumbent greek cypriot president glafcos clerides .
in a surprise announcement early january , the veteran 83-year-old " dinosaur " of cypriot politics announced his intention to run for a third consecutive term .
clerides , who has steered the republic of cyprus towards entry into the european union during his years as president , is largely seen as the only politician capable of solving the tricky issue of the island ’ s 28-year division .
he has vowed to stick to the deadline of feb .
28 set by u.n. secretary general kofi annan for greek and turkish cypriots to agree to his proposal for the island ’ s reunification .
more time to carry out " historic responsibility " " developments are rapid and historic .
they will determine the future of cyprus and in the next few months we will be called upon to reach major decisions , " clerides told a news conference in nicosia in january , shortly after his announcement .
" we must seek a viable settlement of the cyprus problem with determination and good sense . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus president glafcos clerides saying his term ’ s end on feb .
28 left too little time to solve the cyprus problem , clerides said : " in order to negotiate a just and viable settlement , i need sufficient time and a clear mandate from the people ...
this is why i feel that my historic responsibility imposes on me the duty to contest the next presidential elections for a limited time . "
clerides has announced that he plans to stay in office for a limited term of 16 months if re-elected .
cyprus is scheduled to join the eu on may 1 , 2004 , and clerides wants to see his work as president fulfilled as well as to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations with turkey over the island ’ s divided status .
to this effect , clerides has urged all political parties on the island to join in a government of national unity .
president 's aide to run against him clerides ’ announcement to run for a third term has come as a surprise because one of his closest aides , attorney general alecos markides , was considered a sure successor to the veteran leader .
markides , who has for years stood by clerides as an advisor in peace talks with turk cypriots , has now announced that he will run against clerides in elections .
markides ’ unexpected candidacy is being supported by several parliamentarians in the governing conservative disy party , which was founded by clerides in the 1970s .
there are now fears that markides ’ candidacy could cause rifts in the party .
experts also fear that markides ’ candidacy could endanger the solution to cyprus ’ long division , which is considered within reach .
but markides is adamant that it won ’ t .
" no , to the contrary !
i ’ m going to play my political role , just as i have been doing so far , express my opinion and support our party – at the negotiating table as well as in the committees that are involved with technical problems of the cyprus conflict , " he told dw-radio .
hardliner could endanger reunification process clerides faces the stiffest competition from the third candidate , 69-year-old hardliner tassos papadopoulos , leader of the center-right democratic party -lrb- diko -rrb- .
papadopoulos enjoys the support of the entire communist and social democratic opposition .
he has promised that he will negotiate harder than clerides and make sure that the greeks of the island get a better deal in the peace plan .
the international community is worried that papadopoulos ’ tough stance could worsen peace negotiations with the northern turkish part of the island .
political experts fear that he could damage the national topic of reunification with his tactics .
papadopoulos is also internationally unpopular not least because his name is associated with financial investments of the former serbian president slobodan milosevic in cyprus according to the respected paper fileleftheros .
clerides vs. papadopoulos but despite his unsavory reputation , latest opinion polls show that papadopoulos tops popularity ratings .
but it still remains unclear whether he will manage to pass the 50 percent hurdle on sunday because many voters are still undecided .
surveys show that voters ’ trust in clerides and papadopoulos is split on two issues - they would much prefer to leave the solution of the cyprus conflict to clerides , but trust opposition politician papadopoulos more when it comes to domestic issues .
analysts conclude that clerides only has a chance of holding on to power if there is last-minute progress in the cyprus peace negotiations .
the island of cyprus has been divided since 1974 when turkey took control of one third of the country in the north , prompted by an athens-supported coup in nicosia aimed at uniting the island with greece .
settlement within reach ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan , center , smiles while turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash , right , shakes hands with greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides annan ’ s comprehensive peace plan hammered out last november has raised hopes that the greeks and turks will reach broad agreement on reunification by feb .
28 .
both sides have raised objections to certain aspects of the plan and turk cypriot leader rauf denktash in particular has caused concern with his strong resistance to bits of the plan .
however , in a sign that denktash might be more amenable to the plan , turkish leader erdogan has stepped up pressure on denktash to work toward a solution .
" there is a problem to be solved in cyprus , " erdogan said last month .
" we should sit at the table , put our position forward and solve it . "
erdogan , who is keen to resolve the conflict in order to promote turkey 's bid to join the eu , added " this issue has remained a problem over the last 40 years ... and it will grow to become a bigger problem with each coming generation .
we want the negotiations to continue and we want this issue to be concluded .

newspapers across the continent debate whether the protests will succeed in averting an attack on iraq .
several papers analyse the prospects for monday 's european union summit , called to discuss the crisis caused by divisions over iraq .
people power " the world demo " reads the headline on the paris daily liberation , which shows protesters in london 's trafalgar square holding a banner reading simply : " no ! "
governments will find it harder than before to ignore the public tageszeitung the paper hails saturday 's worldwide anti-war demonstrations as an " unprecedented mobilization " .
germany 's tageszeitung is equally upbeat as it notes a change in public mood following the protests .
" suddenly millions of people in europe and the world can nurture the hope that they themselves can do something - by taking to the streets , " it says .
it is not the task of democratic governments to place themselves above the wishes of their citizens el mundo the paper thinks that after this weekend " governments will find it harder than before to ignore the public " .
this view is echoed in the russian government mouthpiece rossiyskaya gazeta .
it says that the world does n't want a war and the " unprecedented scale " of the protests proves this .
" politicians will be obliged to consider public opinion because when millions take to the streets it 's a serious matter . "
lessons learned the madrid daily el mundo feels that the demonstrations are a lesson to governments which support the us stance - such as that of spanish prime minister jose maria aznar .
" the prime minister must learn some kind of lesson from the massive rejection of his policy , " the paper argues .
" it is not the task of democratic governments to place themselves above the wishes of their citizens , as if the latter were unable to hold opinions , " it adds .
the russian liberal daily vremya novostey believes that britain 's tony blair has indeed taken heed .
" the demonstrations were so striking that mr blair in essence for the first time admitted the possibility of disarming iraq by peaceful means , " it says .
reluctant hero the front-page of the paris daily , le figaro , shows a photo of new yorkers standing behind an anti-war banner on which the words " merci la france " are visible .
some people are prisoners of war - as for chirac , he is a prisoner of peace liberation but liberation suggests that president jacques chirac may become uncomfortable with his new role as " global hero of peace " .
" he has always maintained simultaneously that he is opposed to the american juggernaut and that he is ready to jump on the bandwagon at the last minute , " it observes .
but his opposition to war has been so successful that mr chirac will require " enormous agility " to perform the latter feat , it says .
" some people are prisoners of war .
as for chirac , he is a prisoner of peace . "
eu united the british prime minister and german chancellor schroeder also come in for some criticism .
for the first time the lack of definition of a common foreign and security policy has put the eu members up against a crisis of extreme gravity abc the two leaders are guilty of " one shameful thing , " says the berliner zeitung .
that is they set out their iraqi policy unilaterally rather than coordinating with the rest of the european union .
it calls for today 's emergency eu summit to oppose this unilateralism .
" this is demanded not only by millions of demonstrators but also by the eu treaty and un charter . "
the spanish daily abc also welcomes greek eu presidency 's decision to call the summit .
" for the first time the lack of definition of a common foreign and security policy has put the eu members up against a crisis of extreme gravity , " it observes .
but the paper is disappointed that the 10 central european countries due to join the eu were not invited to the meeting .
the majority of these states are aligned with washington 's policy .
" one gets the feeling that the greek presidency is acting in favour of one of the two stances over which the fifteen already seem divided , " it comments .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

oldham borough council said the increase is likely to be agreed because it is facing budget cuts of £ 2m .
the authority said the increase in payments is largely out of their control , because funding is increasing for the likes of emergency services .
if the increase is agreed it will mean residents of average band d properties will pay £ 133 more during the next financial year .
council leaders said there were also due to be increases in funding for waste disposal and transport , which again are outside their control .
they also said the council has lost more than £ 4.5m in central government funding , which has been a big factor in the budget cuts .

consumer spending will find it difficult to grow much faster than 1 % for the next couple of years " centre for economics and business research report high street spending has been fuelled by uk consumers borrowing against the growing value of their homes .
however , the cebr says there are signs the rate of borrowing may fall over the next two years .
as a result , high street spending and the wider economy could also suffer a downturn .
consumer spending has been the main force behind the uk economy 's relative strength over the past few years , offsetting the troubled manufacturing sector .
high street spending rapid growth in house prices and falling interest rates has tempted many homeowners to borrow against the increased value of their homes .
according to a new report from datamonitor , lending secured against a property amounted to £ 14.4bn -lrb- $ 23bn -rrb- in 2002 up from £ 10.5bn the year before .
and the money borrowed has increasingly been spent on the high street .
the cebr report says that in 2000 , 2.2 % of the money spent by consumers was from lending secured against a property .
this figure had increased to 6.5 % by 2002 .
had it not been for this extra money , annual consumer spending growth would have slowed from 4.6 % to 0.8 % last year .
the group are predicting that the importance of borrowing will fall to 5.6 % this year and 4 % in 2004 .
as a result , " consumer spending will find it difficult to grow much faster than 1 % for the next couple of years , " the cebr concludes .

mr papadopoulos , who defeated veteran incumbent glafcos clerides by a large margin , has said he wants to change part of the un plan , days before a 28 february deadline for both sides to accept it .
the centrist democratic party leader told a cheering crowd after his election that he wanted to " bring about the improvements necessary to change the -lsb- un -rsb- plan into a viable and lasting solution " .
mr papadopoulos is seeking the right of return of all greek cypriot refugees to the turkish cypriot northern sector , while the proposals allow for only about 50 % .
the political dilemma comes a week before un secretary general kofi annan is due to visit cyprus to try to secure support for the pact he devised .
surprise win election results showed mr papadopoulos won 51.5 % of the votes , to 38.8 % for mr clerides .
attorney general alecos markides won a further 6.6 % , with the remaining votes split among another seven candidates .
the 83-year-old mr clerides acknowledged defeat in a telephone call to mr papadopoulos and wished him luck .
although mr papadopoulos had been ahead in opinion polls , it had been widely expected that he would fail to get more than 50 % support in the first round .
mr papadopoulos will take over negotiations on reunifying cyprus , with less than two weeks to thrash out a deal before the deadline .
when the un proposals to reunite the island were first made public last november , mr papadopoulos argued they should be rejected without a second glance .
but since then , he has been keen to stress that he accepts the plan as the basis of a future settlement .
lack of trust mr papadopoulos - who will become the fifth greek cypriot president - benefited from the support of the influential communist party , akel , one of the largest political groups in cyprus .
he also picked up votes from greek cypriots who believe that mr clerides has given away too much in un-sponsored talks with the turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash .
a recent poll found that 64 % of greek cypriots doubted that their political leaders could find a political solution to the island 's troubles in the near future .
in january thrice-weekly talks began between mr denktash and mr clerides aimed at resolving their differences over the current un plan .
mr denktash has threatened to stand down as leader rather than sign the plan in its present form .
cyprus has been partitioned along ethnic lines since turkey invaded in 1974 in response to an abortive greek cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with greece .

he died on february 14 , 269 a.d. , the same day that had been devoted to love lotteries , and he left a farewell note for the jailer 's daughter signed " from your valentine " .
whatever its origins , valentine 's day has become a vast industry , with an overwhelming number of cards , presents and even holidays being sold the world over to celebrate it .
who is your valentine this year ?
have you sent or received any cards or gifts ?

on valentines day 1987 , it was bitterly cold and was snowing and i had what turned out to be the flu , but it was the happiest day of my life , why because i married the loveliest man in the world and i am happier than i ever thought possible .
audrey owen , england on valentine 's day 1997 i was lucky enough to have a valentine for the first time - my boyfriend of just three months spoilt me rotten - roses , presents , champagne and dinner in an amazing french restaurant .
six years later we 're still together and are looking forward to our 7th valentine 's day together - it will be even more special than the first .
katy , uk after 11 years of marriage , my husband and i rarely bother with valentines day , but this year agreed to get each other cards .
this morning , i handed him his card with a kiss , and what did he do ?
told me could n't be bothered to get one !
did n't even pretend he 'd forgotten .
oh well , guess i 'll just not be bothered to cook his dinner tonight , then .
lesley , england on february 14th of last year i did not expect to receive a card and as it happened i did not , whilst all around me beautiful flowers were being delivered left right and centre , i sat at my desk quietly and prayed !
by september this year i had given up hope of meeting someone yet by mid october i had met my gorgeous man , richard , he treats me like a princess and we are off to new york on saturday ! this year i feel like the luckiest girl on earth !
claire , england do something unique and personal , not what the ad men say you should be doing john b , uk i hope all of you out there who are in a relationship of whatever sort that you are secure in your love for each other that you do n't need overpriced pieces of cardboard to prove it .
i would rather make life special for my wife rather than focussing a lot of energy and even more money on giving retails yet another opportunity to overcharge me for worthless garbage .
do something unique and personal , not what the ad men say you should be doing .
john b , uk i married my husband on valentine 's day in 1998 , so it 's our 5th wedding anniversary this year .
all our female friends thought it was romantic , all our male friends commented " good call , only one day a year to have to remember ! "
heidi , uk i always hated valentine 's day until i met my husband who has never forgotten a birthday , anniversary or indeed valentine 's day .
we always exchange cards , single red roses and gifts .
who says middle age has to be sad ?
jane f , uk i was buying my girlfriend a present and card in a big card shop today and i saw a girl burst into tears .
she was only about 17 if that and was with her friend .
apparently she 'd just split from her boyfriend .
it reminded me that not everyone has " someone " and that we should spare a thought for those that are hurting while seemingly the rest of the world are celebrating .
mark , wales it 's commercial exploitation that shows how the mythology of romance contradicts the reality of coupling and perpetuates a definition of love that creates dangerous expectations .
emily , uk my wife got her sister to send me a valentine 's card so i would not recognise the writing - then she would not speak to me all day for getting a card from another woman !
jez , uk my ideal valentines night would be sitting in a restaurant overlooking the sea with my husband and a glass of red wine .
well ...
i can always wish ca n't i !
it will be more like me and my husband watching tv with a curry ! !
ahhh lurve x debbie , west mids , uk i had a similar experience , valentine 's cards arriving from mr.x with no way of knowing who mr.x was .
it was such a thrill , especially as they arrived at my boarding school where mail was closely monitored so naturally it was mortifying not to have any on february 14th .
years later i found out it was my great aunt .
bless her !
she made me feel special and fuelled my teenage dreams of romance !
tessa , uk to all those lonely hearts out there , do n't despair even couples can feel left out , especially if one half of the partnership is not romantic enough to join in the fun of valentine 's day the other half of the relationship , uk on the 14 feb 1992 at midday i married the most beautiful woman in the world .
11 years and 3 kids later she 's even more beautiful .
lee furness , uk the last time i had one of these so called profiteers ' dreams , sorry valentine 's cards , i was 5 .
i 'm now 25 and it has n't made me cold , bitter or cynical .
martin , uk i ran like the wind all the way down to his house in the darkness to put his card through the door anna , uk i started seeing someone shortly before valentine 's day 4 years ago and was disappointed that no card had arrived on the day and was having second thoughts about sending my own .
however , in the evening just to make sure , i looked underneath the doormat ... and there it was .
i ran like the wind all the way down to his house in the darkness to put his card through the door .
now we 've got a lovely two year old and are talking about getting married ...
anna , uk i usually find that i have a severe outbreak of crabbiness on valentines day .
these is probably due to the fact that i have been single on most and feel quite ill at the sight of courting couples and endless marketing campaigns all around me .
this year i have a boyfriend and am still finding it hard to control my spininess ... however i have managed to bite the bullet and send him a red rose - he had better appreciate it !
andrew , uk it is an interesting day i have never been sent a card or gift and i my self have never sent a card or gift to anybody , but i am amazed by what people and specially young people do on this day zarghuna , afghanistan every valentines day , i receive the best present from my partner , alex .
i think that he is the most romantic man on earth as he serenades me with a string quartet , red roses , champagne and strawberries .
i just want to thank him so much for making the day so special and that i love him very much .
will you marry me ?
becky , uk i want to know what becky 's boyfriends answer was !
tc , uk my boyfriend , colin , wrote a song for me called ' fiona , my hearts desire ' and had it recorded in a studio .
it was the most romantic thing that anyone has ever done for me .
fiona , scotland i marvelled at how special it would be for someone to use that sign to propose brian , ireland when i was 11 , i was on my first trip abroad from ireland .
it was a school trip and at one stage we were in piccadilly circus at night time .
i got separated from the group , and decided to stay put and stand in a doorway until they came back for me .
that was straight across from the coca-cola sign and i marvelled at how special it would be for someone to use that sign to propose .
18 years later on valentine 's day 1993 , that 's exactly what happened .
" jeanie will you marry me " .
-lrb- by the way , the answer was " yes " , and we 're happily married now with two kids ! -rrb-
brian , ireland quiet nights in , a meal , the log fire , the sofa . ah , perhaps someday i 'll have company .
andrew , uk well , my only offer so far is from a drunken regular at my local .
i 'm thinking of taking him up on it , as i have seen no evidence of any other offers .
oh well , i 'll stay at home and play with my cat - she loves me .
love ?
bah !
liz , uk from 1991 to 1998 i received a valentine card from ' my loving mr x ' .
to this day i do not know who sent them .
during that time i moved house , moved jobs , changed hair colour and mr x was there every step of the way .
they have now stopped but it 's infuriating to know that i will probably never find out who sent them .
