according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .
this weekend , whatever was left crumbled in a velvet revolution that mirrored similar peaceful government overthrows in yugoslavia and the former czechoslovakia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .
it supported the separatists in georgia , so that during shevardnadze 's presidency the country never saw peace . that too led to the georgian head of state 's downfall . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief of dw-radio foreign languages send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.11.2003 possible compromise in eu deficits row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for german finance minister hans eichel to end the budget row with brussels .
eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .
given that scenario , senior eu diplomats say compromise is the least damaging option now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister expects support german newspaper editorials on wednesday looked at germany 's woes with the eu growth and stability pact , as well as u.s. president bush 's visit to london .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .
given that scenario , senior eu diplomats say compromise is the least damaging option now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister expects support german newspaper editorials on wednesday looked at germany 's woes with the eu growth and stability pact , as well as u.s. president bush 's visit to london .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .
if i was forced tomorrow to use my authority it would lead to a lot of bloodshed .
i have never betrayed my country and so it is better that the president resigns , " he said in televised remarks .
jubilation in tbilisi tens of thousands of georgians greeted the news with joy , waving the flag of the opposition , singing songs , honking their car horns and dancing late into the night .
the scenes were reminiscent of those 14 years ago , when the soviet union collapsed and the cold war ended , a revolution that , ironically , shevardnadze helped bring about .
the speed of this latest revolution has left georgians wondering what is coming next .
many see saakashvili , the 35-year-old leader of the opposition national movement and a pro-western reformer , as the best candidate for president .
he led the political fight against shevardnadze , and praised his decision to step down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader mikhail saakashvili " the president has accomplished a courageous act , " said saakashvili .
" by his resignation , he avoided spilling blood in the country ...

" the united states and the international community stand ready to support the new government in holding free and fair parliamentary elections in the future , " said u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher , adding that secretary of state colin powell had called burdzhanadze to offer support .
the european commission said it is confident that the handover of power in georgia will remain non-violent , and that it is essential the country conduct democratic elections in line with international standards .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .
if i was forced tomorrow to use my authority it would lead to a lot of bloodshed .
i have never betrayed my country and so it is better that the president resigns , " he said in televised remarks .
jubilation in tbilisi tens of thousands of georgians greeted the news with joy , waving the flag of the opposition , singing songs , honking their car horns and dancing late into the night .
the scenes were reminiscent of those 14 years ago , when the soviet union collapsed and the cold war ended , a revolution that , ironically , shevardnadze helped bring about .
the speed of this latest revolution has left georgians wondering what is coming next .
many see saakashvili , the 35-year-old leader of the opposition national movement and a pro-western reformer , as the best candidate for president .
he led the political fight against shevardnadze , and praised his decision to step down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader mikhail saakashvili " the president has accomplished a courageous act , " said saakashvili .
" by his resignation , he avoided spilling blood in the country ...
history will judge him kindly . "
support from abroad both the united states and the european union say they are ready to work with georgia 's new interim government to help the country maintain stability and democracy .
" the united states and the international community stand ready to support the new government in holding free and fair parliamentary elections in the future , " said u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher , adding that secretary of state colin powell had called burdzhanadze to offer support .
the european commission said it is confident that the handover of power in georgia will remain non-violent , and that it is essential the country conduct democratic elections in line with international standards .
the whereabouts of ousted leader shevardnadze are still unclear , but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman has said shevardnadze would be welcome in germany should he want to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 new basque plan angers spanish government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dark times are coming , the struggle continues : " grafitti bearing the symbol of the basque separatist group eta .
a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "

" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .
it supported the separatists in georgia , so that during shevardnadze 's presidency the country never saw peace . that too led to the georgian head of state 's downfall . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief of dw-radio foreign languages send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .

brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .
given that scenario , senior eu diplomats say compromise is the least damaging option now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister expects support german newspaper editorials on wednesday looked at germany 's woes with the eu growth and stability pact , as well as u.s. president bush 's visit to london .

finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .
it supported the separatists in georgia , so that during shevardnadze 's presidency the country never saw peace . that too led to the georgian head of state 's downfall . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief of dw-radio foreign languages send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .

the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .

at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .

a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .

" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .
this weekend , whatever was left crumbled in a velvet revolution that mirrored similar peaceful government overthrows in yugoslavia and the former czechoslovakia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .
his comments were aimed at stressing the reformed nature of the party , which claims to have abandoned past defiance under tudjman , who backed bosnian croat separatists and had a poor human rights record . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .

in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 german press review : the decline of a respected statesman after the weekend unrest in georgia , where thousands of people stormed the parliament building protesting rigged elections , germany ’ s editorialists offered their thoughts on the ousted leader eduard shevardnadze . " in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .

it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .
it supported the separatists in georgia , so that during shevardnadze 's presidency the country never saw peace . that too led to the georgian head of state 's downfall . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief of dw-radio foreign languages send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .

ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .

the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 german press review : the decline of a respected statesman after the weekend unrest in georgia , where thousands of people stormed the parliament building protesting rigged elections , germany ’ s editorialists offered their thoughts on the ousted leader eduard shevardnadze . " in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .
a power vacuum in georgia can only be avoided if democracy is practiced legitimately and the country is stabilized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .
if i was forced tomorrow to use my authority it would lead to a lot of bloodshed .
i have never betrayed my country and so it is better that the president resigns , " he said in televised remarks .
jubilation in tbilisi tens of thousands of georgians greeted the news with joy , waving the flag of the opposition , singing songs , honking their car horns and dancing late into the night .
the scenes were reminiscent of those 14 years ago , when the soviet union collapsed and the cold war ended , a revolution that , ironically , shevardnadze helped bring about .
the speed of this latest revolution has left georgians wondering what is coming next .
many see saakashvili , the 35-year-old leader of the opposition national movement and a pro-western reformer , as the best candidate for president .
he led the political fight against shevardnadze , and praised his decision to step down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader mikhail saakashvili " the president has accomplished a courageous act , " said saakashvili .
" by his resignation , he avoided spilling blood in the country ...

support from abroad both the united states and the european union say they are ready to work with georgia 's new interim government to help the country maintain stability and democracy .
" the united states and the international community stand ready to support the new government in holding free and fair parliamentary elections in the future , " said u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher , adding that secretary of state colin powell had called burdzhanadze to offer support .
the european commission said it is confident that the handover of power in georgia will remain non-violent , and that it is essential the country conduct democratic elections in line with international standards .
the whereabouts of ousted leader shevardnadze are still unclear , but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's spokesman has said shevardnadze would be welcome in germany should he want to come .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .

and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his government fallen , eduard shevardnadze will have plenty of time to contemplate his 55-year career .
fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 opinion : shevardnadze did right in the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators had been protesting alleged election fraud in georgian parliamentary elections for weeks .
georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .

" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .
this weekend , whatever was left crumbled in a velvet revolution that mirrored similar peaceful government overthrows in yugoslavia and the former czechoslovakia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de georgia 's velvet revolution : new leader urges calm georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 opinion : shevardnadze did right in the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators had been protesting alleged election fraud in georgian parliamentary elections for weeks .
georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .

georgian president shevardnadze finally did the right thing by resigning on sunday .
but will the now jubilant opposition act constructively for the benefit of the country or be fragmented by power struggles ? outgoing georgian president eduard shevardnadze 's fate has been decided .
he has - albeit reluctantly - resigned .
in georgia an era has come to an end .
shevardnadze misjudged the political situation for weeks .
the people wanted a new political beginning without him and his clan , who had lined their pockets so uninhibitedly in past years .
the president underestimated his political opponents .
they succeeded in mobilizing the masses and , with flags waving , the people stormed the parliament on saturday and ousted the aging president together with his bodyguards .
tv cameras broadcast the images throughout the world . seventy-five-year-old shevardnadze could have spared himself the humiliation .
not just the georgians , also many people in the west , would have wished him a dignified departure .
after all , it was shevardnadze who had saved his country from an even longer civil war in 1992 .
in the west many remember shevardnadze 's role in the reunification of germany and the end of the cold war . making history shevardnadze made political history at one time .
it hurt to see how he clung to power , how he helplessly appealed to the security forces to end the " opposition 's coup d 'état , " as he called it . at the same time , the army and the police behaved very responsibly .
they did n't take action against the demonstrators .
a large number of the generals refused to serve shevardnadze .
for that reason too , he had no other choice in the end but to resign .
the " velvet revolution " in tbilisi proceeded practically free of violence . once before , 13 years ago , during the final phases of the ussr , hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of the capital .
they demanded democracy and georgian independence .
soviet security forces brutally used spades and gas against the demonstrators .
many died .
the memory of it continues to haunt georgians like a trauma .
that was one of the reasons why the soldiers practiced restraint in past weeks , and the protests went on peacefully . what next ?
what will come next in georgia ?
the newly elected parliament has n't yet been constituted .
nino burdzhanadze , who was the speaker of the outgoing parliament , is now the acting head of state .
burdzhanadze is an experienced , responsible politician .
she 's no firebrand like the 35-year-old opposition leader mikhail saakashvili , who tries to win people over with populist slogans . with his resignation shevardnadze did his country a final service and made possible a reasonably orderly change of power .
new elections will take place soon . the opposition has been in agreement so far because they have pursued a common aim : shevardnadze 's resignation .
now there is fear that a power struggle could lead to discord .
the danger of a civil war in georgia has not yet been averted . strategic interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the governments in moscow and washington will continue to watch developments in the caucasus closely .
both countries have strategic interests in the borderland between the orient and the occident .
the focus is caspian oil , or to be more precise , the pipelines that bring the " black gold " to the west .
the russians are keen on the routes crossing their territory .
the americans want to prevent exactly that and are thus building a pipeline that goes via azerbaijan and georgia to turkey . shevardnadze had taken the americans ' side in this repeat of the " great game " -lrb- which was played by russia and britain a century ago to gain the dominating influence over the middle east -rrb- .
moscow did n't forgive him for it .
it supported the separatists in georgia , so that during shevardnadze 's presidency the country never saw peace . that too led to the georgian head of state 's downfall . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief of dw-radio foreign languages send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .
with neither side showing any willingness to budge , the debate over the future of mondragón , or arrasate as the basques call it , is likely to simmer for years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain bans basque nationalist party spain slapped a three-year ban on the basque nationalist party batasuna on monday .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .

he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .

" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .
with neither side showing any willingness to budge , the debate over the future of mondragón , or arrasate as the basques call it , is likely to simmer for years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain bans basque nationalist party spain slapped a three-year ban on the basque nationalist party batasuna on monday .
it 's the first of a two-prong attack on the party that the spanish government accuses of supporting the armed separatist group eta .

" in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .

" in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .
a power vacuum in georgia can only be avoided if democracy is practiced legitimately and the country is stabilized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the speed of this latest revolution has left georgians wondering what is coming next .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .
if i was forced tomorrow to use my authority it would lead to a lot of bloodshed .
i have never betrayed my country and so it is better that the president resigns , " he said in televised remarks .
jubilation in tbilisi tens of thousands of georgians greeted the news with joy , waving the flag of the opposition , singing songs , honking their car horns and dancing late into the night .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .

“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .

eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .
given that scenario , senior eu diplomats say compromise is the least damaging option now . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister expects support german newspaper editorials on wednesday looked at germany 's woes with the eu growth and stability pact , as well as u.s. president bush 's visit to london .

finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth .

fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 the “ caucasus fox ” takes a bow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with his government fallen , eduard shevardnadze will have plenty of time to contemplate his 55-year career .
fitting the classic description of a survivor , georgian president eduard shevardnadze endured political crises , putsches and even assassination attempts during his 55-year career .
but this weekend , he ran out of luck . if you take a close look at eduard shevardnadze 's family tree , it comes as little surprise that he would rise within the ranks of the georgian communist party .
he was born in 1928 in a western georgian village and raised by a father who was a russian language and literature teacher with membership in the senior ranks of the communist party .
his brother would later become an influential functionary within the party .
but shevardnadze 's political climb quickly eclipsed the political successes of his family .
he would go on to lead georgia ’ s communist party for 15 years between 1972-1985 , holding tight reign of the soviet state and suppressing nationalist flare-ups .
prior to leading georgia , he worked his way up through the party , eventually serving for four years as georgia ’ s interior minister .
in that role , he earned a strong reputation as a man who fought against corruption in the communist party apparatus .
shevardnadze demonstrated his political skills and growing party clout by demanding concessions from moscow for georgian nationalists .
in 1978 , he succeeded in persuading moscow to anchor georgian as the region ’ s official language in the constitution .
a father of german reunification later , during the perestroika era , shevardnadze served as foreign minister and political confidant to then russian president mikhail gorbachev and emerged as a leading champion of disarmament during the twilight of the cold war .
among his successes was the negotiation of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty between moscow and washington .
shevardnadze also served as one of the chief russian architects of german reunification - a fact not lost on german political leaders , who quickly offered shevardnadze exile over the weekend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners celebrate on top of wall as east germans cross through dismantled berlin wall , germany .
" should shevardnadze decide he wants to come to germany , " government spokesman bela anda said , " he would , not least because of his service of german reunification , be welcome . "
during his five-year term as foreign minister , schevardnadze drew the scorn of dogmatic communist party members for policies they perceived as too friendly toward the west .
he resigned in 1990 , warning that a dictatorship was imminent in russia .
indeed , hardliners attempted a coup the following summer .
struggling to avoid civil war in georgia though the 1991 coup failed , it did succeed in leading to the toppling of the soviet union .
at the time , shevardnadze placed his political support with gorbachev ’ s opponent , boris yeltsin , and returned to georgia , which by then had become destabilized by political unrest .
there , he took up the post of chairman of the security council in 1992 , at a time when two renegade georgian regions , abkhazia and south ossetia , wanted to break away from tibilisi .
more than 10,000 died in the violent two-year conflict that followed .
shevardnadze managed to prevent the country from falling into a full-fledged civil war , but other troubles brewed .
during his two terms as president , he failed to pull georgia out of its deep economic crisis and corruption and poverty remain serious problems .
he made overtures to nato for georgian membership and he succeeded in getting a seat for georgia in the council of europe .
but these moves also drew criticism at home from detractors who said shevardnaze was merely maneuvering to buttress his own power .
they viewed with much skepticism his dramatic transformation from apparatchik to a westernized democrat .
though he has remained popular abroad , support for shevardnadze in georgia had been sliding for years .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .

ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .

the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 german press review : the decline of a respected statesman after the weekend unrest in georgia , where thousands of people stormed the parliament building protesting rigged elections , germany ’ s editorialists offered their thoughts on the ousted leader eduard shevardnadze . " in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .
a power vacuum in georgia can only be avoided if democracy is practiced legitimately and the country is stabilized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .

the speed of this latest revolution has left georgians wondering what is coming next .

he led the political fight against shevardnadze , and praised his decision to step down .

" the united states and the international community stand ready to support the new government in holding free and fair parliamentary elections in the future , " said u.s. state department spokesman richard boucher , adding that secretary of state colin powell had called burdzhanadze to offer support .
the european commission said it is confident that the handover of power in georgia will remain non-violent , and that it is essential the country conduct democratic elections in line with international standards .

georgia 's new interim leader nino burdzhanadze has promised fresh elections following the resignation of president eduard shevardnadze , who was forced out of office after three weeks of protests . in accordance with georgia 's constitution , presidental duties passed to outgoing parliament speaker nino burdzhanadze , who hailed the non-violent transition of power and praised the police and army for standing on the side of the people .
" we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgia 's recent history without shedding a single drop of blood , " burdzhanadze said .
in her first televised address late on sunday , she urged people to remain calm and return to work .
elections are expected to be held within 45 days .
mass protests parliamentary elections on november 2 were widely thought to have been rigged .
they triggered three weeks of protests in the georgian capital , tbilisi .
discontent with the leadership of president eduard shevardnadze , 75 , had been mounting in the former soviet state for more than a decade , with many people blaming him for their country 's impoverished , corrupt state .
the political crisis came to a head on saturday when opposition supporters led by mikhail saakashvili stormed the parliament building .
shevardnadze 's first response was to declare a state of emergency and refuse to hand over power .
on sunday , following talks with russian foreign minister igor ivanov , shevardnadze agreed to resign after 11 years in power .
" i see that all this simply can not go on .
if i was forced tomorrow to use my authority it would lead to a lot of bloodshed .
i have never betrayed my country and so it is better that the president resigns , " he said in televised remarks .
jubilation in tbilisi tens of thousands of georgians greeted the news with joy , waving the flag of the opposition , singing songs , honking their car horns and dancing late into the night .
the scenes were reminiscent of those 14 years ago , when the soviet union collapsed and the cold war ended , a revolution that , ironically , shevardnadze helped bring about .

" in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .
a power vacuum in georgia can only be avoided if democracy is practiced legitimately and the country is stabilized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.11.2003 possible compromise in eu deficits row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is running out for german finance minister hans eichel to end the budget row with brussels .
eu finance ministers begin meeting in brussels on monday to defuse a row over excessive budget deficits in germany and france .
at stake is the eu 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the value of the euro . in the run-up to monday 's meeting in brussels with the eu finance ministers , italy has been hinting at a compromise proposal it would put forward to relax the tension that 's been building over repeated breaches of eu budget rules by berlin and paris .
details of the compromise have n't been released , but italy , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it would shift the emphasis from the " fixed parameters " of the stability pact , which demands that budget deficits of eu member states not exceed three percent of gross domestic product .
germany and france are set to breach that limit for the third successive year in 2004 .
brussels vs. berlin the row has become particularly pronounced between brussels and berlin .
the european commission has demanded that germany cut next year 's structural defict by more than originally planned in the country 's budget proposals , meaning up to € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- in additional savings measures .
german finance minister hans eichel has rejected these demands , arguing that the government is already implementing massive reforms and that the extra cuts would hinder germany 's fledgling economic recovery .
in a preview of the upcoming brussels debate , eichel faced a special question and answer session in the german parliament .
the opposition conservative and neo-liberal parties , who have taken the side of the european commission and say germany should commit to the extra € 6 billion in deficit cuts , have insisted that the stability pact takes priority over a planned government tax reform .
creating a crisis former german finance minister theo waigel , who played a central role in creating the pact , said germany was causing an eu crisis .
" this unbelievable fiscal and monetary policy course makes me absolutely livid , " he told the german nürnberger nachrichten newspaper .
european central bank chief jean-claude trichet urged all eu governments to abide by budget rules .
" this , something like the stability and growth pact has very , very strong economic underpinnings in a single -lrb- currency -rrb- zone , which is not a federal entity , " trichet told cnbc television .
" i very profoundly wish and hope that all partners concerned will be up to their responsibilities . "
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm has taken an even harder line on germany 's deficit than the european commission .
" the demands of the commission do n't go far enough , " zalm said .
as for a possible italian-brokered compromise , zalm said that such action would damage the stability and growth pact .
" if it 's found , the pact wo n't be dead , only hurt , " he told die welt newspaper .
banks urge flexibility german banking experts , on the other hand , are demanding flexibility .
the chief economist of the hypovereinsbank , martin hüfner , showed understanding for eichel 's predicament .
" as long as the economic recovery remains so weak , there 's absolutely no sense in cutting back the deficit , " he told the berliner zeitung .
" in such a situation , you just have to tolerate the deficit . "
germany has been fighting hard to avoid budget disciplinary procedure , which can ultimately lead to massive fines .
if the european commission were to recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers would have to give their approval .
the commission has told ministers to stand up to france and germany and avoid a political compromise .
but according to sweden 's minister for international economic affairs , gunnar lund , germany has enough votes to get its way .
" germany and france have succeeded in creating a blocking minority to prevent a decision from being adopted , " lund said , adding that italy and britain would back berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.11.2003 german press review : the decline of a respected statesman after the weekend unrest in georgia , where thousands of people stormed the parliament building protesting rigged elections , germany ’ s editorialists offered their thoughts on the ousted leader eduard shevardnadze . " in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .
a power vacuum in georgia can only be avoided if democracy is practiced legitimately and the country is stabilized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" in the eyes of the world , and in particular us germans , the white haired man in georgia is remembered fondly as the soviet union 's foreign minister who helped end the cold war and push for german reunification , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
the years since then have been less pleasant , the paper noted in reference to president shevardnadze ’ s largely unsuccessful struggle against corruption and mismanagement .
geographically located between turkey and russia , georgia serves as a transit country for caspian oil and plays an important role for russia and the united states .
but , as the paper put it , " the old tactician has ended up in a dead end by trying to please both sides . "
" between the man who opened the door to change in eastern europe and the reform blocker is a world of difference , " commented the leipziger volkszeitung , adding that shevardnadze ignored the angry masses , who eventually toppled him from power .
the paper noted that schevardnadze 's policies revolved around clinging onto power at all costs , and " this led him to filling the pockets of his political allies with international aid money , supporting political intrigues and kicking out opponents . "
the election fraud was only the tip of the iceberg commented the daily .
according to the kölner stadt anzeiger , the end of schevardnadze 's reign was long foreseeable .
from the very beginning of his regime in 1992 , it was obvious that he was unable to guide the country that fought long and hard for its independence along a straight path .
but because the united states is concerned about georgia 's security as a transit county for oil from the caspian sea , washington and moscow will help ensure the peaceful retreat of the 75-year-old leader , the paper wrote .
bonn 's general anzeiger looked back on georgia ’ s brief history since independence .
as one of the wealthiest former soviet republics , it quickly sank into the depths of regional conflicts , corruption , criminality , election fraud , internal power struggles and external interests .
and as the misery in the country increased , president schevardnadze became even more entangled in the corruption .
however , the paper reflected , it is only now that the alarm bells are ringing in washington and moscow as the united states and russia worry about the stormy decline in stability in a region that has gained in strategic value due to the campaign against terror and as a transport route for caspian oil .
the decision to hold early elections seems to be a way both powers can avert the destabilization of the region , the paper concluded .
berlin 's tagesspiegel worried that after schvardnazde ’ s resignation , the danger of a power vacuum ensuing in georgia becomes very real .
although there is a clear alternative in the face of the new acting head of state , nino burjanadze , the paper warned that the opposition must prove to the world that they have the will and capability to secure their legitimate demand for a change in leadership with legal means .

a controversial proposal that would establish a basque nation is the latest hindrance to peace in the region .
madrid says it will battle the plan in spain ’ s highest court . the basque name for mondragón , a small town in the heart of the basque country , is arrasate .
the sign beside the road leading into the town is covered in graffiti .
it is a stronghold of radical basque separatists .
until it was banned last year , their party , batasuna , held power in the town .
ignacio lakunza is the new mayor of mondragón .
he ’ s a basque nationalist but not a separatist , a fact that worried him after his election .
" i think the decisive factor that helped keep the peace here in arrasate was the plan proposed by ibarretxe , " he said .
these days , the town is split over a proposal by the basque regional premier and leader of the basque nationalist party , juan jose ibarretxe , to enter the basque region 's 2.1 million inhabitants into " free association " with spain - a move that would require madrid to accept the notion of a basque nation .
this would mean spaniards would become " foreigners " in the basque region - a move many people here in mondragón would welcome .
the plan would also give the mostly autonomous region more control over taxes , education and justice and permit basque leaders to establish ties with the neighboring navarre and basque regions of france .
a persistent threat a number of terrorists from eta were born and raised here .
though many are now imprisoned , their photos still hang in the city center - a sight that is uncomfortable for many opposition politicians , who live in constant fear of being attacked .
in fact , some have even had molotov cocktails thrown at their homes or cars .
the eta terrorist organization has been responsible for the killings of at least 850 people since 1968 in its fight for independence .
ibarretxe has found few friends in the opposition with his plan - and many have outright shunned it , especially in a region where 60 percent of the population are not even basques .
" it divides society into so-called ‘ nationalists ’ and ‘ non-nationalists ’ , " warned francisco garcia raya , a member of the opposition basque socialist party .
" each group is roughly the same size .
this will only lead to a head on confrontation .
it will polarize opinion and harden positions on both sides , which is not a good thing . "
few know the dangers of polarization in the basque region better than gorka landabura , the editor in chief of the weekly magazine aldaketa .
he has been the victim of the never-ending terror campaign against him .
eighteen months ago his right hand was seriously damaged when he opened a letter bomb .
he says the ibarretxe plan wo n't solve anything .
" anyone can put forward a proposal , there 's no harm in that , but this plan is premature , " landabura said .
" first we have to clean the house from the inside before we can decide which color to paint it on the outside . "
a citizens ' initiative terrorists attacks blamed on eta remain the biggest problem .
a new civic initiative called basta ya -lrb- translated roughly as " enough is enough " -rrb- says it has had enough of this violence .
many of its members have lost relatives in terrorist attacks and some are afraid to leave their homes without a bodyguard .
basta ya 's main aim is to inform people .
" what is the aim of a basque state ?
to continue the hatred of spain ?
xenophobia dressed in ideology !
basta ya and other groups have proven that ideological persecution exists , " said organizer carlos martinez goriran .
" you pay a high price - a very high price if you 're not a so-called ‘ nationalist . ’ "
opinions about the plan among locals is divided .
" i 'm sorry , but it 's totally ridiculous , " said one resident .
" we 're already more prosperous than other spanish regions . "
another responded : " ibarretxe just wants to discuss the political prerequisites with spain , that 's all . "
the basque regional economy is one of the strongest in spain , though it 's focus is predominantly domestic .
but there are problems underlying the solid economic output .
recent figures indicate that foreign companies prefer investing in other parts of spain .
the basque trade association has spoken out against the ibarretxe plan , saying it could pose a threat to the region ’ s economic future .
" it could mean an escalation of the row between the spanish government in madrid and the basque government in vitoria , " cautioned enrique portocarrero of the basque industry association .
" that would lead to political instability and result in economic problems - and that 's never a good thing . "
a legal challenge meanwhile , madrid would like to stop the train before it gets out of the station .
earlier this month , it filed suit with the constitutional court , spain 's highest tribunal , to stop the latest push for basque independence .
the government of prime minister jose maria aznar described the plan as a " totalitarian " violation of spain ’ s constitution .
the basque parliament , however , has said it will likely vote on ibarretxe 's plan in september .
but any voter referendum would be delayed until at least 2005 .
" the initiative by mr. ibarretxe implies a totalitarian plan in the way it is being carried out , in its content and by the people who are promoting it , " justice minister jose maria michavila said .
" it is a confusing maneuver that says it wants to reform the statute but in reality seeks to reform - mutilate - the constitution , " michavila said .

according to results , the conservative opposition party has claimed 76 of the parliament ’ s 140 permanent seats , while prime minister ivica racan and his ruling social democrat coalition secured just 66 . with a mere 60 percent of the 4.3 million people eligible to vote actually casting a ballot , voter turnout was at its lowest in a decade .
the low turnout was seen as a bonus for the right wing , which has a stronger tradition of motivated and disciplined voting . speaking after the preliminary results were announced on sunday evening , sanader was in no doubt about his victory .
“ we are the only clear winners , ” he said .
the 50-year-old academic , who claims to have reformed the once ultra-nationalist party founded by the late president franjo tudjman , said he considered the results a clear mandate from the croatian people for the strongest party to finally get croatia moving . sanader is planning to hold initial talks on the creation of a new government on monday .
the new coalition could include the peasant party -lrb- hss -rrb- , which is the only conservative party in the incumbent center-left coalition .
ahead of the elections party chief zlatko tomcic indicated that he might join a coalition with either the left or right , but on sunday evening , he stated that he had not yet decided which side he would support . humble defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica racan following the announcement of preliminary results , prime minister ivica racan -lrb- photo -rrb- appeared on croatian television , saying that he was prepared to accept defeat .
“ if these results are final , this really means we do not have enough votes to form a government coalition .
in that case i will be able to congratulate those who won and wish croatian citizens a lot of luck and success , ” he said . racan , who led the social democrats to victory over the hdz in 2000 on the promise of western prosperity and respectability , came under sharp criticism from the right wing democratic union for pushing through market reforms at the expense of social welfare .
although a run of reforms strengthened the market economy , the average monthly income in croatia is just € 525 -lrb- $ 618 -rrb- , and unemployment soars at 15 percent . stating the aims both major parties topped their election campaigns with the issue of croatia joining the european union in 2007 .
and speaking on sunday night , sanader set out his goals for the future : “ croatia will be very clear and determined .
we want to join nato in 2006 and the european union in 2007 , which is ambitious but feasible . ” analysts are already predicting difficulties for the balkan nation in its quest to become an eu member .
they suggest that such a clear turn to the right could mean an uphill struggle on the path to securing accession to the union . croatian analyst davor gjenero told the reuters news agency on sunday that a fresh wave of nationalism was on the rise and spreading through former yugoslavia .
although there is no fear that a resurgence in nationalistic sentiment could trigger a return to war , there are worries that it could affect the hopes of successfully completing a transformation to democracy and acceptance into the eu and nato . sanader was also quick to state his party ’ s willingness for international cooperation , “ we will be responsible for all international obligations , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal . ”
he added that this stance was not an electoral trick but a responsible policy .
his comments were aimed at stressing the reformed nature of the party , which claims to have abandoned past defiance under tudjman , who backed bosnian croat separatists and had a poor human rights record . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue .

mafia-like criminal gangs are making huge profits from the illegal meat trade with little risk of being caught and punished .
wales is becoming the centre for the illegal production of so-called smokies - a delicacy made from carcasses which are primitively blow-torched .
the cracking down on meat crime organised by the chartered institute of environmental health -lrb- cieh -rrb- , is warning delegates at the conference that urgent action needs to be taken to curb what is becoming a multi-million pound industry .
it wants to see more resources set aside to tackle the problem and tougher sentencing for those involved .
there have already been convictions following the illegal slaughter and sale of animals in west wales .
in june this year carmello gale , from penlan farchog , penrhiwllan , llandysul , jailed for four months after being found guilty of illegally transporting meat for the smokie market .
it is believed that the foot-and-mouth epidemic of 2001 put the dangers of illegal meat onto the national agenda for the first time .
since then , some steps have been taken to address the challenges presented by meat crime , but the cieh claim they are not enough . "
no single organisation , agency or government department can stamp out this criminality on its own " julie barratt , cieh the concern is that if the trade is left unchecked , it could seriously affect the meat industry and public health .
several hundred animals have been slaughtered illegally in west wales and sold on as smokies to ethnic communities in london .
the meat is a west african delicacy produced whent he skin of a sheep or oat is blow-torched to give a characteristic flavour .
julie barratt , cieh director for wales , said people resorted to meat crime - in particular producing smokies - as a means of " supplementing their incomes " .
" this has a number of serious implications for wales , " she said , " including the loss of its worldwide reputation for the production of high quality lamb and may put the european protected status for welsh lamb into jeopardy . "
but according to national farmers union cymru president peredur hughes the illegal market could be stopped if a legal way of production was formulated .
in a speech at the conference he said : " there is a market for this trade .
we should try and establish a legitimate and lawful way in which this market can be satisfied . "
the conference is designed to highlight the full seriousness of meat crime , to encourage a more coordinated approach by government and enforcement agencies to tackle it , and to look at ways of ensuring that the punishment handed down fits the crime .
mrs barratt said the food chain is a long and complicated one .
" no single organisation , agency or government department can stamp out this criminality on its own .
" we need to build strategic partnerships , where all parties adopt the same level of responsibility and commitment in order to prevent criminal gangs from exploiting enforcement loopholes . "
