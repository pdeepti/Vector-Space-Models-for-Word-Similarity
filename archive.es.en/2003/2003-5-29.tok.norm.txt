valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .

but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?

this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the labor pains of an eu constitution the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels earlier in may to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .

the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .

the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the labor pains of an eu constitution the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels earlier in may to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .

it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 29.05.2003 delegates see david vs. goliath struggle at eu convention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convention chairman valery giscard d 'estaing has been accused of favoring the eu 's larger nations .
the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .

this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 29.05.2003 delegates see david vs. goliath struggle at eu convention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convention chairman valery giscard d 'estaing has been accused of favoring the eu 's larger nations .
the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the labor pains of an eu constitution the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels earlier in may to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .

this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 29.05.2003 delegates see david vs. goliath struggle at eu convention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : convention chairman valery giscard d 'estaing has been accused of favoring the eu 's larger nations .
the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .
" do we want a directorate in europe where the big six states decide everything ?
if so , it will be the end of the european union . " permanent presidency at the heart of the controversy are proposals to create a permanent president or chairman of the european council .
this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .
the larger countries are complaining that this reduces the effectiveness and dilutes the focus of the presidency . the new text also suggests limiting the size of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies , to 15 executive members .
presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .
eu governments will then have until next spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the labor pains of an eu constitution the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels earlier in may to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .

valery giscard d 'estaing , head of the eu constitutional convention , is being awarded the charlemagne prize for his efforts in european integration .
but the former french president is not without his critics . on thursday , valery giscard d 'estaing , former president of france and the current chairman of the convention on the future of europe , will be awarded the charlemagne prize - one of germany 's greatest honors . the prize , awarded every year since 1950 , is given to a prominent politician who has made a significant contribution to european integration - it 's the highest honor awarded to a politician working in that area , akin to the nobel peace prize .
the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .

the prize is named after charlemagne -lrb- karl the great in germany -rrb- , the french emperor who from 800 through 814 successfully united europe under one ruler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi .
as chairman of the convention , giscard d 'estaing has spent the last two-and-a-half years - along with 105 other members of the convention - hammering out the draft of a constitution for europe .
the constitution is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions before enlargement increases the number of members from 15 to 25 in 2004 .
given the delicate nature of the task , giscard d 'estaing , not surprisingly , has both supporters and critics . paving the way for european integration the 78-year-old frenchman has a special relationship to germany : he was born in koblenz , in the rhineland region in 1926 .
after completing his studies at an elite paris university , he was named finance minister and was later elected , in 1974 , as president of france . his roots as a booster of european unity go back far .
as president of france , he found a kindred spirit in former german chancellor helmut schmidt .
the german-french duo laid the foundations for monetary integration and the introduction of the euro . reborn as a euro politican at the start of the 1980 's , it appeared that giscard d 'estaing 's time as a high-ranking politician in france was over .
at the same time that schmidt was displaced by helmut kohl , giscard d 'estaing was forced to give up his post as president .
he had quarrelled with prime minister jacques chirac and then lost the election to francois mitterand . yet , giscard d 'estaing did not give up his dream of working at the top level of a united europe , and he remained an active supporter of further integration .
along with helmut schmidt , he founded the committee for european economic union in 1986 .
and he made his desire to hold another top position within the union well known . giscard d 'estaing had hoped to serve as president of the european central bank , but failed to attain the post .
later , he hoped to become general director of the international monetary union , but was likewise frustrated in his efforts . ultimately , he achieved his ambitions , and was named chairman of the convention on the future of europe at the laeken summit in december 2001 .
he was charged with the task of guiding the reform of european union 's institutions and drafting a constitution that would increase the efficiency and efficacy of the eu post enlargement . a blast from the past ? when giscard d 'estaing was first named to the position , some expressed concern that he was too old for the job , a politician who represented the past - not the forward thinking ambitions of a united europe .
some even called him the " opa of europe " -lrb- grandfather of europe -rrb- . yet giscard d 'estaing took complaints about his age in stride .
in fact , at times he even considered them a compliment , pointing out that general charles de gaulle was elected head of state at the ripe old age of 75 . european visionary or arrogant pot stirrer ? to some , giscard d 'estaing is a man with a vision .
others paint him as arrogant , stubborn , and prone to supporting the interests of larger states -lrb- namely germany , france , italy , spain , and poland -rrb- . indeed , giscard d 'estaing has done much to add fuel to the fire .
in april , he released his personal suggestions for the reform of the union without discussing them with other members of the convention . -lrb- among his suggestions : a permanent president for the european council , which would replace the current rotating presidency -rrb- . some claimed giscard d 'estaing was taking on the role of a figurative midwife who wanted to determine the sex of the child .
his colleagues reacted harshly , saying that giscard d 'estaing 's opinions were his own , and they did not represent those of the convention . what 's more , giscard d 'estaing also made known his position on the entry of turkey into the european union , saying that turkey simply was n't " european " and that its inclusion would result in the " end of the european union . "
his remarks came just weeks after the copenhagen eu summit , where leaders said they would not rule out the possibility of turkey joining the union as long as the present government continued to make the necessary democratic reforms . pushing the debate forward awarding giscard d 'estaing the charlemagne prize does not necessarily represent unconditional support on the part of the judges for his methods and opinions .
nonetheless , popular or not , his achievements have helped to foster and advance the much-needed debate over the future of europe . if things go the way giscard d 'estaing would like them to , the eu will emerge from the convention more efficient and better equipped to deal with the challenges of the future .
the extent to which one can credit giscard d 'estaing for the outcome may be open to debate , but he has certainly made a contribution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.05.2003 german government pushes to reform skilled crafts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's journeymen protest action to reform the country 's regulations on crafts and trades .
despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition . master craftsmen and women waved their hammers , chisels and sewing needles at the german government on wednesday in protest of its decision to loosen rigid regulations of 65 skilled trades .
the reforms , which were put forth by economics minister wolfgang clement , virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , and allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for master tailors , cobblers , tile layers , goldsmiths , and 61 other craftsmen , this means they will have to open up their ranks to lesser-qualified colleagues , who will begin to compete with them for customers .
up until now , only those craftsmen with the meisterbrief were allowed to start a company and employ journeymen and train apprentices .
for some 29 trades considered high-risk , such as electricians or opticians , the meisterbrief requirement still applies , but even here journeymen with 10 years of experience , including five years at the management level , will be able to open up a business .
in justifying his reform plans , clement said the changes were absolutely necessary because " profits and jobs are declining dramatically in the trades . "
the minister said the changes would ensure the future of craftsmanship and lead to the creation of new companies , jobs and apprenticeships , while at the same time reducing the number of people employed illegally .
clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

clement also pointed out that craftsmen from neighboring eu member states were able to start up companies in germany without having to show a meisterbrief or its equivalent .
with the eu expanding eastwards , the minister said that competition in germany among the crafts and trades will become even tougher .
the new reforms , therefore , put a stop to the " domestic discrimination " placed on german craftsmen , by allowing them to compete more fairly for contracts and customers .
destroying traditional structures the president of the national federation of german skilled crafts and trade -lrb- zdh -rrb- , dieter philipp , criticized clement ’ s plans saying that the reforms " do not mean modernization but instead the irreparable destruction of structures that are needed more than ever on the way toward a service and knowledge-driven society . "
philipp said the reforms had not been thought through and that the problems plaguing craftsmen were no different from those affecting the rest of the economy , namely the dramatic domestic economic situation and the absence of structural reforms .
enabling more people to become self-employed would not solve the problem , philipp added .
clement 's reform plan still requires approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where it faces opposition christian democratic union , which holds the majority of votes .
both the cdu and the business-friendly free democratic party say they favor retaining the meisterbrief as a guarantee for high quality german craftsmanship . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief skilled workers protest high taxes in berlin and munich ; court orders mandatory shelters for homeless ; fewer germans donate organs for transplant .

the latest draft constitution for the european union has created a furor , as some delegates to the convention on the future of europe fear it will consolidate power with the eu ’ s six biggest nations . the steering presidium of the convention on the future of europe has released a new working version of a constitution .
it is aimed at streamlining the eu ’ s institutions to make it capable of functioning when the bloc expands from 15 to 25 members next year . the 105-member convention , led by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing , is expected to debate the draft on friday and saturday .
but shortly after the latest text was made public earlier this week , some convention delegates sharply criticized what they saw as a power grab by europe ’ s six largest countries : germany , france , britain , italy , spain , and poland . " this is not acceptable to small member states , " elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament representing the christian democrats , told the reuters news agency .

this is where eu national leaders meet to set policy .
currently , the eu presidency is rotated every six months , with each member country government representing the bloc .

presently , each country is guaranteed one commissioner and larger nations have two .
the smaller nations , including nine candidate countries , want to see each member guaranteed a commissioner to protect their national interests in brussels . in what is seen as another concession to the larger countries , giscard d ’ estaing has agreed to preserve a national veto over important foreign policy issues .
both britain and france had been particularly reluctant to hamper their room for manoeuvre abroad . the draft constitution also backs a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile .
it wants to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commissioner for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . british backing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " no one could sensibly argue that a common foreign policy has tied our hands over the past decade , nor will it in the future , " british foreign secretary jack straw wrote in the wednesday edition of the times of london .
straw came out heavily in favor of the newest draft , saying it would offer britain a chance to shape the eu . countries will also retain a veto over tax policy , which had been a sensitive issue for both britain and ireland .
but qualified majority voting will be extended to a number of other areas and brussels will gain new competencies in the areas of asylum and immigration . the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at a summit in greece on june 20 .

the vote to cut 10bn shekels -lrb- $ 2.2bn ; £ 1.4bn -rrb- took hours as legislators worked through thousands of opposition amendments .
in the end , a walkout by opposition members of the 120-seat knesset , or parliament , meant the bill was passed 50-one .
a domestic slowdown and a surge in defence costs since the start of the palestinian uprising nearly three years ago have also taken their toll on the economy .
the finance ministry 's austerity proposals , including a cut in pension payouts and an increase in contributions , are the key to freeing up $ 9bn in loan guarantees the us has offered israel .
up in arms but the cuts have also sparked one of israel 's biggest ever public protests .
tens of thousands of angry israelis marched on the finance ministry earlier this week , threatening a general strike if the government went ahead with plans to cut pension benefits .
the protestors were addressed by a series of speakers who heaped criticism on finance minister benjamin netanyahu .
and earlier in may , the country was practically brought to a standstill by striking public sector workers , although the histadrut labour federation later reached a compromise with the ministry .
but the 10bn shekels slashed from the public sector budget - which , as mr netanyahu pointed out , comprises 55 % of gross domestic product - may not be enough .
the cuts as passed by the knesset are 1bn shekels lower than those originally proposed , and officials warn that they may well need to be reinstated .

the news came ahead of a vital executives ' meeting , at which the question of how to deal with the sk global unit 's debts needs to be addressed .
sk global is on the edge of bankruptcy after the unearthing of a $ 1.2bn accounting scandal in march .
on wednesday , sk global 's creditors threw out a bailout proposal suggested by sk group 's board and said they would seek a court receivership instead .
but in a statement released ahead of the executive meeting , sk group chairman son kil-seung pledged to protect the company 's future .
" we 'll certainly save sk global , " he said - although he gave no details about how .
the result was a 30.7 % leap in the share price to 3,000 won at one point , although by 0530 gmt the stock was trading at 2,700 won , up 350 won or 15 % .
ugly fight in the meantime , though , the argument about how to rescue sk global - if at all - rages on .
sk global owes $ 7.5bn , of which $ 6.5bn is owed to koreans .
the bulk of that is in the hands of a group of 11 companies being represented by hana bank , which seized control of sk global in march and gave the parent three months to sort things out .
they have demanded that their debt is swapped for new shares in the trading unit , but reports say sk 's offer is for only about half a billion dollars ' worth .
the fight is now getting uglier , after sk group was cut off from oil sold by its parent , the biggest refiner in the country .
sk corp says the trading unit 's creditors are refusing to pay for supplies and freezing credit lines to force its hand .
last year , the group sold about 40 % of its refined oil production through sk global .

new figures show that the economy contracted 0.5 % in the three months from january to march , broadly in line with predictions but well down on the 2.4 % growth shown in october-december .
that still left gross domestic product 4.5 % higher than it was in march last year , but the slowdown from 5.8 % growth in the year to december was marked .
it could threaten the government 's chances of making enough off tax receipts to reduce a budget deficit estimated at 4.5 % of gdp , not to mention the government 's own growth target of 4.2-5.2 % in 2003 .
knock-on effect although the philippines has escaped the worst of the deadly sars respiratory virus , with only 12 cases and two deaths , thousands of filipinos work in some of the hardest hit locations such as hong kong and singapore .

the highest point in the world was named after the victorian geographer sir george everest .
born in crickhowell , breconshire , in 1790 , sir george later became surveyor general of india .
his job entailed making and commissioning maps and he was the first british authority to report on the existence of the mountain .
it was his work on refining and perfecting trigonometrical equipment that enabled an accurate measurement of its height .
that won the welshman the honour of having the peak named after him .
my father got all the guests out of bed and told them if they did not get up they would be thrown out jane pullee on the day everest was first climbed it was in the mountains of snowdonia that the successful british expedition under sir john hunt trained in 1952 , testing out the tactics and equipment that led to the climbing of everest by sir edmund hillary and sherpa tenzing norgay the following year .
midnight phone call pen-y-gwryd hotel in nantgwynant was the social centre and meeting place for six months for the expedition , and next month the surviving members will meet for a reunion , as they have done regularly since 1953 .
sign of the times : everest now has an internet cafe the hotel was a mecca for climbers and the owners were chris and jo briggs and their daughter jane , then aged only 10 .
she remembers a phone call at midnight on 1 june , 1953 .
" it was from the times , telling my parents that the expedition had done it , " she said .
" my father got all the guests out of bed and told them if they did not get up they would be thrown out . "
that morning , the guests were treated to a champagne celebration .
today , the walls of the hotel are lined with memorabilia of the expedition and jane , now mrs pullee , treasures the picture of her taken with expedition leader sir john hunt .
she said : " those involved in the expedition became a family and my parents really were part of the everest family . "
caradog jones was the first welshman to make it up everest the welsh connection continues with charles evans , a surgeon from the vale of clwyd who later became the head of the university of wales , bangor , and lived in capel curig .
oxygen equipment he could have been the first to reach the top of everest as the lead climber of the expedition .
he and climbing partner tom bourdillon set out on the first attempt to reach the summit on 27 may , but they had trouble with their oxygen equipment and had to turn back , just 300 feet short .
you can see the curvature of the earth at that altitude , so it 's definitely a somewhat surreal experience caradog jones so , fate stopped a welsh foot being the first on the top , and two days later it was hillary and tenzing who made the successful ascent .
mrs pullee will be at the official celebrations in london on thursday , culminating at an evening royal gala , at the odeon cinema , leicester square .
there will also be an afternoon event featuring film and speakers on everest ... and yet another welsh connection .
one of the speakers will be welsh author jan morris , who was the times correspondent with the expedition and was the first to get back the news to the world .
she will be making the trip from her home in gwynedd to take part .
newspaper scoop welshman on top of the world : caradog jones in 1995 it was one of the classic newspaper scoops , reaching britain on the day of the queen 's coronation .
fewer than 50 britons have made the summit , and the first welshman to get there was caradog jones in 1995 .
he said his team had been under a lot of pressure to persuade those below that they had the strength to carry on .
mr jones told bbc wales : " you 're actually climbing out of the protective layer of the atmosphere .
" you have this feeling of a great thickness above you when you 're at home , but you suddenly realise that you 've climbed out of it .
frostbite " you can see the curvature of the earth at that altitude , so it 's definitely a somewhat surreal experience . "
another welshman , eric jones has been up everest twice as a cameraman , but never to the summit .
but he had frostbite and he said he had not thought it was worth the risk of losing his fingers to get to the top .
mr jones said he objected to the number of inexperienced climbers who were now going up the mountain on commercial expeditions .
" it 's all down to money , " said mr jones .
" the nepalese and chinese government get vast amounts of money from these expeditions , so i 'm afraid they are just going to take as many as they get .
" but the problem is there are so many inexperienced climbers on everest and if they are caught high up in a storm they are likely to die . "

jan berry , the police federation chairman and herself a kent officer , is expected to urge the 11 forces named to speed up their body armour programmes at a conference in london on thursday .
kent police announced a £ 1m project to give all their frontline staff bullet and stab proof vests early in 2002 .

demand outstripping supply a further 900 vests still have to be ordered to supply all 2,500 frontline officers with armour .
the force said the delay in the roll-out was down to demand for the armour outstripping supply by the manufacturers .
peter philpot , assistant chief constable for kent police , said : " i can not over-criticise the manufacturers and this is n't trying to blame someone else because i think they have more forces than just kent to deal with .
" it 's a question of waiting and i think most of our front-line officers are aware that the problem is with them and not with the force . "
' too dangerous ' the order should be completed by the end of the year , he said .
a kent police spokesman said the armour had been prioritised to the county 's busiest areas , with 92 % of officers in gravesend and dartford and 97 % of those working in medway now equipped .
sussex police have yet to choose a supplier for their body armour .
senior officers for the force said the county was so safe the vests had not been a priority until now .
ms berry has stressed the importance of the body armour programme .
she has said " policing is too dangerous a profession to not supply people with armour " and that " it seems some forces are waiting for the number of assaults to rise before taking steps to properly equip and protect their officers " .
