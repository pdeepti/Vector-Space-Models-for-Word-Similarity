schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .

it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution current affairs -pipe- 09.07.2003 eu constitution negotiations draw to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention members toast their draft constitution at the european parliament in brussels .
germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .
she added that she considered it unlikely that the conference of government leaders would get the job done by december .
she said it was more likely that the accord would end up as the treaty of dublin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution current affairs -pipe- 09.07.2003 eu constitution negotiations draw to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention members toast their draft constitution at the european parliament in brussels .
germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "

the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .
she added that she considered it unlikely that the conference of government leaders would get the job done by december .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
a working group of 50 researchers will now pore over the rosewood files for at least six months , trying to unravel the maze of statistics , codes , abbreviations , short forms and key words marked on the thousands of personal index cards and filter out the relevant details .
helmut müller-enbergs gave an example of the painstaking task lying ahead when he presented one of the grainy stasi index cards with critical details blacked out . he said the document had helped archivists identify one particularly active spy in west germany who was recruited in 1948 and who the stasi had rewarded with a volkswagen car worth 5,700 deutsche marks in 1952 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9797 dw-tv europe live europa aktuell we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .

marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany .

most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
a working group of 50 researchers will now pore over the rosewood files for at least six months , trying to unravel the maze of statistics , codes , abbreviations , short forms and key words marked on the thousands of personal index cards and filter out the relevant details .
helmut müller-enbergs gave an example of the painstaking task lying ahead when he presented one of the grainy stasi index cards with critical details blacked out . he said the document had helped archivists identify one particularly active spy in west germany who was recruited in 1948 and who the stasi had rewarded with a volkswagen car worth 5,700 deutsche marks in 1952 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .
she added that she considered it unlikely that the conference of government leaders would get the job done by december .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
a working group of 50 researchers will now pore over the rosewood files for at least six months , trying to unravel the maze of statistics , codes , abbreviations , short forms and key words marked on the thousands of personal index cards and filter out the relevant details .
helmut müller-enbergs gave an example of the painstaking task lying ahead when he presented one of the grainy stasi index cards with critical details blacked out . he said the document had helped archivists identify one particularly active spy in west germany who was recruited in 1948 and who the stasi had rewarded with a volkswagen car worth 5,700 deutsche marks in 1952 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .
she added that she considered it unlikely that the conference of government leaders would get the job done by december .
she said it was more likely that the accord would end up as the treaty of dublin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 files could shed new light on east german spies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a number and a card - the highly sensitive rosewood files on former east german spies have arrived in germany from the u.s. the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .
the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .

west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .

marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .

birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .

several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .

" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2003 italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chancellor gerhard schröder 's annual trip to italy become a thing of the past ?
germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .
" we 're waiting for the chancellor with great anticipation , " palmiro ucchielli , president of the palmiro province .
the " stupidity " of the northern league , he said , " speaks for itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .
she added that she considered it unlikely that the conference of government leaders would get the job done by december .
she said it was more likely that the accord would end up as the treaty of dublin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .

it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
a working group of 50 researchers will now pore over the rosewood files for at least six months , trying to unravel the maze of statistics , codes , abbreviations , short forms and key words marked on the thousands of personal index cards and filter out the relevant details .
helmut müller-enbergs gave an example of the painstaking task lying ahead when he presented one of the grainy stasi index cards with critical details blacked out . he said the document had helped archivists identify one particularly active spy in west germany who was recruited in 1948 and who the stasi had rewarded with a volkswagen car worth 5,700 deutsche marks in 1952 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .
it also took the hysteria one step further , citing a current " highly contagious " measles epidemic in italy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian official calls german tourists arrogant nationalists www-links the tuscan fraction in german only tui in german only 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .
senior german ministers outraged senior ministers in schröder ’ s government also expressed their anger at italian tourism minister and member of the far-right northern league stefano stefani ’ s derogatory comments about german tourists in a letter to a newspaper and have urged stefani to step down .
" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .
german parliamentarians could also be named birthler also said that the new information gleaned from the rosewood files would be used to examine members of parliament or public servants including members of her own department if need be .
several media reports had indicated last that members of parliament are among those listed in the files .
mps have been accused of spying in the past , but none of the charges have been proven .
at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .
it also drew attention to the draconian methods employed by the east german police in persuading or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends .
more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
a working group of 50 researchers will now pore over the rosewood files for at least six months , trying to unravel the maze of statistics , codes , abbreviations , short forms and key words marked on the thousands of personal index cards and filter out the relevant details .
helmut müller-enbergs gave an example of the painstaking task lying ahead when he presented one of the grainy stasi index cards with critical details blacked out . he said the document had helped archivists identify one particularly active spy in west germany who was recruited in 1948 and who the stasi had rewarded with a volkswagen car worth 5,700 deutsche marks in 1952 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies . it has all the makings of a classic cold war drama - intrigue , suspense , betrayal and the thrill of lurking danger .
in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .
over the last three years , the highly sensitive material was copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany .
rosenwood files a crucial spoke in the wheel now , a week after chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s office announced the data was declassified and could be used for research , intense media speculation over the potential significance of the rosenwood files has been confirmed by the german authority in charge of stasi records .
" this is the first time in the history of espionage that the intelligence agency of a dictatorship will be laid so bare , " helmut müller-enbergs from the research department told a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" right from the source to the end user - the politburo , the industry , the military - the information ring is now complete .
and " rosewood " is the central hinge between source , actual names and numbers . "
marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany . " the rosewood files are indeed believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names .
west german spies also in the list the authorities also said that of the some 200,000 names included on the microfilm copies of personal index cards , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 agents who worked in the former east .
the daily berliner zeitung reported that most of the east germans had worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west and had remained unexposed so far , while many of the west germans participated either for the money or out of personal conviction .
however marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive told the paper on monday that she did not expect the documents to yield any sensational discoveries .
" in the future it will be easier to find out who worked with the stasi in west germany .
insight into the network of agents in east germany is also possible .
but i warn against exaggerated expectations , " she said .
birthler also said many of those named on the cards were relatives , colleagues or friends of spies and only a small number actually worked as east german agents .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .

" if i were the italian head of government , that man would no longer be in office , " interior minister otto schily said in a television interview .
economy and labor minister wolfgang clement also the mass-selling tabloid bild that stefani " should be taken out of circulation . "
anger is mounting in germany over a double set of insults that italy has hurled at it in recent days .
first it was italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and current head of the rotating eu presidency , who compared a german member of the eu parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard during his debut speech to the european parliament last week .
then on friday , stefani in an open letter described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well - these stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes , who have been indoctrinated ... to feel top of the class whatever the situation .
they noisily invade our beaches , " the minister wrote .
though senior italian ministers including foreign minister franco frattini have distanced themselves from mr stefani ’ s comments , neither berlusconi nor stefani have offered apologies for their remarks , instead opting to express regret or clarification .
schily : " not good publicity for italy " italian officials are now alarmed that the souring of diplomatic ties between the two countries might affect tourism , with germans accounting for 40 percent of all foreign tourists to italy .
interior minister schily acknowledged that german tourists made for an important economic factor in italy and there was " worldwide competition for german tourists . "
he however pointed out that " those who kick you in the shins and spit at you must not be surprised that that is not good publicity for their country .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .
" we 're waiting for the chancellor with great anticipation , " palmiro ucchielli , president of the palmiro province .
the " stupidity " of the northern league , he said , " speaks for itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

germany 's chancellor has threatened to cancel his vacation in italy in response to a nasty letter from a top italian tourism official .
the letter described german tourists as a horde of arrogant , nationalist blondes . with two major anti-german slurs from senior italian officials within the space of a week , diplomatic tensions between germany and italy are heating up .
first , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi compared a german politician to a nazi concentration camp guard as he took up the rotating presidency of the european union .
then , on friday , a top italian tourism official in rome called german tourists arrogant nationalists and stereotypical blondes .
in an open letter published by la padania , the party newspaper of the right-wing and anti-immigration northern league , deputy tourism minister stefano stefani described germany as a " country intoxicated with arrogant certainties . "
" we know the germans well , these stereotyped blondes with a hyper-nationalist pride who have always been indoctrinated to be first in the class at any cost , " he wrote .
after learning of the comments this week , schröder threatened to cancel his annual trip to italy , where he has spent his vacation for a number of years .
his spokesman , bela anda , said the remarks were a " blanket insult to all germans who like to spend their vacations in italy . "
the less-than-subtle german tabloid bild , also the subject of stefani 's xenophobic tirade , lashed back on tuesday as well , writing , " they 're crazy , those romans " and asking if stefani had " spaghetti for brains ? "
in a separate editorial , the paper also made gibes at stefani in broken german , imitating the accent of many italians who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefano stefani in his letter , stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- also wrote that germans " noisily invade our beaches , but their most widely read newspaper bild never forgets to mention the number of car thefts in rimini or the latest mafia death statistics in sicily . "
he also criticized the news magazine der spiegel for putting a picture of berlusconi on the cover with the title " the godfather " , in reference to the prime minister ’ s many legal woes .
facing heavy criticism , stefani sought on tuesday to defuse the controversy by publishing a second letter in la padania .
in the missive , he invited schröder to spend time with him during his holiday in italy so he could show the chancellor that he gets along well with germans " who are different from -lrb- martin -rrb- schulz . "
stefani , who was married to a german woman for 20 years , said his quotes had been taken out of context .
instead , he said , they were meant as insults against schulz , the german social democrat in the european parliament who was the subject of berlusconi 's vicious attack last week .
schulz has been an outspoken critic of berlusconi 's conflicts of interest as simultaneous prime minister and owner of italy 's largest private broadcaster .
local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .

local officials call for resignation tourism officials in the adriatic sea region are continuing to mobilize to undo the damage .
" we 're still the same friends we 've always been , " said guido pasi , tourism director for the emilia romagna region , which is home to the popular beach resort rimini .
the stakes are high in a region where every second visitor comes from germany .
if schröder were to cancel his visit over the spat , officials fear , it could be disastrous for the region since it would send a symbolic gesture to other germans if there own leader were to boycott italy .
at least 10 million germans are estimated to travel to italy each year , spending a total of € 7 billion there .
officials in regions along the adriatic coastline have accused stefani of seriously damaging the tourism industry .
they have demanded that he either offer an official apology or resign from his post .
opposition politicians have made similar demands .
but so far the italian government has not officially apologized for the letter .
a half-hearted response in a written statement , italian foreign minister franco fattini confirmed only that there is a deep relationship that binds the italian and german people .
the controversial remarks made by the deputy minister for tourism were " unfounded " and represented stefani 's opinion only and not those of the government , fattini wrote .
nor did fattini wish that the incident harm the traditional friendship between italy and germany .
german tourists , he wrote , know that they are welcomed in italy .
but fattini stopped short of officially apologizing on rome 's behalf for the remarks , just as berlusconi failed to apologize for his nazi gibe at the european parliament in strasbourg the previous week .
neither has fattini or any other official in the government publicly threatened to sanction or fire stefani for his behavior .
on tuesday stefani 's boss , industry minister antonio marzano , also distanced himself and the italian government from the anti-german statements .
schröder spokesman bela anda said tuesday afternoon the german government was " satisfied " with fattini and marzano 's statements distancing the government from stefani .
but the tersely worded statement left open whether schröder would still travel to italy . " in the interest of friendly relations between italy and germany , the federal government is assuming that the statements of both ministers represent the view of the italian government and that they will not be revised , " anda wrote . last week , berlusconi backtracked from statements of regret over his statements in strasbourg and officials in berlin hope the same thing does n't occur in the wake of stefani 's insults .
many italians hope , despite all the bad blood , the latest row will quickly disappear .
" we 're waiting for the chancellor with great anticipation , " palmiro ucchielli , president of the palmiro province .
the " stupidity " of the northern league , he said , " speaks for itself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi refutes apology for nazi remark did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?

in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .
after years of wrangling between the german government and united states authorities , the u.s. finally agreed to hand over the so-called rosewood files .

in 1992 shortly after the collapse of the communist east german regime , the cia managed to get hold of thousands of secret documents on east germany ’ s secret police , the stasi , reportedly from a russian kgb officer who had worked in east berlin .

marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive , said in a statement : ' ' this will help the historical reappraisal of espionage against west germany .

at the same time , birthler said she did not expect a wave of new espionage trials , since hundreds of agents who spied on west germany had already been investigated and pointed out that a ten-year statue of limitations on prosecuting spying activity had expired .
2.4 million people spied upon the first stasi files were opened in 1990 and led to bitter recriminations and separations after the discovery that family and neighbors were stasi informers .

germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .
the shadow of the recent german-italian spat looms over the negotiations . as the convention drawing up the first-ever european union constitution prepares to conclude its negotiations , germany has won a key concession allowing member states to retain control over migrant labor coming from outside the eu .
but it was a compromise ruling .
foreign minister joschka fischer failed to secure member states ' veto rights over general immigration and refugee policy as germany requested .
instead , the convention consented to a ruling on the granting of work permits by individual member states .
issues such as the rights of family members to follow immigrants to their host countries or minimum social standards for refugees will be decided by qualified majority voting by the council of ministers .
veto remains for key policy areas convention delegates are said to have been taken aback by fischer 's push for the retention of this particular veto right , given that he has campaigned for more qualified majority voting in areas such as foreign policy , defense and taxation .
these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .
speaking to deutsche welle , amato said , " if i have my veto power , i do n't care about reaching an agreement .
i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "
but those calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears .
rome signing in doubt once the convention completes its deliberations , a conference of eu government leaders will take over the job of finalizing the draft .
silvio berlusconi , the prime minister of italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , says he aims to have the constitution formally adopted in a signing ceremony in rome , echoing the treaty of rome , which established the eu 's forerunner , the european economic community , in 1958 .
but the chances of the constitution being signed , sealed and delivered during italy 's presidency appear to be growing slimmer by the day , especially as the controversy over anti-german remarks made by berlusconi and a junior minister responsible for tourism , stefano stefani , refuses to die down .
the financial times deutschland has quoted eu sources in brussels as saying ireland , which assumes the six-month rotating presidency in january , is already planning for the contingency that italy fails to get the constitution in the bag before the end of the year .
it quotes a diplomat in brussels as saying dublin 's worst case scenario is that the italian government will fall apart by year 's end .
it goes on to say that even the netherlands , who take charge after ireland , are making emergency plans .
in germany , the opposition neo-liberal free democratic party has said it does not believe italy is a suitable place for the signing of the constitution , given the latest outbursts .
european affairs spokeswoman sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said the furore would cast a shadow over the constitution .

these portfolios are viewed by many members , especially britain , as crucial to national sovereignty , and it appears london will get its way , despite energetic efforts by the vice president of the convention , giuliano amato , who said veto rights undermined the scope for compromise .

i do n't move , i do n't go towards the others .
if i understand that a decision might be taken by majority voting , i feel interested and motivated in looking for an agreement with the others , and an agreement is eventually reached . "
amato added that it was time europeans realized that decisions taken by majority voting by the council of ministers did not automatically threaten their national identity .
european commissioner , günther verheugen , who belongs to germany 's social democrats , said the eu could only advance its international interests by abolishing veto rights on foreign policy decisions .
in an interview with the german tv news station , n-tv , he said " in addition to a european foreign minister , who develops initiatives , we also need a procedure that guarantees that in future crises , we can say to the americans what the european position is . "

schröder may have cancelled his annual italian vacation , but 10 million germans visit italy each year .
dw-world takes a look at the german love affair with the mediterranean boot . " o , how happy i feel in rome ! , " goethe wrote in a poem inspired by his travels through italy in the late 1700s .
germany 's most famous philosopher , poet and novelist probably had no idea what kind of trend he started when , in his own words , he swapped germany 's dull sky for italy 's gay one .
today , italy ranks as one of the top holiday destinations for germans , second only to spain .
every year some 10 million germans pack their swimming trunks and head over the alps into italy on their summer vacation .
something for everyone after goethe set the - albeit high brow - trend for italian travel , germany 's haute bourgeoisie followed suit in the 19th century .
with their infamous ‘ baedeker " books firmly in tow , the posh and well-heeled vacationers travelled through italy as part of the standard grand tour around europe .
it wasn ’ t until the 1950s that the love affair with the mediterranean flair really spread north to germany for all to enjoy .
" after world war ii , when money was tight and air travel still expensive , italy was the obvious choice for people -lsb- in germany -rsb- , especially if they could afford a car , " robin zimmermann , spokesperson for german tour operator tui , told deutsche welle .
" it was easy for them to pack up and drive over the alps to the italian riviera to go on holiday . "
tui , europe 's largest tour operator , books more italian holidays for germans than any other group and says that the country has everything a tourist could want , from skiing in the dolomite mountains , wind surfing on lake garda , to roman ruins in the capital , and of course , plenty of sun .
" italy has so many different sides , " zimmermann , said explaining italy 's draw for so many germans .
" there are beaches , wonderful countryside , culture , great food and amazing culture .
there is something there for everyone . "
tuscan fraction - et in arcadia ego surprisingly , it 's germany 's politicians who are at the forefront of the love affair with italy .
like his british counterpart , tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder has spent his annual holiday in the northern italian region of tuscany for a number of years .
other top german politicians join schröder in the famed " tuscan fraction " .
the term , coined at the end of the kohl era in the late 1980s , singled out german politicians with left-wing sympathies and a penchant for spaghetti , chianti and warm summer evenings al fresco .
the clique includes interior minister otto schily , who speaks fluent italian and has enjoyed a long friendship with former italian communist trade unionist and restaurateur gianni brunelli , as well as foreign minister joschka fischer .
the popular foreign minister , who is said to have been introduced to the region by schily , has a well-documented love for tuscany 's landscape and gastronomy .
in his book , mein langer lauf zu mich selbst -lrb- " my long run to myself " -rrb- , the 55-year-old waxed lyrical about the rolling tuscan hills south of siena and the region 's " wonderful " pecorino cheese .
the exclusive group of teutonic tuscan holiday makers also includes failed chancellor candidate oskar lafontaine from the social democrats , president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse and schleswig-holstein state premier heide simonis , who has a villa near pisa .
damage done ?
whether or not the intense infatuation with the country can withstand recent comments made by italy 's deputy tourism minister stefani stefano is still to be seen .
however , stefano ’ s remarks referring to germans as " stereotyped blondes with a hyper nationalist pride " who overpopulate the country ’ s beaches certainly couldn ’ t have come at a more inopportune time as half the country gets ready to go on summer holiday .
the tuscan fraction , for its part , will have to decide just how seriously it wants to take italy ’ s anti-german comments by boycotting their favorite vacation destination .
the first inklings of german resentiment may already be in the works .
on wednesday evening chancellor gerhard schröder announced he would not be taking his annual holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna , but would spend it in his home town of hanover .
the german media was divided over what schröder should do .
the süddeutsche zeitung from munich offered eight reasons why schröder should still take his holiday in rimini , among them : " because if we do n't we 'll think italian food we get in germany is the same as the real thing , " and " because we need italy 's women . "
hot-headed mass circulation tabloid bild went to the other extreme , however .
" schröder , take your holiday in germany ! " it screamed , juxtaposing photos of german tourist spots in bavaria and picture postcards of the famed baltic coast with a crowded beach scene in rimini .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2003 are germany 's unions paralyzed ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall 's recent strike in the east has thrown the german labor movement into a deep crisis .
after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .
dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread . in june , germany 's mighty metals and engineering union ig metall took to the picket lines .
workers at automobile supply plants across eastern germany dropped their tools in an effort to win support for their demand for the 35-hour work week western germans have enjoyed for years .
but in a time of economic stagnation , the strike backfired .
there was little support among eastern workers and public sentiment turned sharply against ig metall after the strikes began to affect production at car factories in western germany – the source of what are arguably the country 's most-important exports .
in a move that could have dire consequences for the future of the labor movement here , ig metall raised the white flag , surrendering its demands , sending its workers back to the job .
in the days since the strike ended , a nasty and very public power struggle has broken out between the union 's outgoing leader , klaus zwickel , and his handpicked successor , jürgen peters , whom many at ig metall have blamed for the strike debacle .
zwickel has called for peters ' resignation , but the man tapped to lead the union has dug in his heels and is refusing to go .
in an interview on tuesday , hagen lesch , who leads the labor policy center at the cologne institute for business research , discussed ig metall 's current crisis and its ramifications for germany 's politically dominant unions .
ig metall is experiencing its worst crisis since world war ii .
what does its defeat and current leadership crisis mean for its future ?
even before the failed strike and subsequent leadership struggle , ig metall stood before a fundamental decision .
the question is whether the union wants to be an active participant in questions not only of wage policies , but also in labor reforms -lrb- the government has proposed -rrb- , or whether it wants to position itself as a type of fundamental political opposition .
the need for this discussion has become even clearer through the events of the past two weeks .
do you think ig metall 's crisis will have an impact on germany 's other influential unions ?
ig metall plays an extremely strong leadership role in germany 's labor movement , it 's the trailblazer , as it were .
but the labor movement in germany is far from homogenous , and there are other unions that have far different wage negotiation policies than those of ig metall .
ig chemical , for example , is a very consensus-oriented union .
during the past 30 years , there have been no labor battles or strikes in the chemicals industry .
they 've created wage contracts that contain a high level of flexibility that does n't exist in the metals and engineering industry .
ig chemical 's example shows that some unions have advanced much further than ig metall , whose negotiations seldom come without warning strikes or other noisy tactics .
in that sense , i do n't think ig metall will be the trendsetter anymore .
in the past , ig metall was successful in negotiating its demands .
what went wrong this time ?
the metalworkers union went on strike in a region where it hardly had a base .
less than 10 percent of the workers in the eastern metal and engineering industries supported the strike .
political sentiment is also crucial , and it was directed against the union from the start .
besides , in a period of economic stagnation , it 's difficult to make a compelling negotiation for a three-hour reduction in the work week . ig metall argued that the work could just be redistributed amongst more workers , without cutting down on production .
but this would require additional workers and would have raised wage costs for companies by 9 percent – an increase that ultimately would have raised prices on products and consequently reduced demand .
in eastern germany , -lrb- where unemployment runs as high as 19 percent in some areas -rrb- , people are just happy to have jobs and they were afraid that the added wage costs would have reduced their competitiveness and put their jobs at risk .
ig metall obviously badly misjudged the situation .
during the past decade , membership in german unions has dropped .
what do you think is causing this trend ?
there are a number of influencing factors .
in addition to a drop in the absolute number of members , we 've also determined that the membership structure of unions has changed .
we now have fewer active workers in union and , on the other side , we have an increasing number of pensioners who are still members but are no longer actively working .
in other words , we 're seeing the aging of our unions .
during the 1990s , most job growth was in the services sector , with the number of jobs in industry stagnating .
meanwhile , unemployment has risen sharply , leading many to drop out of the unions .
in addition to this structural change , we 're also seeing the individualization of society as well as the individualization of the working world .
standardized regulations do n't apply as well as they once did – now there is greater demand for wage policies that are directed at specific businesses and sometimes even individual workers .
ig metall 's inability to adapt to these demands has weakened the acceptance of a union – especially with young people , who are already underrepresented in the union .
do you think germany 's unions are losing their political influence ?
no , their political influence has n't been weakened .
close to 25 percent of all workers are union members .
it 's become a minority of the population , but half the members of germany 's parliament are card-holding union members .
through this interlocking of unions and politics , the unions ' influence is actually far greater than its -lrb- membership -rrb- would justify .
because of their power , the unions are also given seats on powerful committees , like the federal labor office , which implements the country 's labor policies .
but the most important element is the power the unions secure through the interlocking of unions and members of parliament .
but there are signs that the influence is waning , as we saw earlier this year when the unions failed to block the government 's plans to extend shopping hours on saturdays .
since then , you 've also seen signs of that with chancellor gerhard schröder 's agenda 2010 reform plans .
the fact that schröder is pushing through reforms that will loosen hiring and firing laws and ease other labor market regulations shows that the government has undergone a certain amount of emancipation from the unions .
in fact that is really happening , but it 's a very new development that has n't really fully emerged .
some unions are doing an about-face and are once again engaging in dialogue with the government after learning that fundamental opposition has had little impact .
but it 's difficult to determine to what degree this will develop .
what conditions led to this " emancipation " ?
the acute problems we 're having with the labor market have led to this .
for a long time , the government thought the job market could fix itself through positive economic developments .
but in times of economic stagnation , reducing unemployment requires other measures , and the government has now realized this .
many of germany 's neighbors reformed their labor markets long ago , including sweden , denmark and the netherlands , which have long had more flexible labor laws .
then , of course , there 's great britain , a country whose labor market has hardly any regulations .
these other countries have demonstrated that the employment dynamic increases considerably more when you have a flexible labor market .
now , the german government appears to have learned that lesson .
but many unions in germany have expressed their opposition to chancellor schröder 's labor market and social reforms .
all in all , unions like ig metall and ver.di are against any kind of encroachment on the living standards of their classic clientele .
they do n't want hiring and firing laws to be loosened , nor do they want restrictions that lead , de facto , to the inability to terminate older employees .
and classical ideas still prevail inside many unions ... the currents of traditionalists and those who are more reform-oriented have n't flown together yet .
and when you 're in the middle of such a difficult and public discussion , it 's obviously very difficult to provide constructive reform proposals .
in this arena , the government has made more progress than the unions .
many have suggested that ig metall 's failed strike marks a turning point in the history of unions in germany .
now , they wo n't be taken as seriously as they have been in the past .
in the short-term i do n't think the discussion over ig metall is going to diminish the influence of unions in germany .
independent of the leadership debate happening there and the lost strike , there was already a level of emancipation occurring between the government and unions .
the government is pushing through reforms of the labor market as well as the public health funds and public retirement plan .
the most decisive factor is going to be to what degree politics is able to cut itself off from the union in order to push needed reforms through .
at the same time , there 's the question of whether the unions will remain in fundamental opposition to the government 's policies , as we have seen in italy and france , or whether they will become constructive participants in the process .
if the unions take the latter road , they will remain influential . interview conducted by daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beleaguered deputy gets aggressive in german union dispute the ongoing power struggle over the leadership of germany ’ s giant ig metall union has come to an open rupture between ig metall chairman klaus zwickel and his designated successor , jürgen peters .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has cancelled his planned vacation to italy laying to rest intense media speculation after italy ’ s tourism minister called german tourists “ stereotyped hyper-nationalistic blondes . ” the escalating diplomatic spat between italy and germany deepened on wednesday when german chancellor schröder ’ s office announced the chancellor had dropped plans of taking a holiday in rimini in the province of emilia romagna in italy and would spend his vacation in his home town of hanover instead .
" chancellor gerhard schröder does not want to put his family through further speculation about the little vacation time they have together , " government spokesman bela anda said in a statement .

24 september 2002 " there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa .
iraq has no active civilian nuclear power programme or nuclear power plants and therefore has no legitimate reason to acquire uranium . "
iraq 's weapons of mass destruction : the assessment of the british government 28 january 2003 " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
us president george w bush 's state of the union address 7 march 2003 " based on thorough analysis , the iaea has concluded , with the concurrence of outside experts , that these documents - which formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions between iraq and niger - are in fact not authentic .

sir bob scott , 59 , is paying an informal visit to the event but it has led to speculation that the eisteddfod could stage some parts of the competition outside wales for the first time in its 56-year history .
many people living in north east wales were more supportive of liverpool 's bid for culture city status than they were for cardiff 's .
the links between the two regions could be further cemented if an idea to team up the 2008 international eisteddfod with the merseyside city comes to fruition .
fighter : sir bob worked on liverpool 's culture bid despite having a heart attack liverpool beat off competition from newcastle-gateshead , bristol , birmingham , oxford and cardiff to land the coveted european capital of culture title - worth millions of pounds in tourism and arts revenue .
international eisteddfod bosses are to discuss the possibility of forging close links with the city in five years ' time .
the meeting with sir bob , chairman of liverpool 's successful city of culture bid , will talk about teaming up in 2008 when the city becomes european capital of culture .
he previously headed manchester 's successful commonwealth games bid and its failed olympic bid before coming to liverpool .
a deal with him could see eisteddfod events being staged outside wales for the first time ever , as well as leading liverpudlian 's performing in llangollen .
liverpool has already said it wants to host the national eisteddfod as part of its year as european capital of culture .
llangollen : bidding for share in liverpool 's culture win ?
but the move is not expected to go ahead - cardiff council has already been awarded the 2008 event , and an eisteddfod chief said it would be " unlikely " .
cardiff 's failure to be named european capital of culture was blamed on its failure to embrace the valleys sufficiently as part of its bid .
the llangollen eisteddfod is a major event in the music calendar , attracting 80,000 visitors each year .

in a sweeping scheme to overhaul pay policy for its 50,000 staff , the company said it would be moving towards directly granting employees packages of shares as a performance incentive .
share options allow recipients to buy company stock at preferential prices at some future date , and therefore aim to tie compensation more closely to company performance .
during the 1990s , many firms , especially cash-poor but promising hi-tech and internet ventures , granted employees generous blocks of options - often in lieu of pay .
the appetite for these has faded as share prices have fallen , and many investors have become suspicious of the practice , since share option grants are not listed on a firm 's balance sheet and are therefore effectively free .
paying the price it is this last point , the way options are accounted for , that has persuaded microsoft to shift its policy .
granting workers shares , rather than share options , is recorded on balance sheets , and therefore gives analysts a clearer view of the company 's financial position .
the firm also argued that shares were a better incentive than options , since they are always worth something ; options , by contrast , can quickly become worthless if the company 's share price falls more than expected .

in a sweeping scheme to overhaul pay policy for its 50,000 staff , the company said it would be moving towards directly granting employees packages of shares as a performance incentive .
share options allow recipients to buy company stock at preferential prices at some future date , and therefore aim to tie compensation more closely to company performance .
during the 1990s , many firms , especially cash-poor but promising hi-tech and internet ventures , granted employees generous blocks of options - often in lieu of pay .
the appetite for these has faded as share prices have fallen , and many investors have become suspicious of the practice , since share option grants are not listed on a firm 's balance sheet and are therefore effectively free .
paying the price it is this last point , the way options are accounted for , that has persuaded microsoft to shift its policy .
granting workers shares , rather than share options , is recorded on balance sheets , and therefore gives analysts a clearer view of the company 's financial position .
the firm also argued that shares were a better incentive than options , since they are always worth something ; options , by contrast , can quickly become worthless if the company 's share price falls more than expected .
there has long been disagreement among companies and pay consultants over which form of compensation works best .
almost all agree that tying pay to company performance in some way is crucial , but there are concerns that a focus on short-term share-price movements might detract from the long-term interests of the company .

doubts about a claim that iraq had tried to buy uranium from the african state of niger were aired 10 months before mr bush included the allegation in his key state of the union address this year , a cia official has told the bbc .
on tuesday , the white house for the first time officially acknowledged that the niger claim was wrong and suggested it should not have been used in the president 's state of the union speech in january .
given the fact that the report on the yellow cake did not turn out to be accurate , that is reflective of the president 's broader statement white house spokesman ari fleischer uranium row in quotes but the cia official has said that a former us diplomat had already established the claim was false in march 2002 - and that the information had been passed on to government departments , including the white house , well before mr bush mentioned it in the speech .
both president bush and uk prime minister tony blair mentioned the claim , based on british intelligence , that iraq was trying to get uranium from niger as part of its attempt to build a nuclear weapons programme .
mr blair is under fire from british mps about the credibility of a dossier of evidence , which set out his case for war .
and in the us , increasing doubts are being raised about the american use of intelligence .
forged documents in his keynote speech to congress in january , the president said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
but the documents alleging a transaction were found to have been forged .
white house spokesman ari fleischer appeared to concede on tuesday that the uranium claim in the state of the union address was based on inaccurate information .
" the president 's statement was based on the predicate of the yellow cake -lsb- uranium -rsb- from niger , " mr fleischer said .
" so given the fact that the report on the yellow cake did not turn out to be accurate , that is reflective of the president 's broader statement . "
the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa .
president george w bush mr bush 's state of the union address but a former us diplomat , ambassador joseph wilson , went on the record at the weekend to say that he had travelled to africa to investigate the uranium claims and found no evidence to support them .
now the cia official has told the bbc that mr wilson 's findings had been passed onto the white house as early as march 2002 .
that means that the administration would have known nearly a year before the state of the union address that the information was likely false .
in response , a us government official told the bbc that the white house received hundreds of intelligence reports every day .
the official said there was no evidence that this specific cable about uranium had been passed on to the president .
but in congress , democrats are demanding a full investigation into the intelligence that underpinned the case for war .
they have demanded to know if president bush used evidence that he knew to be weak or wrong .
british undeterred the british government has stood by its assertion , saying the forged documents were not the only evidence used to reach its conclusion that saddam hussein tried to buy uranium from africa .
on tuesday mr blair defended the assessment , telling a committee of mps that it was not a " fantasy " and that the intelligence services themselves stood by the allegation .
" the evidence that we had that the iraqi government had gone back to try to purchase further amounts of uranium from niger did not come from these so-called ' forged ' documents , they came from separate intelligence , " mr blair said .
however , mr blair did not specify what that separate intelligence was .
