the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.01.2003 eu to approve sweeping farming reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission wants to make farming in member countries more efficient .
the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .
the discussions are likely to go on for several months yet as members try to reconcile deep-seated differences between those vehemently opposed to the scale of reform envisaged by fischler , and those keen to agree on sweeping changes before ten new member states join the bloc next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .
the discussions are likely to go on for several months yet as members try to reconcile deep-seated differences between those vehemently opposed to the scale of reform envisaged by fischler , and those keen to agree on sweeping changes before ten new member states join the bloc next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .
german politicians , who generally support the reforms , fear eastern german farmers will be hard hit by them .

thousands of jobs are at stake in a region grappling with staggering unemployment .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "

the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .
in seeking a more defined , and legally binding position on the debate , politicians will most likely heed the reaction to their decision and also take into account another committee ’ s conclusion in 2002 that emphatically opposes pid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host international cloning ban conference as the global debate over human cloning takes on new urgency , germany said on friday it will host an international conference in may with the goal of putting fresh momentum behind a global ban .

france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace . following the start of a series of gala events and the unveiling of a major joint declaration , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac sat down to lunch on wednesday , sipping white wine from germany and red from france . the spirit of french-german ties was felt in both countries on jan .
22 , as a series of gala celebrations and a row of special joint events kicked off in versailles , france , to mark the anniversary of the elysée treaty , which reconciled the two former enemies and saw the start of a new era of post-war reconciliation 40 years ago . joint political declaration the celebrations began with the unveiling of a major joint political initiative , announcing a " new stage " in the cooperation between the two countries .
in the declaration , which was revealed following a joint french-german cabinet session , the two countries pledged further bilateral military cooperation , the development of common policies in the european union , and the promotion of " respect for linguistic pluralism in the union 's institutions , " including measures to favor french and german . in addition , the two countries announced the further harmonization of laws and plans to hold regular joint cabinet meetings on issues of common interest . speaking on wednesday , schröder emphasized the importance of franco-german cooperation , which is he described as being based on " common values and common goals . "
referring indirectly to the issue of a possible u.s.-led military attack on iraq , he said the close cooperation between the two countries , in particular on an international level , was more important than ever " in these difficult times .

more than 1,000 members of parliament - including 577 from france and 603 from germany - took part in a row of top-level meetings and exuberant banquets held at the highly symbolic venue . it was here that the germans , after winning the franco-prussian war , humiliated the french by crowing wilhelm i as kaiser of their united countries in the legendary hall of mirrors at versailles .
and it was in the same room that france lined up with its world war i allies , forcing the defeated germans to sign the punitive treaty of versailles . it was also at this historically charged venue that chirac on wednesday pledged to " take the next step down the historic path laid by chancellor -lrb- konrad -rrb- adenauer and gen. charles de gaulle . " speaking at the joint press conference , schröder described versailles as the right place to celebrate the historic event and to follow on with what was laid out in the treaty 40 years ago . " it is exactly the right place and the right time to fill this treaty with new life and the european perspective , which is now needed . "

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .

france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace . following the start of a series of gala events and the unveiling of a major joint declaration , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac sat down to lunch on wednesday , sipping white wine from germany and red from france . the spirit of french-german ties was felt in both countries on jan .
22 , as a series of gala celebrations and a row of special joint events kicked off in versailles , france , to mark the anniversary of the elysée treaty , which reconciled the two former enemies and saw the start of a new era of post-war reconciliation 40 years ago . joint political declaration the celebrations began with the unveiling of a major joint political initiative , announcing a " new stage " in the cooperation between the two countries .
in the declaration , which was revealed following a joint french-german cabinet session , the two countries pledged further bilateral military cooperation , the development of common policies in the european union , and the promotion of " respect for linguistic pluralism in the union 's institutions , " including measures to favor french and german . in addition , the two countries announced the further harmonization of laws and plans to hold regular joint cabinet meetings on issues of common interest . speaking on wednesday , schröder emphasized the importance of franco-german cooperation , which is he described as being based on " common values and common goals . "
referring indirectly to the issue of a possible u.s.-led military attack on iraq , he said the close cooperation between the two countries , in particular on an international level , was more important than ever " in these difficult times . " he said previous talks , held at a joint cabinet session earlier on wednesday , had shown that both countries had similar ideas on the future of europe , and that the strength of franco-german relations " would be a boost to eu expansion . " first joint parliamentary session wednesday 's celebrations reached their zenith with a historic joint parliamentary session at versailles .
more than 1,000 members of parliament - including 577 from france and 603 from germany - took part in a row of top-level meetings and exuberant banquets held at the highly symbolic venue . it was here that the germans , after winning the franco-prussian war , humiliated the french by crowing wilhelm i as kaiser of their united countries in the legendary hall of mirrors at versailles .
and it was in the same room that france lined up with its world war i allies , forcing the defeated germans to sign the punitive treaty of versailles . it was also at this historically charged venue that chirac on wednesday pledged to " take the next step down the historic path laid by chancellor -lrb- konrad -rrb- adenauer and gen. charles de gaulle . " speaking at the joint press conference , schröder described versailles as the right place to celebrate the historic event and to follow on with what was laid out in the treaty 40 years ago . " it is exactly the right place and the right time to fill this treaty with new life and the european perspective , which is now needed . "

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .
in seeking a more defined , and legally binding position on the debate , politicians will most likely heed the reaction to their decision and also take into account another committee ’ s conclusion in 2002 that emphatically opposes pid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host international cloning ban conference as the global debate over human cloning takes on new urgency , germany said on friday it will host an international conference in may with the goal of putting fresh momentum behind a global ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.01.2003 eu to approve sweeping farming reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission wants to make farming in member countries more efficient .
the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .
the discussions are likely to go on for several months yet as members try to reconcile deep-seated differences between those vehemently opposed to the scale of reform envisaged by fischler , and those keen to agree on sweeping changes before ten new member states join the bloc next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .
in seeking a more defined , and legally binding position on the debate , politicians will most likely heed the reaction to their decision and also take into account another committee ’ s conclusion in 2002 that emphatically opposes pid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host international cloning ban conference as the global debate over human cloning takes on new urgency , germany said on friday it will host an international conference in may with the goal of putting fresh momentum behind a global ban .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .
the discussions are likely to go on for several months yet as members try to reconcile deep-seated differences between those vehemently opposed to the scale of reform envisaged by fischler , and those keen to agree on sweeping changes before ten new member states join the bloc next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .

more than 1,000 members of parliament - including 577 from france and 603 from germany - took part in a row of top-level meetings and exuberant banquets held at the highly symbolic venue . it was here that the germans , after winning the franco-prussian war , humiliated the french by crowing wilhelm i as kaiser of their united countries in the legendary hall of mirrors at versailles .
and it was in the same room that france lined up with its world war i allies , forcing the defeated germans to sign the punitive treaty of versailles . it was also at this historically charged venue that chirac on wednesday pledged to " take the next step down the historic path laid by chancellor -lrb- konrad -rrb- adenauer and gen. charles de gaulle . " speaking at the joint press conference , schröder described versailles as the right place to celebrate the historic event and to follow on with what was laid out in the treaty 40 years ago . " it is exactly the right place and the right time to fill this treaty with new life and the european perspective , which is now needed . "

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "

the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .
the discussions are likely to go on for several months yet as members try to reconcile deep-seated differences between those vehemently opposed to the scale of reform envisaged by fischler , and those keen to agree on sweeping changes before ten new member states join the bloc next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to propose sweeping farming reforms the eu is set to release a plan for the massive restructuring of its direct payment subsidies to farmers .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .

france and germany celebrate 40 years of post-war reconciliation with the unveiling of a major joint political declaration and a historic joint session of the two countries ' parliaments at france 's versailles palace . following the start of a series of gala events and the unveiling of a major joint declaration , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac sat down to lunch on wednesday , sipping white wine from germany and red from france . the spirit of french-german ties was felt in both countries on jan .
22 , as a series of gala celebrations and a row of special joint events kicked off in versailles , france , to mark the anniversary of the elysée treaty , which reconciled the two former enemies and saw the start of a new era of post-war reconciliation 40 years ago . joint political declaration the celebrations began with the unveiling of a major joint political initiative , announcing a " new stage " in the cooperation between the two countries .
in the declaration , which was revealed following a joint french-german cabinet session , the two countries pledged further bilateral military cooperation , the development of common policies in the european union , and the promotion of " respect for linguistic pluralism in the union 's institutions , " including measures to favor french and german . in addition , the two countries announced the further harmonization of laws and plans to hold regular joint cabinet meetings on issues of common interest . speaking on wednesday , schröder emphasized the importance of franco-german cooperation , which is he described as being based on " common values and common goals .

" speaking at the joint press conference , schröder described versailles as the right place to celebrate the historic event and to follow on with what was laid out in the treaty 40 years ago .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .
in seeking a more defined , and legally binding position on the debate , politicians will most likely heed the reaction to their decision and also take into account another committee ’ s conclusion in 2002 that emphatically opposes pid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host international cloning ban conference as the global debate over human cloning takes on new urgency , germany said on friday it will host an international conference in may with the goal of putting fresh momentum behind a global ban .

the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .
with this measure , fischler hopes to correct the current inbalance that 80 percent of subsidies for agriculture are received by only 20 percent of europe 's farms .
reducing the butter mountains the cap is a source of significant criticism on the international stage .
harking the call of output equals subsidy , farmers have long been systematically over-producing , creating butter mountains and wine lakes , and sullying the name of european agriculture among developing nations. he main thrust of the agricultural overhaul is a long-term plan to reduce generous farm subsidies , which currently make up almost half of the 42 billion eu agriculture budget .
commissioner franz fiischler aims to save 20 percent of the eu 's current spending on agriculture , which will then be ploughed back into rural development .
resistance to the reforms although the european commission has backed the plans , farming associations were quick to reject them .
european farming president gerd sonnleitner warned that the cap reform could spell out the closure of many farms and a dramatic reduction in farming income , especially in germany .
in addition france , which is renowned for its strong agricultural lobbyists , is openly opposed to the new plans .
the eu commission , however , says its studies prove that the overhaul of the old system would actually mean increased income and stable income for farmers .
" our suggestions will give farmers a clear perspective for the future " , agricultural commissioner fischler said on wednesday .
" and they will no longer be forced to produce at a loss in order to receive support . "
the next round fischler is keen to press ahead with the reforms as soon as possible , but faces cold winds from all over the european continent .
the next round of negotiations are scheduled to start next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.01.2003 eu to approve sweeping farming reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission wants to make farming in member countries more efficient .
the european commission has approved a radical reform of europe 's much critized common agricultural policy that seeks to sever the link between farm subsidies and output . the european commission announced on wednesday it would approve a revised plan drawn up by european agriculture commissioner franz fischler to reform the eu ’ s common agriculture policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
the new proposals , which take the line of ‘ quality not quantity ’ are aimed at breaking the traditional link between subsidy and output .
grants will no longer be attached to production levels , but will be conditional on a number of statutory environmental , animal welfare and food safety standards as well as occupational safety requirements for farmers .
under the revised plan , there will no longer be an originally proposed 300,000 euro -lrb- $ 298,000 -rrb- limit on direct payments to farms with more than 1,000 hectares -lrb- 2,500 acres -rrb- .
in the original cap reform blueprint issued in july of last year , fischler outlined harsh plans to impose a maximum subsidy cap of 300,000 euros on large farms .
his proposals were met coldly by germany , which feared for its high proportion of large-scale farms , particularly those in the former east .
the proposal would have had a disproportionate impact on eastern german states where , due to agricultural structures in the former communist regime , farms are on average seven times larger than those in other western states .
fischler has since reviewed the figure , which will now be fixed at a higher , as yet undetermined rate .
support of small farms the hardest hit under the terms of the new framework will be farms which presently receive more than 50,000 euros .
subsidies to these farms are due to be cut by 19 percent by the year 2013 .
farmers who currently receive grants of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros will see their subsidies honed down by 12.5 percent in the same period .
small farms , which receive less than 5,000 euros under the existing cap will be exempted in grant cuts .

government-appointed council says couples concerned about potential life-threatening diseases in their offspring , should be allowed to pre-test their artifically-inseminated embryos . in a decision that has riled german associations for the handicapped and religious groups , the country 's national ethics council issued a recommendation on thursday to permit the restricted testing of artificially inseminated embryos before they are implanted in a woman ’ s body .
the opinion by the national ethics council says couples who have reason to believe their child could suffer from life-threatening genetic or chromosomal defects have a right to decide whether or not to abort the child .
at the same time , the council made sure to narrowly define who had the right to choose that sort of testing , called pid .
the hope is that the debate will now enter the public realm before politicians bring it before german parliament .
pre-testing " justifiable , " says government the decision , supported by 15 of the 24 council members , was readily accepted by chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democratic-green coalition government .
the ministers of health , research and social issues welcomed the decision in a join statement praising the strict conditions outlined by the ethics council .
" with consideration for the affected women , we feel the possibility of a pid under strict conditions and limitations is justifiable , " read the statement .
only couples who are faced with the risk that serious and life-threatening hereditary diseases could be passed on to their children are allowed to pre-test .
also , couples who could pass on a serious chromosomal defect onto their offspring that could threaten the child ’ s life after the birth are allowed to pre-screen .
slippery slope to pre-selection ?
opponents fear such strict requirements might later be loosened , possibly leading to the type of pre-selection that invokes hitler ’ s dream of a master race .
critics also say the pre-implant testing also violates the rights of the child , which the german constitution says begins when sperm meets egg .
" humans will be killed , that needs to be said clearly , " said wolfgang wodarg , a health expert with schröder ’ s social democratic party and an opponent of pid .
the central committee of german catholics , in a statement , said it " regretted " the decision .
associations advocating for the handicapped said pre-implant testing on a case-by-case basis was impossible .
" a little bit of pid is as impossible as a little bit pregnant , " said robert antretter , head of a national aid organization for people with mental handicaps .
in the end , the council ’ s opinion is just that .

the floodlit sculpture , entitled b of the bang , will feature 200 tapered columns shooting from its centre and has been compared to a fireworks explosion .
a model of the sculpture will be unveiled at the city 's town hall on thursday , after a planning meeting in which councillors will discuss the proposals .
the plans have been put forward by designer tom heatherwick to mark the success of the games .
the artwork features 180 steel spikes and is aimed at capturing the power of athletics and the crack of the starting pistol .
a spokeswoman for new east manchester , the regeneration project which commissioned the sculpture , said it was chosen by a team of judges which included local residents .
she added : " we hope this sculpture will become a landmark on the city 's skyline just as the city of manchester stadium has become . "
if councillors grant planning permission , the artwork is due to be completed in july .
manchester city football club moves to the stadium - built for the commonwealth games - at the start of next season .
b of the bang , funded by the north west development agency and the european regional development fund , will stand on the corner of alan turing way and ashton new road .

mark dampier , technical director of hargreaves lansdown , one of the uk 's largest ifas , told bbc news online that investors were too battered and bruised by three years of falling share prices to invest this year .
investors are sick of losing money hand over fist mark dampier in addition , private investors and even some city professionals are waiting for a conclusion to the iraq crisis before ploughing money into the market .
the warning coincides with a report from a leading city firm which shows that many of the best performing stock market funds from the five years to 1997 have been some of the worst performers over the past five years .
sitting on losses mr dampier said that 2003 was likely to see the lowest volume of investment from private investors in the stock market since 1988 .
" put simply , investors are sick of losing money hand over fist , even if they had invested in a better than average performing investment fund three years ago they would still be sitting on a 40-50 % loss now . "
mr dampier believes that the collapse of investor confidence could have grave consequences for the city of london , which has endured massive job cuts in recent times .
" investment houses are finding it nearly impossible to attract any money at all . "
what is more , a new report from close wealth management highlights the extent to which once high performing funds - which attracted huge private investor interest - have fallen off their perch in recent times .
fall from grace according to research of the top performing stock market funds over the period 1992 to 1997 , only three remained in this group in the following five year period .
in fact , many funds fell to near the bottom of the performance league table .
the biggest fall from grace was suffered by the old mutual european fund which was ranked first in the five years to 1997 only to drop to 1,174 subsequently .
mr dampier said the report 's findings were no surprise .
" two main factors are at work : the management that got the fund to its lofty position may have been poached or perhaps hot money from private investors flowed in ballooning the fund and making it too unwieldy to move in and out of stocks quickly . "
how far will they fall ?

" investment houses are finding it nearly impossible to attract any money at all . "
what is more , a new report from close wealth management highlights the extent to which once high performing funds - which attracted huge private investor interest - have fallen off their perch in recent times .
fall from grace according to research of the top performing stock market funds over the period 1992 to 1997 , only three remained in this group in the following five year period .
in fact , many funds fell to near the bottom of the performance league table .
the biggest fall from grace was suffered by the old mutual european fund which was ranked first in the five years to 1997 only to drop to 1,174 subsequently .
mr dampier said the report 's findings were no surprise .
" two main factors are at work : the management that got the fund to its lofty position may have been poached or perhaps hot money from private investors flowed in ballooning the fund and making it too unwieldy to move in and out of stocks quickly . "

the bbc 's jonny dymond in istanbul says some of the countries want a declaration to include criticism of us aggression , as well as a strongly worded demand that saddam hussein comply with united nations resolutions .

they have started to make a major difference and that will change things bristol city council spokesman but a spokesman for the local education authority said new head , stephen murtagh , had cracked down on missing pupils .
new monitoring systems were in place to check on the whereabouts of missing pupils and officials visited parents when their children failed to attend , he said .
the council was prepared to take parents of persistant truants to court and had either done so or was preparing to in several cases , he added .
the result was attendance had improved since the start of the new school year , he said .
" we are conscious that the school was n't really delivering on that aspect .
" they have started to make a major difference and that will change things . "
a recent inspection by education watchdog ofsted showed teaching standards were good overall and most children were learning " satisfactorily " .
