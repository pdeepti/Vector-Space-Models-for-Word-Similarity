the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai .
president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .
karzai ’ s government has little control in most of the 32 provinces , where governors often rule like warlords with private militias . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .
-lrb- august 30 , 2003 -rrb- schröder backs sending troops to kunduz german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .
" lufthansa will now have to try to find another u.s. partner to cooperate with . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france-klm merger anticipated european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry .

klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .

a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .

a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .

he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .

in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , schäuble , who has been confined to a wheelchair since a knife attack in 1990 , would not directly say he was going to run , but would not rule it out when asked .
he said a discussion over a possible candidacy had not yet taken place among the cdu leadership .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .
" lufthansa will now have to try to find another u.s. partner to cooperate with . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france-klm merger anticipated european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .

germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .

but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .

the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .

a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's complete dossier of coverage of the european convention and the road towards approving the eu 's first-ever constitution .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai .
president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .
karzai ’ s government has little control in most of the 32 provinces , where governors often rule like warlords with private militias . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .
-lrb- august 30 , 2003 -rrb- schröder backs sending troops to kunduz german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .

here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .

their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.09.2003 michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a pose michael schumacher has become accustomed to .
he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .

it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .
" lufthansa will now have to try to find another u.s. partner to cooperate with . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france-klm merger anticipated european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.09.2003 michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a pose michael schumacher has become accustomed to .
he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai .
president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.09.2003 michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a pose michael schumacher has become accustomed to .
he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's complete dossier of coverage of the european convention and the road towards approving the eu 's first-ever constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.09.2003 michael schumacher - from go-carts to grand prix großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a pose michael schumacher has become accustomed to .
he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .

however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .

gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .

a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's complete dossier of coverage of the european convention and the road towards approving the eu 's first-ever constitution .

the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's complete dossier of coverage of the european convention and the road towards approving the eu 's first-ever constitution .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .
worries unfounded say analysts " some people may be worried that the likes of lufthansa , iberia and british airways may get left behind but these worries are overdone , " one analyst told the financial times deutschland .
" the merger benefits from the klm and air france deal , like capacity and headcount numbers , are not going to start to come through for quite a while and when they do , it will be good for the industry , ” he said .
others are not yet convinced that the proposed merger will get off the ground .
gert-jan geels , an asset manager at eureffect bv in amsterdam told bloomberg.com : “ i have doubts whether the merger will work .
there are more failed mergers than successful ones , and in the airline industry i do n't even know of a deal like this at all . ”
lufthansa remains unconcerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facing competition .
lufthansa said the company was not surprised by the move and did not fear the competition of a combined airline that would be the world 's largest in terms of turnover .
" this concentration is a process which had been on the cards for several years , " lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said .
the european airline market will now be dominated by the big three of lufthansa , british airways and the new air france-klm , he said .
" we will remain with our star alliance the number one among the alliances , " jachnow added .
but the news that the deal was progressing hit lufthansa shares on the frankfurt stock exchange .
lufthansa shares fell 1.3 percent to € 11.57 as investors showed their concern that the new air france-klm would eat into the german company ’ s market share .
british airways shares rose 1.9 percent to 171.75 pence .
wake-up call for european carriers financial watchers consider the deal a wake-up call to the european market which will have to accommodate the new and powerful industry force .
" if it really ends in a merger , then lufthansa is left empty-handed .
it will produce a strong competitor , " said one frankfurt-based trader .
" lufthansa will now have to try to find another u.s. partner to cooperate with . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france-klm merger anticipated european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .

in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , schäuble , who has been confined to a wheelchair since a knife attack in 1990 , would not directly say he was going to run , but would not rule it out when asked .
he said a discussion over a possible candidacy had not yet taken place among the cdu leadership .
however , he told interviewers he was " as healthy as any 61-year-old can be " and that " there are n't that many prejudices left in this country against people in wheelchairs . "
the former interior minister and party chairman is considered a favorite of the union parties for the post .
johannes rau , who has been federal president since 1999 , has announced he will not run again for the office .
a new president will be chosen in may 2004 by a special federal body in which the union parties along with the free democrats hold a majority . more briefs 30.09.2003 -pipe- union parties enjoying strong voter support 30.09.2003 -pipe- every fourth german is over sixty 30.09.2003 -pipe- rhine river level drops to historic low 30.09.2003 -pipe- berlin marathon saves addict 's life 30.09.2003 -pipe- toll company should bear cost of delays 30.09.2003 -pipe- tourist ship runs aground on rhine 29.09.2003 -pipe- schumacher one point away from record sixth title 25.09.2003 -pipe- cuba rejects visit by german politician 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .

president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .

a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .
germany 's lufthansa remains cool about the effects of the deal on its business . air france ’ s effective takeover of klm , the dutch flag carrier , has reached the preliminary agreement stage according to statements released by both companies on tuesday .
if the deal goes through to completion it will create europe 's biggest airline , the world 's largest by turnover and will be a move unprecedented in the history of the european air industry .
if the merger goes ahead , the new air france-klm will have a combined turnover of € 19.2 billion -lrb- $ 22.4 billion -rrb- and a workforce of around 106,000 .
the two airlines said the deal was expected to generate synergies that would result in an improvement in operating profits of between € 385 million -lrb- $ 449 million -rrb- and € 495 million -lrb- $ 577 million -rrb- after five years .
the new partnership will serve 226 destinations worldwide , operating a fleet of 540 aircraft within a international network centred on the airlines ’ two main hubs of paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam schiphol airports .
skyteam turns up the heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star alliance tail fins .
the impact of the deal will not stop there .
once klm joins the french giant , it will become part of the skyteam global airline alliance led by air france and u.s. carrier delta air lines .
klm ’ s inclusion in the alliance will assist in skyteam ’ s growing bid to rival and usurp its competitors star , led by germany 's lufthansa and united airlines of the u.s. , and oneworld led by british airways and american airlines .
the dutch carrier will bring its own network of partners closer to the skyteam fold .
klm ’ s close transatlantic alliance with u.s.-based northwest airlines is likely to continue as northwest and continental airlines are expected to stick with their european partner .
ties with skyteam are already strong through the domestic marketing alliance both northwest and continental already have with delta air lines .
alitalia could strengthen the alliance grip if that wasn ’ t enough to worry the big guns in the air industry , air france announced that in " the medium term , " the new group could be expanded further by the " potential integration " of alitalia , the majority state-owned italian airline .
such plans have aroused the interest of the european commission which is already scrutinizing the air france-klm proceedings for breaches of competition law , while rival british airways has urged investigators to closely examine the terms of the tie-up .
" we are urging the competition regulators to look very closely at the proposals and be especially vigilant to make sure the deal does n't reduce competition across north atlantic routes , " said cathy west , a spokeswoman for british airways in a statement to the press .
in the face of such a potentially powerful partnership , rival european carriers are watching closely .
however , according to analysts , airlines such as germany ’ s lufthansa and british airways have little , initially , to fear .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai .
president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .
karzai ’ s government has little control in most of the 32 provinces , where governors often rule like warlords with private militias . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .
-lrb- august 30 , 2003 -rrb- schröder backs sending troops to kunduz german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval .

in an interview with deutsche welle , he said security was still the country 's biggest problem .

the german proposal states that these islands of security would be composed of roughly 250 to 400 troops with mobile units to connect them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on patrol in kabul .
the german government , which along with its canadian counterpart provides the majority of the 5,000-strong isaf presence in afghanistan , has already agreed to expand its army ’ s peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , with a possible deployment of between 230 and 450 troops of the provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- to protect reconstruction projects in the northern city of kunduz . expansion subject to new u.n. mandate because of restrictions in the german constitution , the deployment requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before berlin can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .
the current u.n. mandate , which limits the mission to the afghan capital and surrounding areas , is expected to be renewed in december .
however , german chancellor gerhard schröder said last week that he expected the u.n. security council to agree on isaf deployment to the provinces “ in a very short time . ” the german proposal goes beyond deploying troops solely as protection to the ongoing civilian reconstruction work and includes a plan for isaf soldiers to be involved in providing security for nationwide elections expected to be held no later than june 10 , 2004 .
so far , a german diplomat said , germany has not encountered opposition to its proposal .
" we 've had positive words of welcome from several -lrb- countries -rrb- , including the u.s , " he told cnn germany . bundeswehr would get kunduz as planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next stop : kunduz ?
a german official said strategically important cities and locations such as mazar-e sharif , kandahar and herat would be the main focus of the extended deployment in a bid to protect the humanitarian and reconstruction work needed to bring stability to the areas .
the official added that germany would go ahead with its plan to send bundeswehr troops to kunduz to create “ a refuge of security . ” plueger , who is expected to tour afghanistan with members of the u.n. security council in late october , said discussions are ongoing with nato and a resolution on extending isaf ’ s range should be ready to present to the security council in october . karzai warns of growing opposition the german proposal increases the urgency surrounding the discussion to expand the isaf mandate at a time when increasing lawlessness in the country is causing many afghans to hope for the return of security that marked the rule of the rigid taliban regime .
the afghan president hamid karzai issued a warning last week saying that if international reconstruction aid falters and no more troops are deployed , islamic radicals could regain control in afghanistan . his feelings have been echoed in recent weeks by the united nations and several aid agencies which have urged repeatedly for the kabul-confined force to be expanded to the provinces , warning that aid , development and reconstruction were being hampered by violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai .
president karzai reiterated his call for more peacekeepers to be deployed in areas which have seen increased attacks in recent weeks when he met with nato secretary-general lord robertson on sunday .
instability in rural areas is causing concern in kabul that taliban sympathizers are regrouping and growing in strength .

he 's the undisputed hero of formula one racing and just a step away from a sixth world championship .
but despite life in a very fast lane , michael schumacher has managed to keep things from spinning out of control . michael schumacher got behind the wheel early on in life .
at the age of four his father gave him a pedal go-cart and set him loose .
a collision between young michael 's cart and a local lamppost might have put an end to the racing story , but his dad decided to send him to a local go-cart track where lampposts were n't a problem .
it was a fortuitous decision and the beginning of one of the most dazzling careers ever in formula one racing . born in 1969 in the village of hürth-hermühlheim in germany 's rhineland region , his father 's interest in go-carting - he later managed a local track - provided the spark to his career .
soon after his father sent him to the course , schumacher 's natural talent for racing began to show . although he considered it just a hobby , he starting winning races and earning a name for himself on the carting circuit .
in 1984 he became german junior champion and one year later he finished runner-up in the junior world championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 schumacher graduated from go-carts ; in 1992 he won his first major car racing championship .
three years later , he became the youngest double formula one world champion by winning the 1994 and 1995 seasons .
he took home the top trophies again in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . after a victory on sunday in indianapolis , schumacher is one point shy of a record-breaking sixth world championship title .
he will race again in suzuka , japan on october 12 , and most racing watchers expect michael schumacher to enter the record books on that day . lucrative career choice life behind the wheel of a formula one race car , almost more jet airplane than car , has been good to schumacher , who was estimated by forbes magazine to be the highest paid athlete in the world .
he 's come a long way from the days when his father had to find a sponsor to support his go-cart racing . today , racing around a track at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour for the ferrari racing team and the lucrative product endorsements earn schumacher in the neighborhood of € 70 million -lrb- $ 80 million -rrb- a year .
he 's well on his way to career earnings of € 1 billion . but driving for formula one is quite different than speeding down a german autobahn , and while schumacher has a seemingly in-born talent for knowing how fast he can take curves safely , he is renowned for his discipline and leadership . he exercises four hours a day , largely to strengthen his neck muscles , which have to endure enormous g-forces in every race .
after the gym , it 's back to the track for hours of driving so he will be in top form for the two critical racing hours , usually held on sunday afternoons . it 's the thrill of the speed that keeps him in racing , he says .
the danger - and it can be extreme - does n't have any special appeal , especially since schumacher is married and has two young children . " none of us want to die , " he said in an interview .
" we do n't do it for the thrill of the danger .
we do it for the thrill of speed . "
he said there are some risks he refuses to take . positive role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's victory in the u.s. -lrb- photo -rrb- was schumacher 's 70th race win , and his career statistics are a source of awe to every motor sports enthusiast .
his average finish in 172 grand prix starts has been between second and third and he 's been a perennial on the winner 's platform for the past 11 years . every future driver , from the child getting a taste for go-cart racing to the young formula one hopefuls -lrb- and probably a lot of daredevil men and women on freeways around the world -rrb- , wants to emulate schumacher . while no one doubts his record on the track , his off-track activities are also the stuff of positive role models .
schumacher has avoided , publicly at least , the pitfalls that have befallen many other german sporting stars . family man schumacher sees loyalty as a virtue and views a casual fling as a character flaw , in striking contrast to soccer legend franz beckenbauer and former tennis star boris becker , whose dalliances with women and troubles with the tax authorities regularly make the pages of the tabloids . that 's not to say that schumacher has n't come in for some criticism .
as one the sporting world 's highest earners , germany 's favorite racing son has moved across the border to switzerland to save on his tax bill . but much of the criticism that has been levelled at him has to do with the rarefied culture and sporting practices of formula one as well as some of his questionable strategic tactics on the racetrack when the competition heats up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another complaint that has arisen seems hardly fair , but schumacher 's consistency on the track , his strictly business attitude about racing and overall nice-guy demeanor can can translate in our media-driven age into a kind of blandness .
beckenbauer and boris may be flawed , but those flaws stir the public 's emotions .
the visual language of their own sports , beckenbauer 's ballet-style performances on the soccer field and becker 's dives on the wimbeldon center court , were enough to inspire legions of fans . watching a formula one race , the most fans see of schumacher is his helmet , a car streaking down the straightaway in a straight line , maybe a daring passing maneuver or two .
what one does n't see is the shaking in the driver 's seat that is so intense that the driver ca n't read the pit board , the incremental adjustments of the steering wheel that can mean the difference between victory and catastrophe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumacher pays tribute to mother with victory michael and ralf schumacher took to the imola track in san marino on sunday in honor of their mother , elisabeth , who had died just hours before .

with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers to be centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the greatest reform in the history of the european union .
here 's a dw-world dummy 's guide . with the draft european constitution , the european union would , for the first time in its history , have a basic set of laws to replace an ever complicated tangle of treaties cobbled together during its nearly 50 years of existence .
a group of 105 delegates spent 16 months drafting the constitution at the european convention in brussels before completing their work in june .
on oct .
4 , the draft will be taken up by delegates participating in an intergovernmental conference of eu member states in rome .
their task is to finalize the language of the constitution in time for a major eu summit in rome this december , where leaders hope to give the future constitution their stamp of approval .
dw-world has put together a quick reader ’ s guide to the most important points in the draft constitution : foundations of the constitution the preamble calls on europeans to " transcend their ancient divisions and , united ever more closely , to forge a common destiny . "
it calls on the eu to draw its influence from europe ’ s " cultural , religious and humanist inheritance , " though it makes no direct reference to christianity .
it also bestows dual citizenship on all members - both european citizenship and national citizenship . it incorporates the charter of fundamental rights of the union , a bill of rights first approved at the dec .
2000 eu summit in nice , france , that guarantees free speech , freedom of religion , the right to life and other basic freedoms .
it also calls for sustainable development in europe that balances economic growth , a social market economy that is " highly competitive " and aimed at full employment and social progress while at the same time calling for a " high level of protection and improvement " of the environment .
competencies the constitution lays out a number of exclusive competencies for the european union - including trade issues and currency policy for euro zone members .
but it also includes areas of split competency , like environment and energy policy , where decisions made at the eu level can also affect member states ; but the majority of such legislation is made at the national level .
any competency not expressed in the constitution will remain at the national level .
eu institutions the european parliament , the european council , the council of ministers , the european commission and the european court of justice remain the central organs of the eu under the constitution .
but it also establishes a method of dual leadership : in addition to the president of the european commission , it also creates the position of a european council president .
the president would be elected by the council - the heads of state or government of the member states - for a 2.5 year term that can be extended by one additional term .
the president ’ s election would then have to be confirmed by the european parliament .
under the constitution , the president of the european commission would be elected by the european parliament .
the european commission would also be streamlined under the constitution .
until 2009 , each country would be able to send a commissioner to brussels , but after that , only 15 would have voting rights .
foreign policy the constitution also creates an office of the european union foreign minister .
the candidate would be selected by the european council , but would also be subject to confirmation by the european commission .
the foreign minister would also serve as vice president of the commission .
the constitution also calls for the union to take over competency in matters of common foreign and security policy - including all areas of foreign policy and all questions relating to the union ’ s security .
the " progressive framing of a common defense policy " could lead to a " common defense , " it stipulates . however , national vetos still apply to foreign policy decision-making .
majority voting one key provision of the constitution is that it eliminates current veto rights in broad policy areas and replaces them with qualified majority votes .
the constitution creates a contested new definition of qualified majority voting .
it would require that a majority of eu member states vote in favor of a law and that those votes represent 60 percent of the entire eu population .
however , the exact areas to which majority voting will apply will only be final after the intergovernmental conference completes its work .
currently , it appears the veto will still apply in areas of foreign , defense and taxation policy .
parliamentary power and petitions for referendum the constitution further strengthens the european parliament by providing it with a " co-decision with the council of ministers , " or vote , on most future laws important to the eu .
additionally , for the first time , the constitution requires the european commission to take up a political issue if at least one million european union citizens submit a petition .
it does not , however , require the commission to take a decision on the issue .
the right to sue in the future , parliaments of member states will be permitted to challenge eu decisions at the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the law would apply to all major national legislative bodies , including germany ’ s bundesrat , the upper legislative chamber that represents the interests of the country ’ s states at the national level .
exit clause for the first time , the constitution would also lay out the process by which a country could leave the european union .
european prosecutor in an effort to fight cross-border crime in the eu , the constitution also would create a european public prosecutor ’ s office to help reduce crime that transcends frontiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's complete dossier of coverage of the european convention and the road towards approving the eu 's first-ever constitution .

the nature conservation bill aims to look after sites of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- as well as giving all plants and creatures extra protection from activities like building development .
sssis already cover more than 12 % of scotland 's landscape and are designed to plants , animals , insects and even land formations .
the new law will stop landowners from being paid compensation for not carrying out developments on sssis , but will ensure that people who farm such areas are rewarded for maintaining it .
the measures were announced by environment minister ross finnie at a farm in kinross .
the bill also puts forward measures to clamp down on wildlife crime such as bird egg theft and animal snaring .
cautious welcome it has gone through consultation with bodies including scottish natural heritage , rspb scotland and wwf scotland .
mr finnie said : " the nature conservation bill is the product of extensive dialogue with environmental and land-owning and management interests .
" too often in the past environmental protection has involved conflict and prohibition .
the bill we are publishing today has its roots in co-operation and positive care for our special places .
" it is important that everyone plays their part in protecting the richness and diversity of the environment in which we live . "
green msp mark ruskell gave the bill a cautious welcome .
he said : " through this bill there could be significant opportunities to transfer subsidies away from agricultural over-production and towards enhancing scotland 's natural resources .
" but the funds need to be made available to do this .
without this funding it may just be business as usual . "
lloyd austin , spokesman for the royal society for the protection of birds , said the bill was a major step forward .
" we see this as one of the most significant pieces of environmental legislation in some time , " he said .
" we 'll now have a chance to take a closer look at the bill and carry on working with the scottish executive and the parliament to ensure that it brings about the greatest benefit possible . "

trustees of the £ 43m gardens site at llanarthne , carmarthenshire , west wales , want a further £ 300,000 to see them through the financial year or else face calling in the receivers .
the garden - opened in may 2000 by prince charles - has already had £ 1.4m of assembly cash this year to ease its costs and fund a marketing drive .
but this money runs out on tuesday and discussions last night for extra money broke up without a commitment from assembly ministers to ensure the site , considered an icon of modern wales , is not put into administration .
' no permanent subsidy ' mr morgan has said there can be no question of taxpayer 's cash being used to keep middleton 's doors open .
in a statement he said : " the garden 's finances were never based on a permanent assembly subsidy .
" it has always been an independent body run by independent trustees and would never have received millennium commission funding in the first place had it been a government project .
" it will be very disappointing for all concerned if the gardens have to close , and we have therefore been , and will continue , to work closely with the trustees in a final effort to find a strong partner to safeguard the garden . "
middleton trustees are expected to issue a statement on tuesday but last night a spokesman for middleton was adamant there was no prospect of the site closing its doors after little more than three years in operation .
chief executive evelyn selby said her major concern was the threat to 100 jobs at the garden and that the board would meet again on thursday after asking the assembly for further information about help .
visitor numbers fall carmarthenshire county council issued a statement saying it was " very disappointed that this national facility could be shut down " .
council leader meryl gravell said : " as a board we have done everything asked of us by the assembly to secure the future of the gardens . "
plaid cymru called on the assembly government to step in to help middleton .
middleton , then known at the national botanic garden of wales , attracted 225,000 people in its first year , but by march 2003 visitor numbers had fallen to 142,000 .
last spring it changed its name , calling itself simply middleton , with the assembly government picking up the tab for the publicity campaign .
research programme the cash followed on from £ 360,000 from the assembly last year .
last july , the site received a further £ 600,000 in a lottery grant .
but the cash injections have not helped it to achieve hopes that it would attract 250,000 visitors each year .
despite this , middleton has been heralded as a design and scientific success story .
it took three years to create and boasts the largest single span glasshouse in the world , designed by sir norman foster .
annual subsidy call the glasshouse features plants from the five mediterranean-climate areas of world .
in addition to its educational work , the site also has a respected research programme - last year scientists collected seed for plant which was thought to have been extinct in wales for 50 years .
in february 2001 , the institute of welsh affairs called for middleton to have an annual subsidy for its research work .
it claimed middleton 's equivalent in scotland has a subsidy of more than £ 5m .

the garden - opened in may 2000 by prince charles - has already had £ 1.4m of assembly cash this year to ease its costs and fund a marketing drive .
but this money runs out on tuesday and discussions last night for extra money broke up without a commitment from assembly ministers to ensure the site , considered an icon of modern wales , is not put into administration .
' no permanent subsidy ' mr morgan has said there can be no question of taxpayer 's cash being used to keep middleton 's doors open .
in a statement he said : " the garden 's finances were never based on a permanent assembly subsidy .
" it has always been an independent body run by independent trustees and would never have received millennium commission funding in the first place had it been a government project .
" it will be very disappointing for all concerned if the gardens have to close , and we have therefore been , and will continue , to work closely with the trustees in a final effort to find a strong partner to safeguard the garden . "
middleton trustees are expected to issue a statement on tuesday but last night a spokesman for middleton was adamant there was no prospect of the site closing its doors after little more than three years in operation .
chief executive evelyn selby said her major concern was the threat to 100 jobs at the garden and that the board would meet again on thursday after asking the assembly for further information about help .
visitor numbers fall carmarthenshire county council issued a statement saying it was " very disappointed that this national facility could be shut down " .
council leader meryl gravell said : " as a board we have done everything asked of us by the assembly to secure the future of the gardens . "
plaid cymru called on the assembly government to step in to help middleton .
middleton , then known at the national botanic garden of wales , attracted 225,000 people in its first year , but by march 2003 visitor numbers had fallen to 142,000 .
last spring it changed its name , calling itself simply middleton , with the assembly government picking up the tab for the publicity campaign .
research programme the cash followed on from £ 360,000 from the assembly last year .
last july , the site received a further £ 600,000 in a lottery grant .
but the cash injections have not helped it to achieve hopes that it would attract 250,000 visitors each year .
despite this , middleton has been heralded as a design and scientific success story .
it took three years to create and boasts the largest single span glasshouse in the world , designed by sir norman foster .
annual subsidy call the glasshouse features plants from the five mediterranean-climate areas of world .
in addition to its educational work , the site also has a respected research programme - last year scientists collected seed for plant which was thought to have been extinct in wales for 50 years .
in february 2001 , the institute of welsh affairs called for middleton to have an annual subsidy for its research work .
it claimed middleton 's equivalent in scotland has a subsidy of more than £ 5m .

welsh assembly officials and veterinary experts are working with their counterparts in the department for environment , food and rural affairs in the exercise recommended by a number of inquiries into the farming crisis .
the foot-and-mouth crisis cost the farming industry £ 3bn in disease control and saw more than six million animals destroyed - more than a million in wales - after it hit in 2001 .
critics of the way the outbreak was handled argue a more coordinated approach could have stemmed the spread of the virus , which cost more than £ 100m to eradicate from wales .
the welsh assembly government published its new-look contingency plan in april this year .
the exercise will test how officials respond to a foot-and-mouth scenario tuesday 's exercise will assess how communication and management systems work in an outbreak scenario .
carwyn jones , minister for environment , planning and countryside , said : " having effective contingency plans in place was a recommendation of several independent inquiries into foot-and-mouth , and it is also a requirement of the european union .

the bronze pan has the names of roman forts on it the bronze pan , dating from the second century ad , when the romans built the dividing wall across the north of england , was found in the staffordshire moorlands .
archaeologists are excited because the names of four forts located at the western end of hadrian 's wall - bowes , drumburgh , stanwix and castlesteads - are engraved on the vessel .
the discovery was being made public at the institute of archaeology in london by the portable antiquities scheme -lrb- pas -rrb- , an organisation which records archaeological objects found by members of the public .
until the discovery of this pan , only two other examples were known with inscriptions naming forts on hadrian 's wall - the rudge cup , discovered in wiltshire in 1725 , and the amiens patera , found in amiens in france in 1949 .
between them they name seven forts , but the present pan is the first to include drumburgh .
it also has the inscription of a person 's name on it .
the wall runs from the west of cumbria to wallsend sally worrell , roman expert for the pas , said the name , aelius draco , was " perhaps a veteran of a garrison of hadrian 's wall " , who had the vessel made on retirement .
she said : " this is an absolutely wonderful find - the most important roman object recorded with the portable antiquities scheme . "
elaborately decorated with celtic-style motifs , the vessel is inlaid with coloured enamel .
it is hoped the find will go on display at the british museum as part of a special exhibition opening in november , called buried treasure : finding our past .

the bronze pan has the names of roman forts on it the bronze pan , dating from the second century ad , when the romans built the dividing wall across the north of england , was found in the staffordshire moorlands .
archaeologists are excited because the names of four forts located at the western end of hadrian 's wall - bowes , drumburgh , stanwix and castlesteads - are engraved on the vessel .
the discovery was being made public at the institute of archaeology in london by the portable antiquities scheme -lrb- pas -rrb- , an organisation which records archaeological objects found by members of the public .
until the discovery of this pan , only two other examples were known with inscriptions naming forts on hadrian 's wall - the rudge cup , discovered in wiltshire in 1725 , and the amiens patera , found in amiens in france in 1949 .
between them they name seven forts , but the present pan is the first to include drumburgh .

the wall runs from the west of cumbria to wallsend sally worrell , roman expert for the pas , said the name , aelius draco , was " perhaps a veteran of a garrison of hadrian 's wall " , who had the vessel made on retirement .
she said : " this is an absolutely wonderful find - the most important roman object recorded with the portable antiquities scheme . "
elaborately decorated with celtic-style motifs , the vessel is inlaid with coloured enamel .
it is hoped the find will go on display at the british museum as part of a special exhibition opening in november , called buried treasure : finding our past .

twenty men escaped from lindholme removal centre , at lindholme prison near thorne , when they scaled a fence at on sunday night .
but 10 of them - four sri lankans and men from pakistan , cameroon , turkey , sierra leone , india and macedonia - were recaptured within a six mile radius of the isolated centre .
police said all 10 had been found thanks to the public who gave them information .
intelligence the prison service has launched an investigation into the escape .
more than 40 police officers , including dog teams , and a helicopter have been involved in attempts to recapture the remaining escapees , who police say pose no threat .
a spokeswoman for south yorkshire police said : " the advice to members of the public who encounter the asylum seekers is not to approach them and not to stop your car if flagged down by them , even though they are not considered dangerous .
" officers will be liaising with other forces and agencies and gathering intelligence on the missing men . "
superintendent dave featherstone said he was confident all the men would be recaptured as they would be easy to spot in the countryside .
he said : " looking at where they 've been found , they are n't getting very far and they will be in an area of 5-6 miles away .
" i would hope that if we get the continued co-operation of the public we will get all 20 back within the next couple of days . "
the missing men are from iraq , kosovo , ukraine , macedonia and india .

the chief inspector of prisons anne owers recently criticised lindholme in a report into asylum detention , saying it needed " fundamental and far-reaching changes " .
ms owers said detainees were not shown enough respect and were subjected to " unacceptable and unnecessary " random strip searches after visits .
she said asylum seekers interviewed by inspectors neither felt safe nor knew what was happening to them .
asylum seekers are held at lindholme under rules which allow immigration authorities to detain them at any stage of their process .
they can be detained without having been charged or convicted of a criminal offence .
campaigners say this criminalises vulnerable people and prevents them from having a fair hearing .

twenty men escaped from lindholme removal centre , at lindholme prison near thorne , when they scaled a fence at on sunday night .
but 10 of them - four sri lankans and men from pakistan , cameroon , turkey , sierra leone , india and macedonia - were recaptured within a six mile radius of the isolated centre .
police said all 10 had been found thanks to the public who gave them information .
intelligence the prison service has launched an investigation into the escape .
more than 40 police officers , including dog teams , and a helicopter have been involved in attempts to recapture the remaining escapees , who police say pose no threat .
a spokeswoman for south yorkshire police said : " the advice to members of the public who encounter the asylum seekers is not to approach them and not to stop your car if flagged down by them , even though they are not considered dangerous .
" officers will be liaising with other forces and agencies and gathering intelligence on the missing men . "
superintendent dave featherstone said he was confident all the men would be recaptured as they would be easy to spot in the countryside .
he said : " looking at where they 've been found , they are n't getting very far and they will be in an area of 5-6 miles away .
" i would hope that if we get the continued co-operation of the public we will get all 20 back within the next couple of days . "
the missing men are from iraq , kosovo , ukraine , macedonia and india .
they were all understood to be waiting for their asylum applications to be processed .
strip searches neither the police nor the home office would comment on reports circulating locally that the 20 escapees had scaled the 20ft high perimeter fence using a bed .
lindholme removal centre has 112 beds and was opened last year .
lindholme ' not safe ' most of those held there have had their asylum applications refused but a small number are people still going through the application procedure but considered likely to abscond .
the chief inspector of prisons anne owers recently criticised lindholme in a report into asylum detention , saying it needed " fundamental and far-reaching changes " .
ms owers said detainees were not shown enough respect and were subjected to " unacceptable and unnecessary " random strip searches after visits .
she said asylum seekers interviewed by inspectors neither felt safe nor knew what was happening to them .
asylum seekers are held at lindholme under rules which allow immigration authorities to detain them at any stage of their process .
they can be detained without having been charged or convicted of a criminal offence .
campaigners say this criminalises vulnerable people and prevents them from having a fair hearing .

david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london , offers help on property businesses and tax .
bbc news online will publish the next set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 7 , october .
question patrick bailey philpott , essex i am 13 years old and have formed my own business , sr & c limited .
i am considering starting my own marketing-oriented website in the near future but i do n't know where to start and , being 13 , i do n't know how to write a well-structured business plan .
i just do n't know what to do next and i really need some expert advice .
what shall i do ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop so what is your business ?
the title does n't give anything away .
well at this moment in time you are definitely going about it the wrong way .
you want to start a business but you do n't know what -lrb- why should you at your age ? -rrb- .
you think it might be market-oriented but only thinking .
i would really encourage you to spend the next couple of years shaping and defining the product or the service .
learn from everyone , ask questions , irritate by curiosity .
decide what your passion is and go from there .
forget business plans , or marketing plans or any other plans .
they mean diddly-squat .
the idea is king .
nothing else matters .
you can buy business plans off the shelf !
but you have to find out for yourself what and how your idea separates you from anyone else in the field you want to work in .
also -lrb- and this is a really good piece of advice -rrb- do n't think business , think livelihood !
question khalid muhmood , vietnam my wife and i have built a successful education and training business in vietnam which we would like to develop regionally .
i would appreciate your advice on what you feel was the most important factor in your success in expanding the body shop worldwide ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop having the product right and making sure everyone knew about it .
shout it from the rooftops .
communication of what the product is , is of primary importance .
if you want to expand , try franchising - by that i mean in its simplest definition you have the ownership of the product , you train others in your methods and they , the franchisee , invest in the overhead costs .
for me it was the only path to expansion as i had no money .
return to the top question neil darbar , england my wife runs a mobile catering business where we serve whole-day breakfasts in an industrial site and is doing very well .
though i say it myself , she is a brilliant cook and has several recipes of indian foods which are unheard of in the uk - and we all know how much the british public love indian foods .
we often cater at local events , specialising in indian foods and make a sauce which is so popular that we have been asked time and time again about the possibility of buying it in the shops .
could you please guide us on how to go about it as we think it would be an instant success if marketed correctly .
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer at cobra , we certainly know how much the british public loves indian food !
the short answer to your question is that it depends on what sort of production facilities you currently have .
if you can only produce enough sauce for small numbers of people then start off locally .
the best way would be to invest in some bespoke packaging , which could be as simple as sticky labels designed by yourselves -lrb- printed on your home computer -rrb- and stuck to plain containers .
if there is an interesting story behind the sauce , e.g. its history / origin , include it on the label .
then sell your sauce as an extra item on the mobile unit .
do some investigating and find some recipes that would complement your sauces .
print those on nicely designed paper and give them out with the pots .
do n't forget to try different styles of sauce too .
experiment on your regular customers and see if you can build up a small range of sauces .
when you try out new sauces , keep an eye on how that affects the sales of the original sauce - if you have two sauces but only the same sales , it might be more cost-effective just to stick with the one sauce .
try bringing in seasonal sauces -lrb- effectively limited editions , that could tie in with events in the calendar e.g. chinese new year -rrb- .
by constantly innovating you will keep the public 's interest and you 'll start to build up a reputation as sauce experts !
as soon as you are building up regular orders -lrb- even if it 's just one sauce -rrb- , take your success to the local newspapers and try to get them to write a feature on you .
you could offer a free delivery of the sauce to a number of their readers as an extra incentive to write an article .
armed with a great product , great sales and pr coverage , start targeting the local deli or takeaways in the area your mobile unit operates -lrb- to capitalise on the awareness you have created -rrb- .
provide the shops with the facilities to do tastings of the sauces i.e. ask them to put a tray of opened pots on the counter with bread sticks for customers try the product .
at this point , you might need to take your sauce and your story to your bank manger and invest in bigger production facilities and start expanding .
but make sure that you have the facilities to always meet demand - unreliable suppliers really annoy retailers .
as you grow , invest in the brand too , by improving the packaging , innovating , and getting pr , to boost your reputation and awareness .
return to the top question robin lewis , uk i 'd like to leave my existing job and join my former boss who has set up a new company in a related industry .
he 's indicated that he 'll be happy to match my current salary but also work in some plan around taking a share of the business - but to pay out over two to three years .
what are the options around structuring this arrangement - share options , handing over a chunk of the business , partnership etc . ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young all of these are options that you could follow , but they all have significant tax consequences , and you / your colleague should take professional advice .
further alternatives include buying shares at market value if the business has a current low value , but high expectations of future value growth and a " phantom option " , which would give you some of the benefits of a share of the business , but paid as a bonus on disposal .
share options - the emi scheme , which is designed to assist growing companies incentivise their staff , may be something to consider .
this is a share option scheme that allows for the granting of options over shares with a market value of up to £ 100,000 at grant .
any increase in value of the shares is potentially income tax-free , with the gain falling within the capital gains tax -lrb- cgt -rrb- regime , allowing you to take advantage of the taper relief and annual exemption .
there are strict criteria that need to be met by both the company and the option-holder before emi options can be granted , including the type of business , the size of the company and whether it trades wholly or mainly in the uk .
alternatively , there is the inland revenue approved share option scheme , which allows for the granting of options over shares worth £ 30,000 potentially income tax-free -lrb- with any gain once again potentially subject to cgt instead -rrb- .
" unapproved options " are extremely flexible as there is no limit to the value of options that may be granted , but they do not benefit from the income tax-relief of emi or approved share option schemes , which can make them very tax-inefficient .
it is possible that paye and nic will apply to any gain made in respect of the exercise of these share options .
handing over a chunk of the business - there have recently been sweeping changes to the taxation of individuals who receive shares by way of their office or employment .
as a result , unless the terms of the shares are considered carefully , any increase in value of those shares could be caught by income tax rather than capital gains tax .
paye and nic would therefore apply at a point where you would have no realisation to cover the tax payable .
partnership - in a partnership scenario , the tax treatment effectively looks through the entity to the individuals concerned .
llp status could be used to limit personal liability , although this remains an exposure .
you and your colleague may also find that customers and suppliers who are not used to this form of structure are less comfortable doing business with you .
there are also implications when you want to sell the business .
buy shares - the simplest and probably the most tax effective route , but it requires you to buy shares from your former boss now .
you might be able to come to some deferred payment approach with him , but any reduction below market interest rates on the borrowing would probably be taxable .
phantom option - this is effectively a bonus payable on performance over time or at an event -lrb- such as a sale -rrb- , calculated using some predetermined formula , on the notional value that you would have received had you had a share of the business .
it is taxed as a straight bonus -lrb- paye and nic -rrb- and is therefore not particularly tax-efficient .
return to the top question mac hippolyte , england i have a number of new business ideas floating around my head , and would like to know if there is a company or an individual that i could contact in order to run the ideas by them , before i begin to put together a full business plan .
i have spoken to friends and relatives , but their response may be a little biased , as you can imagine .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london without wishing to sound too self-promotional , that 's exactly what the business link network is for !
the primary aim of the organisation is to help small businesses and entrepreneurs survive and prosper through giving them access to impartial and targeted advice .
one of our core offers is business mentoring , where business advisers act as precisely what you 're looking for - a trusted sounding board and coach .
i suggest you contact your local business link : 0845 600 9 006 .
question rajindher singh , uk how would i find out about which grants are available and how i could apply for them ?
are they specific to the industry the company will be based in , e.g. grants for it equipment ?
are there any courses available , for free , to help learn about accounting etc ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are a huge variety of grants available to uk businesses and entrepreneurs , stemming from multiple sources : predominantly central government , local government and the european union .
in essence a grant is financial assistance , usually for a specific project , given to a business by an awarding body .
it provides funding to allow a business to undertake a specific project that , without such financial assistance , would not be able to proceed .
a grant is usually a one-off payment and will provide funding that covers a percentage of the costs of a specific project .
as a rule of thumb , most grants are based on the concept of matched funding , with the awarding body meeting up to 50 % of the costs of a project and the business meeting the remainder of the costs .
grants can not usually be used as working capital .
grants are available for a variety of projects , but each individual scheme will offer funding for a specific purpose .
if you 're looking to find out what grant funding is available in your area , one of the best places to start is your local business link .
most will have a directory of assistance available locally , nationally and at a european level .
in addition www.j4b.co.uk is a useful source of information , offering a free facility for businesses to search for grants that match their profile .
with regard to your query about free training , i would advise you to contact your local learning and skills council , which should be able to provide you with further information .
learn direct -lrb- www.learndirect.co.uk -rrb- may also be able to provide relevant distance learning courses .
return to the top question aaditya tangri , canada how old should i be to be able to apply for a loan from the bank ?
and what percentage of loans are provided for first-time business owners , say if i wanted to start a bar ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking generally in the uk , the age at which you can apply for finance is 18 , however , this differs between institutions and depends on the type of finance .
this may be different in canada and therefore you should approach one of your local banks for advice on their guidelines .
you do not mention how old you are , if you do wish to open a bar it is worth considering that the licensing laws in the uk state that a person must be 21 to hold a license to sell alcohol and therefore this would be likely to affect an application for finance to run a bar - again you should check the licensing laws for you own local region .
questions nick rogers , england i am thinking of setting up my own business and would like to know , in your experience , what are the main reasons for small business failures ?
and what are the key issues that most small business do not identify until it is too late ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the key to any successful business is planning for every eventuality .
doing this should make you aware of any potential pitfalls for your business before they occur .
there are , however , some factors that can affect the likely success of a business .
at natwest we undertook a piece of research to better understand these factors .
we found that the age of the business owner seems to affect the survival of a business more than any other factor , the greatest longevity was seen in those businesses with proprietors aged 45-60 .
other factors influencing success include the number of partners / proprietors in the business and having qualifications in the line of trade of the business .
there are a number of reasons why these elements have an effect - for example , younger people may find that they wish to return to salaried employment and this option is more available to them than to older entrepreneurs .
the greater the number of proprietors the more people there are to share your vision and some of the hard times that you may face .
overall , of the businesses that we surveyed , only 27 % of closures were as a result of financial difficulties , the others all closed through choice .
it should be remembered that each business is individual and the determination and commitment of the business owners can have just as much effect as any other factor on the success of the business .
if you are concerned about the viability of your proposition or feel you are lacking any of the skills necessary to make your business a success , look at using a business mentor or business advisor to guide you through the process .
return to the top question tony thomson , uk besides offering flexible working hours , how do you believe that a small business employing less than 10 people can motivate its employees at minimal cost ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school the short answer is teamwork .
hire people who want to be part of small dynamic business , set clear goals , and use high involvement methods to get them to help you find the most flexible , efficient and creative means for achieving goals and solving problems .
having a sense of ownership and responsibility , where success is celebrated and shared , is tremendously motivating .
the downside is instability through change .
so remember to make sure that you have best-practice routines for meeting , communicating and making decisions , to avoid things becoming anarchic and unstable .
let conflicts emerge and be dealt with about tasks , goals and processes , but keep a strict embargo on personal conflicts - these need to be taken and dealt with outside just between the concerned parties .
have fun , and good luck !
question robert stannard , uk i am working in germany at present , but my father , 73 , is still running the family business he started 23 years ago .
it 's a distribution business , selling aluminium profiles for the double glazing trade .
he employs about four to five people .
the question that is very much on my mind at the moment , is should i try to return home from germany to take over the business ?
the reason i have n't involved myself in the business up to now is that my father is a very strong character , who has always wielded a very tight control over the business , so i have never felt confident to work in the business .
turnover is more than £ 1m pounds a year .
it used to be more but there are some issues to face , such as an aggressive local competitor and also a shift in direction in the industry .
we have discussed options , such as trying to find a buyer for the business , though we do n't know where to turn for that and how do you value a business ?
also we thought about employing someone to run it , but my father has always been reluctant , saying the company ca n't afford to employ a manager .
it 's true as an owner you must have a completely different attitude to the business as an employee , but my view has always been if the manager is incentivised enough then that should be a good enough spur .
can you advise on what could / should be done ?
is there a mechanism where we could seek some advice ?
should i return to uk to take over the business ?
i just feel i would regret it if we did n't have the business anymore , and yet i do n't know if i could manage it .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you face an interesting and important decision .
at one level it is a matter for you to search your heart on .
it will be a major turning point for you , and you have to decide if you 're up for it .
i can say , though , that many others have trodden the same path , and for some of those it has proved to be an important new beginning .
it sounds as if you feel a strong pull .
in which case go with it in the spirit of undertaking a voyage of discovery , including about yourself .
the second level , is that it is to do with you and your dad .
i guess it could please him greatly for you to become involved , which could be a significant lever for you to persuade him of the need to let go so you can play your part without forever feeling him looking over your shoulder .
for the founder-owner letting go is often the toughest transition for someone for whom the business is in their blood and bones .
it will be important for you to construct an active helping role for dad , or some new project that will really absorb him .
it is probably no alternative for him to retire to the golf course , unless that is what he really wants .
one of the changes that may be due is , as you have foreseen , the appointment of a professional manager .
this need not be a problem - for if you get the right person it should pay for itself as an investment .
you will need to follow the many family businesses for whom embracing non-family executives into the extended family of the firm is a critical success factor .
you mention some uncertainty about the value of the business and your financial options .
you should seek specialist advice on this , and there are a number of excellent specialist advisory firms in this area .
look up the family firm institute on the web - they are an association of advisors who can find you someone or some agency offering services at a location and price to suit you .
however , the question sell or run , is not just a financial call .
you have to factor in the spirit that you will bring to the business as it will become , rather than just calculating its value as it stands at present .
return to the top question lee dunstan , uk i currently have an empty property -lrb- my former residence -rrb- which i am now looking to let .
as any further income i will receive on top of my full-time salary will fall into the higher tax bracket , i am considering setting up a limited liability property company to let out this property , and hopefully others with the proceeds .
is there anything particular that i should consider from a tax or legal point of view in this circumstance ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london property investment companies have become quite popular in recent years as people look to cash in on the corporation-tax starting rate which allows a company to make a profit of up to £ 10,000 p.a. without paying any corporation tax .
while this certainly looks more attractive than paying 40 % as a higher rate taxpayer , it is only one of the factors you need to bear in mind before transferring the property to a company .
what may be very efficient in terms of income tax may be detrimental in terms of other taxes - notably capital gains tax and stamp duty .
if you are planning to build up a property portfolio then the fact that you are paying less tax on your rental income should allow you to build this up quicker , thus increasing your rental yield in the long term .
however , you should be aware that there are likely to be further tax consequences when you extract any profits from the company .
you should also consider the capital gains tax consequences when the property is eventually sold - companies will pay corporation tax on both their income and capital gains at rates ranging from 0 % to 32.75 % .
individuals will pay up to 40 % on any capital gains but seeing as the property you mention is your former residence you may be able to benefit from principle private residence relief , which exempts any capital gains made on the disposal of your home .
even after you move out of your house you are given a three-year period in which to sell your home before you lose the relief .
additionally , you may be able to claim an extra allowance of up to £ 40,000 , providing the property is let as a ' dwelling house ' .
all in all it may be possible to rent out your property for five or six years after moving out before any gain becomes susceptible to capital gains tax .
given the sums of money involved , you should probably take professional advice on the various income , corporation and capital taxation issues .
you should also be aware that there may be stamp duty complications and there are costs in running a company .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

question patrick bailey philpott , essex i am 13 years old and have formed my own business , sr & c limited .
i am considering starting my own marketing-oriented website in the near future but i do n't know where to start and , being 13 , i do n't know how to write a well-structured business plan .
i just do n't know what to do next and i really need some expert advice .
what shall i do ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop so what is your business ?
the title does n't give anything away .
well at this moment in time you are definitely going about it the wrong way .
you want to start a business but you do n't know what -lrb- why should you at your age ? -rrb- .
you think it might be market-oriented but only thinking .
i would really encourage you to spend the next couple of years shaping and defining the product or the service .
learn from everyone , ask questions , irritate by curiosity .
decide what your passion is and go from there .
forget business plans , or marketing plans or any other plans .
they mean diddly-squat .
the idea is king .
nothing else matters .
you can buy business plans off the shelf !
but you have to find out for yourself what and how your idea separates you from anyone else in the field you want to work in .
also -lrb- and this is a really good piece of advice -rrb- do n't think business , think livelihood !
question khalid muhmood , vietnam my wife and i have built a successful education and training business in vietnam which we would like to develop regionally .
i would appreciate your advice on what you feel was the most important factor in your success in expanding the body shop worldwide ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop having the product right and making sure everyone knew about it .
shout it from the rooftops .
communication of what the product is , is of primary importance .
if you want to expand , try franchising - by that i mean in its simplest definition you have the ownership of the product , you train others in your methods and they , the franchisee , invest in the overhead costs .
for me it was the only path to expansion as i had no money .
return to the top question neil darbar , england my wife runs a mobile catering business where we serve whole-day breakfasts in an industrial site and is doing very well .
though i say it myself , she is a brilliant cook and has several recipes of indian foods which are unheard of in the uk - and we all know how much the british public love indian foods .
we often cater at local events , specialising in indian foods and make a sauce which is so popular that we have been asked time and time again about the possibility of buying it in the shops .
could you please guide us on how to go about it as we think it would be an instant success if marketed correctly .
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer at cobra , we certainly know how much the british public loves indian food !
the short answer to your question is that it depends on what sort of production facilities you currently have .
if you can only produce enough sauce for small numbers of people then start off locally .
the best way would be to invest in some bespoke packaging , which could be as simple as sticky labels designed by yourselves -lrb- printed on your home computer -rrb- and stuck to plain containers .
if there is an interesting story behind the sauce , e.g. its history / origin , include it on the label .
then sell your sauce as an extra item on the mobile unit .
do some investigating and find some recipes that would complement your sauces .
print those on nicely designed paper and give them out with the pots .
do n't forget to try different styles of sauce too .
experiment on your regular customers and see if you can build up a small range of sauces .
when you try out new sauces , keep an eye on how that affects the sales of the original sauce - if you have two sauces but only the same sales , it might be more cost-effective just to stick with the one sauce .
try bringing in seasonal sauces -lrb- effectively limited editions , that could tie in with events in the calendar e.g. chinese new year -rrb- .
by constantly innovating you will keep the public 's interest and you 'll start to build up a reputation as sauce experts !
as soon as you are building up regular orders -lrb- even if it 's just one sauce -rrb- , take your success to the local newspapers and try to get them to write a feature on you .
you could offer a free delivery of the sauce to a number of their readers as an extra incentive to write an article .
armed with a great product , great sales and pr coverage , start targeting the local deli or takeaways in the area your mobile unit operates -lrb- to capitalise on the awareness you have created -rrb- .
provide the shops with the facilities to do tastings of the sauces i.e. ask them to put a tray of opened pots on the counter with bread sticks for customers try the product .
at this point , you might need to take your sauce and your story to your bank manger and invest in bigger production facilities and start expanding .
but make sure that you have the facilities to always meet demand - unreliable suppliers really annoy retailers .
as you grow , invest in the brand too , by improving the packaging , innovating , and getting pr , to boost your reputation and awareness .
return to the top question robin lewis , uk i 'd like to leave my existing job and join my former boss who has set up a new company in a related industry .
he 's indicated that he 'll be happy to match my current salary but also work in some plan around taking a share of the business - but to pay out over two to three years .
what are the options around structuring this arrangement - share options , handing over a chunk of the business , partnership etc . ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young all of these are options that you could follow , but they all have significant tax consequences , and you / your colleague should take professional advice .
further alternatives include buying shares at market value if the business has a current low value , but high expectations of future value growth and a " phantom option " , which would give you some of the benefits of a share of the business , but paid as a bonus on disposal .
share options - the emi scheme , which is designed to assist growing companies incentivise their staff , may be something to consider .
this is a share option scheme that allows for the granting of options over shares with a market value of up to £ 100,000 at grant .
any increase in value of the shares is potentially income tax-free , with the gain falling within the capital gains tax -lrb- cgt -rrb- regime , allowing you to take advantage of the taper relief and annual exemption .
there are strict criteria that need to be met by both the company and the option-holder before emi options can be granted , including the type of business , the size of the company and whether it trades wholly or mainly in the uk .
alternatively , there is the inland revenue approved share option scheme , which allows for the granting of options over shares worth £ 30,000 potentially income tax-free -lrb- with any gain once again potentially subject to cgt instead -rrb- .
" unapproved options " are extremely flexible as there is no limit to the value of options that may be granted , but they do not benefit from the income tax-relief of emi or approved share option schemes , which can make them very tax-inefficient .
it is possible that paye and nic will apply to any gain made in respect of the exercise of these share options .
handing over a chunk of the business - there have recently been sweeping changes to the taxation of individuals who receive shares by way of their office or employment .
as a result , unless the terms of the shares are considered carefully , any increase in value of those shares could be caught by income tax rather than capital gains tax .
paye and nic would therefore apply at a point where you would have no realisation to cover the tax payable .
partnership - in a partnership scenario , the tax treatment effectively looks through the entity to the individuals concerned .
llp status could be used to limit personal liability , although this remains an exposure .
you and your colleague may also find that customers and suppliers who are not used to this form of structure are less comfortable doing business with you .
there are also implications when you want to sell the business .
buy shares - the simplest and probably the most tax effective route , but it requires you to buy shares from your former boss now .
you might be able to come to some deferred payment approach with him , but any reduction below market interest rates on the borrowing would probably be taxable .
phantom option - this is effectively a bonus payable on performance over time or at an event -lrb- such as a sale -rrb- , calculated using some predetermined formula , on the notional value that you would have received had you had a share of the business .
it is taxed as a straight bonus -lrb- paye and nic -rrb- and is therefore not particularly tax-efficient .
return to the top question mac hippolyte , england i have a number of new business ideas floating around my head , and would like to know if there is a company or an individual that i could contact in order to run the ideas by them , before i begin to put together a full business plan .
i have spoken to friends and relatives , but their response may be a little biased , as you can imagine .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london without wishing to sound too self-promotional , that 's exactly what the business link network is for !
the primary aim of the organisation is to help small businesses and entrepreneurs survive and prosper through giving them access to impartial and targeted advice .
one of our core offers is business mentoring , where business advisers act as precisely what you 're looking for - a trusted sounding board and coach .
i suggest you contact your local business link : 0845 600 9 006 .
question rajindher singh , uk how would i find out about which grants are available and how i could apply for them ?
are they specific to the industry the company will be based in , e.g. grants for it equipment ?
are there any courses available , for free , to help learn about accounting etc ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are a huge variety of grants available to uk businesses and entrepreneurs , stemming from multiple sources : predominantly central government , local government and the european union .
in essence a grant is financial assistance , usually for a specific project , given to a business by an awarding body .
it provides funding to allow a business to undertake a specific project that , without such financial assistance , would not be able to proceed .
a grant is usually a one-off payment and will provide funding that covers a percentage of the costs of a specific project .
as a rule of thumb , most grants are based on the concept of matched funding , with the awarding body meeting up to 50 % of the costs of a project and the business meeting the remainder of the costs .
grants can not usually be used as working capital .
grants are available for a variety of projects , but each individual scheme will offer funding for a specific purpose .
if you 're looking to find out what grant funding is available in your area , one of the best places to start is your local business link .
most will have a directory of assistance available locally , nationally and at a european level .
in addition www.j4b.co.uk is a useful source of information , offering a free facility for businesses to search for grants that match their profile .
with regard to your query about free training , i would advise you to contact your local learning and skills council , which should be able to provide you with further information .
learn direct -lrb- www.learndirect.co.uk -rrb- may also be able to provide relevant distance learning courses .
return to the top question aaditya tangri , canada how old should i be to be able to apply for a loan from the bank ?
and what percentage of loans are provided for first-time business owners , say if i wanted to start a bar ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking generally in the uk , the age at which you can apply for finance is 18 , however , this differs between institutions and depends on the type of finance .
this may be different in canada and therefore you should approach one of your local banks for advice on their guidelines .
you do not mention how old you are , if you do wish to open a bar it is worth considering that the licensing laws in the uk state that a person must be 21 to hold a license to sell alcohol and therefore this would be likely to affect an application for finance to run a bar - again you should check the licensing laws for you own local region .
questions nick rogers , england i am thinking of setting up my own business and would like to know , in your experience , what are the main reasons for small business failures ?
and what are the key issues that most small business do not identify until it is too late ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the key to any successful business is planning for every eventuality .
doing this should make you aware of any potential pitfalls for your business before they occur .
there are , however , some factors that can affect the likely success of a business .
at natwest we undertook a piece of research to better understand these factors .
we found that the age of the business owner seems to affect the survival of a business more than any other factor , the greatest longevity was seen in those businesses with proprietors aged 45-60 .
other factors influencing success include the number of partners / proprietors in the business and having qualifications in the line of trade of the business .
there are a number of reasons why these elements have an effect - for example , younger people may find that they wish to return to salaried employment and this option is more available to them than to older entrepreneurs .
the greater the number of proprietors the more people there are to share your vision and some of the hard times that you may face .
overall , of the businesses that we surveyed , only 27 % of closures were as a result of financial difficulties , the others all closed through choice .
it should be remembered that each business is individual and the determination and commitment of the business owners can have just as much effect as any other factor on the success of the business .
if you are concerned about the viability of your proposition or feel you are lacking any of the skills necessary to make your business a success , look at using a business mentor or business advisor to guide you through the process .
return to the top question tony thomson , uk besides offering flexible working hours , how do you believe that a small business employing less than 10 people can motivate its employees at minimal cost ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school the short answer is teamwork .
hire people who want to be part of small dynamic business , set clear goals , and use high involvement methods to get them to help you find the most flexible , efficient and creative means for achieving goals and solving problems .
having a sense of ownership and responsibility , where success is celebrated and shared , is tremendously motivating .
the downside is instability through change .
so remember to make sure that you have best-practice routines for meeting , communicating and making decisions , to avoid things becoming anarchic and unstable .
let conflicts emerge and be dealt with about tasks , goals and processes , but keep a strict embargo on personal conflicts - these need to be taken and dealt with outside just between the concerned parties .
have fun , and good luck !
question robert stannard , uk i am working in germany at present , but my father , 73 , is still running the family business he started 23 years ago .
it 's a distribution business , selling aluminium profiles for the double glazing trade .
he employs about four to five people .
the question that is very much on my mind at the moment , is should i try to return home from germany to take over the business ?
the reason i have n't involved myself in the business up to now is that my father is a very strong character , who has always wielded a very tight control over the business , so i have never felt confident to work in the business .
turnover is more than £ 1m pounds a year .
it used to be more but there are some issues to face , such as an aggressive local competitor and also a shift in direction in the industry .
we have discussed options , such as trying to find a buyer for the business , though we do n't know where to turn for that and how do you value a business ?
also we thought about employing someone to run it , but my father has always been reluctant , saying the company ca n't afford to employ a manager .
it 's true as an owner you must have a completely different attitude to the business as an employee , but my view has always been if the manager is incentivised enough then that should be a good enough spur .
can you advise on what could / should be done ?
is there a mechanism where we could seek some advice ?
should i return to uk to take over the business ?
i just feel i would regret it if we did n't have the business anymore , and yet i do n't know if i could manage it .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you face an interesting and important decision .
at one level it is a matter for you to search your heart on .
it will be a major turning point for you , and you have to decide if you 're up for it .
i can say , though , that many others have trodden the same path , and for some of those it has proved to be an important new beginning .
it sounds as if you feel a strong pull .
in which case go with it in the spirit of undertaking a voyage of discovery , including about yourself .
the second level , is that it is to do with you and your dad .
i guess it could please him greatly for you to become involved , which could be a significant lever for you to persuade him of the need to let go so you can play your part without forever feeling him looking over your shoulder .
for the founder-owner letting go is often the toughest transition for someone for whom the business is in their blood and bones .
it will be important for you to construct an active helping role for dad , or some new project that will really absorb him .
it is probably no alternative for him to retire to the golf course , unless that is what he really wants .
one of the changes that may be due is , as you have foreseen , the appointment of a professional manager .
this need not be a problem - for if you get the right person it should pay for itself as an investment .
you will need to follow the many family businesses for whom embracing non-family executives into the extended family of the firm is a critical success factor .
you mention some uncertainty about the value of the business and your financial options .
you should seek specialist advice on this , and there are a number of excellent specialist advisory firms in this area .
look up the family firm institute on the web - they are an association of advisors who can find you someone or some agency offering services at a location and price to suit you .
however , the question sell or run , is not just a financial call .
you have to factor in the spirit that you will bring to the business as it will become , rather than just calculating its value as it stands at present .
return to the top question lee dunstan , uk i currently have an empty property -lrb- my former residence -rrb- which i am now looking to let .
as any further income i will receive on top of my full-time salary will fall into the higher tax bracket , i am considering setting up a limited liability property company to let out this property , and hopefully others with the proceeds .
is there anything particular that i should consider from a tax or legal point of view in this circumstance ?

armed with a great product , great sales and pr coverage , start targeting the local deli or takeaways in the area your mobile unit operates -lrb- to capitalise on the awareness you have created -rrb- .
provide the shops with the facilities to do tastings of the sauces i.e. ask them to put a tray of opened pots on the counter with bread sticks for customers try the product .
at this point , you might need to take your sauce and your story to your bank manger and invest in bigger production facilities and start expanding .
but make sure that you have the facilities to always meet demand - unreliable suppliers really annoy retailers .
as you grow , invest in the brand too , by improving the packaging , innovating , and getting pr , to boost your reputation and awareness .
return to the top question robin lewis , uk i 'd like to leave my existing job and join my former boss who has set up a new company in a related industry .
he 's indicated that he 'll be happy to match my current salary but also work in some plan around taking a share of the business - but to pay out over two to three years .
what are the options around structuring this arrangement - share options , handing over a chunk of the business , partnership etc . ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young all of these are options that you could follow , but they all have significant tax consequences , and you / your colleague should take professional advice .
further alternatives include buying shares at market value if the business has a current low value , but high expectations of future value growth and a " phantom option " , which would give you some of the benefits of a share of the business , but paid as a bonus on disposal .
share options - the emi scheme , which is designed to assist growing companies incentivise their staff , may be something to consider .
this is a share option scheme that allows for the granting of options over shares with a market value of up to £ 100,000 at grant .
any increase in value of the shares is potentially income tax-free , with the gain falling within the capital gains tax -lrb- cgt -rrb- regime , allowing you to take advantage of the taper relief and annual exemption .
there are strict criteria that need to be met by both the company and the option-holder before emi options can be granted , including the type of business , the size of the company and whether it trades wholly or mainly in the uk .
alternatively , there is the inland revenue approved share option scheme , which allows for the granting of options over shares worth £ 30,000 potentially income tax-free -lrb- with any gain once again potentially subject to cgt instead -rrb- .
" unapproved options " are extremely flexible as there is no limit to the value of options that may be granted , but they do not benefit from the income tax-relief of emi or approved share option schemes , which can make them very tax-inefficient .
it is possible that paye and nic will apply to any gain made in respect of the exercise of these share options .
handing over a chunk of the business - there have recently been sweeping changes to the taxation of individuals who receive shares by way of their office or employment .
as a result , unless the terms of the shares are considered carefully , any increase in value of those shares could be caught by income tax rather than capital gains tax .
paye and nic would therefore apply at a point where you would have no realisation to cover the tax payable .
partnership - in a partnership scenario , the tax treatment effectively looks through the entity to the individuals concerned .
llp status could be used to limit personal liability , although this remains an exposure .
you and your colleague may also find that customers and suppliers who are not used to this form of structure are less comfortable doing business with you .
there are also implications when you want to sell the business .
buy shares - the simplest and probably the most tax effective route , but it requires you to buy shares from your former boss now .
you might be able to come to some deferred payment approach with him , but any reduction below market interest rates on the borrowing would probably be taxable .
phantom option - this is effectively a bonus payable on performance over time or at an event -lrb- such as a sale -rrb- , calculated using some predetermined formula , on the notional value that you would have received had you had a share of the business .
it is taxed as a straight bonus -lrb- paye and nic -rrb- and is therefore not particularly tax-efficient .
return to the top question mac hippolyte , england i have a number of new business ideas floating around my head , and would like to know if there is a company or an individual that i could contact in order to run the ideas by them , before i begin to put together a full business plan .
i have spoken to friends and relatives , but their response may be a little biased , as you can imagine .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london without wishing to sound too self-promotional , that 's exactly what the business link network is for !
the primary aim of the organisation is to help small businesses and entrepreneurs survive and prosper through giving them access to impartial and targeted advice .
one of our core offers is business mentoring , where business advisers act as precisely what you 're looking for - a trusted sounding board and coach .
i suggest you contact your local business link : 0845 600 9 006 .
question rajindher singh , uk how would i find out about which grants are available and how i could apply for them ?
are they specific to the industry the company will be based in , e.g. grants for it equipment ?
are there any courses available , for free , to help learn about accounting etc ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are a huge variety of grants available to uk businesses and entrepreneurs , stemming from multiple sources : predominantly central government , local government and the european union .
in essence a grant is financial assistance , usually for a specific project , given to a business by an awarding body .
it provides funding to allow a business to undertake a specific project that , without such financial assistance , would not be able to proceed .
a grant is usually a one-off payment and will provide funding that covers a percentage of the costs of a specific project .
as a rule of thumb , most grants are based on the concept of matched funding , with the awarding body meeting up to 50 % of the costs of a project and the business meeting the remainder of the costs .
grants can not usually be used as working capital .
grants are available for a variety of projects , but each individual scheme will offer funding for a specific purpose .
if you 're looking to find out what grant funding is available in your area , one of the best places to start is your local business link .
most will have a directory of assistance available locally , nationally and at a european level .
in addition www.j4b.co.uk is a useful source of information , offering a free facility for businesses to search for grants that match their profile .
with regard to your query about free training , i would advise you to contact your local learning and skills council , which should be able to provide you with further information .
learn direct -lrb- www.learndirect.co.uk -rrb- may also be able to provide relevant distance learning courses .
return to the top question aaditya tangri , canada how old should i be to be able to apply for a loan from the bank ?
and what percentage of loans are provided for first-time business owners , say if i wanted to start a bar ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking generally in the uk , the age at which you can apply for finance is 18 , however , this differs between institutions and depends on the type of finance .
this may be different in canada and therefore you should approach one of your local banks for advice on their guidelines .
you do not mention how old you are , if you do wish to open a bar it is worth considering that the licensing laws in the uk state that a person must be 21 to hold a license to sell alcohol and therefore this would be likely to affect an application for finance to run a bar - again you should check the licensing laws for you own local region .
questions nick rogers , england i am thinking of setting up my own business and would like to know , in your experience , what are the main reasons for small business failures ?
and what are the key issues that most small business do not identify until it is too late ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the key to any successful business is planning for every eventuality .
doing this should make you aware of any potential pitfalls for your business before they occur .
there are , however , some factors that can affect the likely success of a business .
at natwest we undertook a piece of research to better understand these factors .
we found that the age of the business owner seems to affect the survival of a business more than any other factor , the greatest longevity was seen in those businesses with proprietors aged 45-60 .
other factors influencing success include the number of partners / proprietors in the business and having qualifications in the line of trade of the business .
there are a number of reasons why these elements have an effect - for example , younger people may find that they wish to return to salaried employment and this option is more available to them than to older entrepreneurs .
the greater the number of proprietors the more people there are to share your vision and some of the hard times that you may face .
overall , of the businesses that we surveyed , only 27 % of closures were as a result of financial difficulties , the others all closed through choice .
it should be remembered that each business is individual and the determination and commitment of the business owners can have just as much effect as any other factor on the success of the business .
if you are concerned about the viability of your proposition or feel you are lacking any of the skills necessary to make your business a success , look at using a business mentor or business advisor to guide you through the process .
return to the top question tony thomson , uk besides offering flexible working hours , how do you believe that a small business employing less than 10 people can motivate its employees at minimal cost ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school the short answer is teamwork .
hire people who want to be part of small dynamic business , set clear goals , and use high involvement methods to get them to help you find the most flexible , efficient and creative means for achieving goals and solving problems .
having a sense of ownership and responsibility , where success is celebrated and shared , is tremendously motivating .
the downside is instability through change .
so remember to make sure that you have best-practice routines for meeting , communicating and making decisions , to avoid things becoming anarchic and unstable .
let conflicts emerge and be dealt with about tasks , goals and processes , but keep a strict embargo on personal conflicts - these need to be taken and dealt with outside just between the concerned parties .
have fun , and good luck !
question robert stannard , uk i am working in germany at present , but my father , 73 , is still running the family business he started 23 years ago .
it 's a distribution business , selling aluminium profiles for the double glazing trade .
he employs about four to five people .
the question that is very much on my mind at the moment , is should i try to return home from germany to take over the business ?
the reason i have n't involved myself in the business up to now is that my father is a very strong character , who has always wielded a very tight control over the business , so i have never felt confident to work in the business .
turnover is more than £ 1m pounds a year .
it used to be more but there are some issues to face , such as an aggressive local competitor and also a shift in direction in the industry .
we have discussed options , such as trying to find a buyer for the business , though we do n't know where to turn for that and how do you value a business ?
also we thought about employing someone to run it , but my father has always been reluctant , saying the company ca n't afford to employ a manager .
it 's true as an owner you must have a completely different attitude to the business as an employee , but my view has always been if the manager is incentivised enough then that should be a good enough spur .
can you advise on what could / should be done ?
is there a mechanism where we could seek some advice ?
should i return to uk to take over the business ?
i just feel i would regret it if we did n't have the business anymore , and yet i do n't know if i could manage it .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you face an interesting and important decision .
at one level it is a matter for you to search your heart on .
it will be a major turning point for you , and you have to decide if you 're up for it .
i can say , though , that many others have trodden the same path , and for some of those it has proved to be an important new beginning .
it sounds as if you feel a strong pull .
in which case go with it in the spirit of undertaking a voyage of discovery , including about yourself .
the second level , is that it is to do with you and your dad .
i guess it could please him greatly for you to become involved , which could be a significant lever for you to persuade him of the need to let go so you can play your part without forever feeling him looking over your shoulder .
for the founder-owner letting go is often the toughest transition for someone for whom the business is in their blood and bones .
it will be important for you to construct an active helping role for dad , or some new project that will really absorb him .
it is probably no alternative for him to retire to the golf course , unless that is what he really wants .
one of the changes that may be due is , as you have foreseen , the appointment of a professional manager .
this need not be a problem - for if you get the right person it should pay for itself as an investment .
you will need to follow the many family businesses for whom embracing non-family executives into the extended family of the firm is a critical success factor .
you mention some uncertainty about the value of the business and your financial options .
you should seek specialist advice on this , and there are a number of excellent specialist advisory firms in this area .
look up the family firm institute on the web - they are an association of advisors who can find you someone or some agency offering services at a location and price to suit you .
however , the question sell or run , is not just a financial call .
you have to factor in the spirit that you will bring to the business as it will become , rather than just calculating its value as it stands at present .
return to the top question lee dunstan , uk i currently have an empty property -lrb- my former residence -rrb- which i am now looking to let .
as any further income i will receive on top of my full-time salary will fall into the higher tax bracket , i am considering setting up a limited liability property company to let out this property , and hopefully others with the proceeds .
is there anything particular that i should consider from a tax or legal point of view in this circumstance ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london property investment companies have become quite popular in recent years as people look to cash in on the corporation-tax starting rate which allows a company to make a profit of up to £ 10,000 p.a. without paying any corporation tax .
while this certainly looks more attractive than paying 40 % as a higher rate taxpayer , it is only one of the factors you need to bear in mind before transferring the property to a company .
what may be very efficient in terms of income tax may be detrimental in terms of other taxes - notably capital gains tax and stamp duty .
if you are planning to build up a property portfolio then the fact that you are paying less tax on your rental income should allow you to build this up quicker , thus increasing your rental yield in the long term .
however , you should be aware that there are likely to be further tax consequences when you extract any profits from the company .
you should also consider the capital gains tax consequences when the property is eventually sold - companies will pay corporation tax on both their income and capital gains at rates ranging from 0 % to 32.75 % .
individuals will pay up to 40 % on any capital gains but seeing as the property you mention is your former residence you may be able to benefit from principle private residence relief , which exempts any capital gains made on the disposal of your home .
even after you move out of your house you are given a three-year period in which to sell your home before you lose the relief .
additionally , you may be able to claim an extra allowance of up to £ 40,000 , providing the property is let as a ' dwelling house ' .
all in all it may be possible to rent out your property for five or six years after moving out before any gain becomes susceptible to capital gains tax .
given the sums of money involved , you should probably take professional advice on the various income , corporation and capital taxation issues .
you should also be aware that there may be stamp duty complications and there are costs in running a company .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

a quarter of those questioned said there were good reasons for intolerance of some kind .
only 5 % of the 1,600 people questioned thought there was no discrimination in scotland while nearly 60 % felt disability rights had not gone far enough .
the findings are part of a survey commissioned by the scottish executive to look at attitudes towards gay people , the disabled , those in ethnic minorities and women .
with the row over section 28 in the past , experts said the survey suggests that about half of those living in scotland believe there is still a lot of homophobic and racial prejudice .
the research , being published on tuesday , also found that more than half the people in scotland consider there to be a great deal of prejudice against ethnic minority groups .
it also showed that older people with no qualifications were more likely to be intolerant , while knowing someone who is gay made people less likely to treat others differently . "
one alarming figure to come out of the survey is the fact that 28 % of people still feel that women make more suitable primary teachers than men " eocs the equal opportunities commission scotland -lrb- eocs -rrb- said the results showed many people found prejudice in areas of employment acceptable and added that more should be done to challenge attitudes .
a spokesman said : " one alarming figure to come out of the survey is the fact that 28 % of people still feel that women make more suitable primary teachers than men .
" this outmoded assumption does not just stereotype women it also prevents men from following a career of their choice . "
' negative attitudes ' those carrying out the survey had identified three possible reasons for discrimination continuing in scotland .
some people 's attitudes were found to be coloured by their own experiences in life , while others perceive those in certain minority groups as a threat to their economic success .
the most significant factor was said to be the image that some people have of those who they think are different from themselves .
the survey has been welcomed by the gay and lesbian equality group , stonewall scotland .
director ali jarvis told bbc radio scotland that the survey had showed up what they expected .
she added that scotland on the whole was not a prejudiced society but some entrenched pockets needed to be tackled . "
discriminatory attitudes are held for the most part only by a minority of scots , but in some cases that minority is not an inconsiderable one " prof john curtis " now the opportunity is to actually start shaping specific policies and interventions that can address , and perhaps work on changing , the negative attitudes that are out there - as well as building on the positive ones . "
maggie chettie , of the moving on racial equality in scotland group , said the survey offered " nothing new " on the issue of discrimination in scotland .
she said : " i would have been much more interested in looking at something much more focused , something looking at the mechanisms of institutionalised racism , rather than something which does nothing more than reiterate what we already know .
" we need something much more practical which is actually going to focus in on how can we overcome discrimination . "

a quarter of those questioned said there were good reasons for intolerance of some kind .
only 5 % of the 1,600 people questioned thought there was no discrimination in scotland while nearly 60 % felt disability rights had not gone far enough .
the findings are part of a survey commissioned by the scottish executive to look at attitudes towards gay people , the disabled , those in ethnic minorities and women .
with the row over section 28 in the past , experts said the survey suggests that about half of those living in scotland believe there is still a lot of homophobic and racial prejudice .
the research , being published on tuesday , also found that more than half the people in scotland consider there to be a great deal of prejudice against ethnic minority groups .
it also showed that older people with no qualifications were more likely to be intolerant , while knowing someone who is gay made people less likely to treat others differently .
one alarming figure to come out of the survey is the fact that 28 % of people still feel that women make more suitable primary teachers than men eocs the equal opportunities commission scotland -lrb- eocs -rrb- said the results showed many people found prejudice in areas of employment acceptable and added that more should be done to challenge attitudes .
a spokesman said : " one alarming figure to come out of the survey is the fact that 28 % of people still feel that women make more suitable primary teachers than men .
" this outmoded assumption does not just stereotype women it also prevents men from following a career of their choice . "
' negative attitudes ' those carrying out the survey had identified three possible reasons for discrimination continuing in scotland .
some people 's attitudes were found to be coloured by their own experiences in life , while others perceive those in certain minority groups as a threat to their economic success .
the most significant factor was said to be the image that some people have of those who they think are different from themselves .
the survey has been welcomed by the gay and lesbian equality group , stonewall scotland .
director ali jarvis told bbc radio scotland that the survey had showed up what they expected .
she added that scotland on the whole was not a prejudiced society but some entrenched pockets needed to be tackled .
discriminatory attitudes are held for the most part only by a minority of scots , but in some cases that minority is not an inconsiderable one prof john curtis " now the opportunity is to actually start shaping specific policies and interventions that can address , and perhaps work on changing , the negative attitudes that are out there - as well as building on the positive ones . "
maggie chettie , of the moving on racial equality in scotland group , said the survey offered " nothing new " on the issue of discrimination in scotland .
she said : " i would have been much more interested in looking at something much more focused , something looking at the mechanisms of institutionalised racism , rather than something which does nothing more than reiterate what we already know .
" we need something much more practical which is actually going to focus in on how can we overcome discrimination . "

" if we were an airline , " says george mortimer , managing director of the standard chartered bank in cameroon , " we would only take first- and business-class passengers . "
standard chartered wants to go up-market " if clients can afford to travel in first and business class then they have a right to quality service , " he says , " and it 's the same for a bank . "
unfortunately , for the british bank 's existing " economy class " customers , this means they will have to deposit over £ 2,000 before the end of the year or have their account closed .
a glance into the standard chartered branch in the commercial capital , douala , proves that the ambience is currently more economy class check-in hall than first class lounge .
on the face of it , this is at odds with their public image dr malaika culverwell , royal institute of international affairs clammy people fan themselves with paying-in slips as they shuffle forward to deposit small cheques ; harassed tellers fill hold-alls with grubby banknotes destined for a cocoa auction in the bush ; while young men splayed across chairs beneath the air conditioning start to snore .
it is an image the managing director needs to shed .
" our target market is top end .
that is , multinationals , embassies , big ngos , the government , " says george mortimer .
" so we need to maintain service levels .
statements must arrive on time , staff must n't get distracted , someone important needs to be dealt with efficiently . "
new rules , new image so standard chartered in cameroon is effectively cutting off the mass market .
letters have gone out to all retail customers advising that the new minimum balance for personal accounts is 2,000,000 cfa -lrb- £ 2,200 -rrb- and for business accounts 5,000,000 cfa -lrb- £ 5,500 -rrb- seventy percent of cameroon 's economy is from the rural areas ...
it is our duty to help formalise this community - they need cash and they need know-how dr simeon numdem afriland first bank for a vast majority of cameroonians , that is an impossible figure .
an accountant in a mid-sized firm , for example , might expect to take home 400,000 cfa per month -lrb- £ 440 -rrb- , so the minimum balance itself would represent half a year 's salary .
mr mortimer is not expecting many small clients to stay on board .
part of the reason for dropping the mass-market business is because most of the current customers maintain a tiny balance but make many cash transactions - so generating high traffic but low revenue for the bank .
" on the face of it , this is at odds with their public image , " says dr malaika culverwell , a senior research fellow in corporate social responsibility from the royal institute of international affairs .
" standard chartered wants to be perceived as being socially responsible , " she says .
" their core values focus on emerging markets , ethics and being a friend to small business . "
serving or selling out ?
the bank 's website trumpets its reputation as a bank which serves the african people .
" at standard chartered , we are committed to the communities and environments in which we operate , " it states .
credit groups have been a lifeline for rural entrepreneurs " our operations are focused on the emerging markets ... where we believe we can be a legitimate influence for good . "
dr culverwell concludes that the bank may need to change its corporate image if it continues to cold-shoulder the majority of the cameroonian market .
even its philanthropic efforts - such as building a maternity hospital in the small cameroonian town of foumban earlier this year - may not save its reputation .
as dr culverwell points out , sustainable partnerships are preferable to one-off handouts when it comes to earning brownie points .

" if we were an airline , " says george mortimer , managing director of the standard chartered bank in cameroon , " we would only take first- and business-class passengers . "
standard chartered wants to go up-market " if clients can afford to travel in first and business class then they have a right to quality service , " he says , " and it 's the same for a bank . "
unfortunately , for the british bank 's existing " economy class " customers , this means they will have to deposit over £ 2,000 before the end of the year or have their account closed .
a glance into the standard chartered branch in the commercial capital , douala , proves that the ambience is currently more economy class check-in hall than first class lounge .
on the face of it , this is at odds with their public image dr malaika culverwell , royal institute of international affairs clammy people fan themselves with paying-in slips as they shuffle forward to deposit small cheques ; harassed tellers fill hold-alls with grubby banknotes destined for a cocoa auction in the bush ; while young men splayed across chairs beneath the air conditioning start to snore .
it is an image the managing director needs to shed .
" our target market is top end .
that is , multinationals , embassies , big ngos , the government , " says george mortimer .
" so we need to maintain service levels .
statements must arrive on time , staff must n't get distracted , someone important needs to be dealt with efficiently . "
new rules , new image so standard chartered in cameroon is effectively cutting off the mass market .
letters have gone out to all retail customers advising that the new minimum balance for personal accounts is 2,000,000 cfa -lrb- £ 2,200 -rrb- and for business accounts 5,000,000 cfa -lrb- £ 5,500 -rrb- seventy percent of cameroon 's economy is from the rural areas ...
it is our duty to help formalise this community - they need cash and they need know-how dr simeon numdem afriland first bank for a vast majority of cameroonians , that is an impossible figure .
an accountant in a mid-sized firm , for example , might expect to take home 400,000 cfa per month -lrb- £ 440 -rrb- , so the minimum balance itself would represent half a year 's salary .
mr mortimer is not expecting many small clients to stay on board .
part of the reason for dropping the mass-market business is because most of the current customers maintain a tiny balance but make many cash transactions - so generating high traffic but low revenue for the bank .
" on the face of it , this is at odds with their public image , " says dr malaika culverwell , a senior research fellow in corporate social responsibility from the royal institute of international affairs .
" standard chartered wants to be perceived as being socially responsible , " she says .
" their core values focus on emerging markets , ethics and being a friend to small business . "
serving or selling out ?
the bank 's website trumpets its reputation as a bank which serves the african people .
" at standard chartered , we are committed to the communities and environments in which we operate , " it states .
credit groups have been a lifeline for rural entrepreneurs " our operations are focused on the emerging markets ... where we believe we can be a legitimate influence for good . "
dr culverwell concludes that the bank may need to change its corporate image if it continues to cold-shoulder the majority of the cameroonian market .
even its philanthropic efforts - such as building a maternity hospital in the small cameroonian town of foumban earlier this year - may not save its reputation .
as dr culverwell points out , sustainable partnerships are preferable to one-off handouts when it comes to earning brownie points .
no tailored service for many cameroonians , the move will reaffirm a belief that european banks are not specialised enough to cater for the needs of the african market place .
