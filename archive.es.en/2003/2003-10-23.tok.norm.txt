a federal administrative court in leipzig ruled on thursday that global claims made by the jcc are valid .
however , they must include references from which a former jewish property owner can be determined at a later date .
according to german restititution law , expropriation claims for property in the territory of the former east germany had to be made by the end of 1992 .
but since the jcc often did not have the necessary details for individual claims by that date , they filed global claims .
these included references to files or archives , which contained the information on individual cases .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .

what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .
the association of dutch municipalities said it wanted to wait for definite plans before assessing reactions from its member councils . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .

" today china is the savior for many , " klaus grimm , the head of german industry and commerce -lrb- gic -rrb- in china , an organization aligned to the german chamber of commerce , told reuters .
around 2,000 german firms are active in china , according to grimm . cheap labor , many markets only the giants of german industry had dipped their toes into the chinese market until recently , mainly through joint ventures with chinese state firms .
then china started producing cheap products that were sold in the world 's richer countries , and the economic boom began .
now german small and medium-sized companies are also starting to discover china .
instead of making products to sell abroad , the germans are producing for the domestic market of 1.2 billion chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one result of opening to foreign trade companies too is that the quality of domestic producers has become noticeably better , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of germany 's metro retail group .
" that shows that competition leads to a better supply for the population , normally at favorable prices and of a higher quality . " metro employs 5,000 people in china in its 18 cash & carry markets .
its turnover has reached € 600 million -lrb- $ 706 million -rrb- in china , slightly more than 1 percent of the group 's entire yearly turnover .
the company plans to increase total asian turnover to 10 percent by 2010 . but metro has determined that china is not just one big market .
" china is a continent , " körber stressed .
he explained that metro had had to adjust to china 's size , which meant addressing numerous regional markets . german know-how for its part , china is keen on learning from germany , illustrated by the fact that 30,000 chinese are students at german universities . " germany has very competent producers , good products and very good engineering , " hong xing , the vice chairman of brilliance china automobile holding , said .
" and china needs all that .
we 're just getting started ...
but we have a large and growing market and cheap labor . " when german chancellor gerhard schröder visits china in nearly a month , the gic intended to announce it would open a fourth office - after shanghai , beijing and guangzhou - in the southwestern city of chengdu . but a clouds have moved in on the horizon : chinese authorities have refused to renew the gic 's business license in shanghai and grimm and his four german colleagues have lost their residence permits . the chinese were responding to a german media report alleging 50 german companies had complained that the gic was competing with them by offering legal , training and visa services to small and medium-sized companies .
the chinese authorities are now investigating the german business delegation 's practices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw places big bet on china german automaker volkswagen plans a massive investment push in china that will nearly double its production there .
but some worry that the country 's once-insatiable auto market may soon be facing a glut .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .

what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .
the association of dutch municipalities said it wanted to wait for definite plans before assessing reactions from its member councils . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .

both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .

possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.10.2003 german television enters the digital age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test stripes are a relict of television 's past .
the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .
when that happens , and the coach-potato actually starts interacting with the tube , television will truly have entered a new era . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin ’ s tv goes digital the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv -lrb- aug .

" today china is the savior for many , " klaus grimm , the head of german industry and commerce -lrb- gic -rrb- in china , an organization aligned to the german chamber of commerce , told reuters .
around 2,000 german firms are active in china , according to grimm . cheap labor , many markets only the giants of german industry had dipped their toes into the chinese market until recently , mainly through joint ventures with chinese state firms .
then china started producing cheap products that were sold in the world 's richer countries , and the economic boom began .
now german small and medium-sized companies are also starting to discover china .
instead of making products to sell abroad , the germans are producing for the domestic market of 1.2 billion chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one result of opening to foreign trade companies too is that the quality of domestic producers has become noticeably better , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of germany 's metro retail group .
" that shows that competition leads to a better supply for the population , normally at favorable prices and of a higher quality . " metro employs 5,000 people in china in its 18 cash & carry markets .
its turnover has reached € 600 million -lrb- $ 706 million -rrb- in china , slightly more than 1 percent of the group 's entire yearly turnover .
the company plans to increase total asian turnover to 10 percent by 2010 . but metro has determined that china is not just one big market .
" china is a continent , " körber stressed .
he explained that metro had had to adjust to china 's size , which meant addressing numerous regional markets . german know-how for its part , china is keen on learning from germany , illustrated by the fact that 30,000 chinese are students at german universities . " germany has very competent producers , good products and very good engineering , " hong xing , the vice chairman of brilliance china automobile holding , said .
" and china needs all that .
we 're just getting started ...
but we have a large and growing market and cheap labor . " when german chancellor gerhard schröder visits china in nearly a month , the gic intended to announce it would open a fourth office - after shanghai , beijing and guangzhou - in the southwestern city of chengdu . but a clouds have moved in on the horizon : chinese authorities have refused to renew the gic 's business license in shanghai and grimm and his four german colleagues have lost their residence permits . the chinese were responding to a german media report alleging 50 german companies had complained that the gic was competing with them by offering legal , training and visa services to small and medium-sized companies .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.10.2003 german television enters the digital age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test stripes are a relict of television 's past .
the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .
when that happens , and the coach-potato actually starts interacting with the tube , television will truly have entered a new era . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin ’ s tv goes digital the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv -lrb- aug .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.10.2003 german television enters the digital age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test stripes are a relict of television 's past .
the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .
when that happens , and the coach-potato actually starts interacting with the tube , television will truly have entered a new era . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin ’ s tv goes digital the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .
the association of dutch municipalities said it wanted to wait for definite plans before assessing reactions from its member councils . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .

a federal administrative court in leipzig ruled on thursday that global claims made by the jcc are valid .
however , they must include references from which a former jewish property owner can be determined at a later date .
according to german restititution law , expropriation claims for property in the territory of the former east germany had to be made by the end of 1992 .
but since the jcc often did not have the necessary details for individual claims by that date , they filed global claims .
these included references to files or archives , which contained the information on individual cases .
the concrete data was then supplied later .
the court ruling has now upheld this procedure . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- tougher air safety rules spark debate 22.10.2003 -pipe- german families love , but do they show it ? 22.10.2003 -pipe- the future of german energy policy outlined 22.10.2003 -pipe- germany to do more to fight aids 21.10.2003 -pipe- schröder defends eu constitution draft 21.10.2003 -pipe- extremists on trial for arson attacks 21.10.2003 -pipe- germany 's jewish population soars 21.10.2003 -pipe- bulgaria investigates german spy scandal 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

managers from china and germany met in berlin to discuss business opportunities .
german managers ' eyes flash euro signs ; their chinese colleagues praise german know-how . china 's economy is booming .
at 7 to 8 percent rates , the country 's growth has reached a level that economically stagnant germany can only dream of . but germany has a share in the growth too , as the country 's biggest european investor .
it injected € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- of the roughly € 53 billion -lrb- $ 62 billion -rrb- in foreign direct investments in china in 2002 .
last year it overtook japan as the most important asian country for german exports . " china is the most dynamic gravitation center in the southeast-asian area , " federation of german industries head michael rogowski said at a sino-german business conference sponsored by the magazine wirtschaftswoche on oct .

" today china is the savior for many , " klaus grimm , the head of german industry and commerce -lrb- gic -rrb- in china , an organization aligned to the german chamber of commerce , told reuters .
around 2,000 german firms are active in china , according to grimm . cheap labor , many markets only the giants of german industry had dipped their toes into the chinese market until recently , mainly through joint ventures with chinese state firms .
then china started producing cheap products that were sold in the world 's richer countries , and the economic boom began .

the company plans to increase total asian turnover to 10 percent by 2010 . but metro has determined that china is not just one big market .
" china is a continent , " körber stressed .
he explained that metro had had to adjust to china 's size , which meant addressing numerous regional markets . german know-how for its part , china is keen on learning from germany , illustrated by the fact that 30,000 chinese are students at german universities . " germany has very competent producers , good products and very good engineering , " hong xing , the vice chairman of brilliance china automobile holding , said .
" and china needs all that .
we 're just getting started ...

around 2,000 german firms are active in china , according to grimm . cheap labor , many markets only the giants of german industry had dipped their toes into the chinese market until recently , mainly through joint ventures with chinese state firms .
then china started producing cheap products that were sold in the world 's richer countries , and the economic boom began .
now german small and medium-sized companies are also starting to discover china .
instead of making products to sell abroad , the germans are producing for the domestic market of 1.2 billion chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one result of opening to foreign trade companies too is that the quality of domestic producers has become noticeably better , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of germany 's metro retail group .
" that shows that competition leads to a better supply for the population , normally at favorable prices and of a higher quality . " metro employs 5,000 people in china in its 18 cash & carry markets .
its turnover has reached € 600 million -lrb- $ 706 million -rrb- in china , slightly more than 1 percent of the group 's entire yearly turnover .
the company plans to increase total asian turnover to 10 percent by 2010 . but metro has determined that china is not just one big market .
" china is a continent , " körber stressed .
he explained that metro had had to adjust to china 's size , which meant addressing numerous regional markets . german know-how for its part , china is keen on learning from germany , illustrated by the fact that 30,000 chinese are students at german universities . " germany has very competent producers , good products and very good engineering , " hong xing , the vice chairman of brilliance china automobile holding , said .
" and china needs all that .
we 're just getting started ...
but we have a large and growing market and cheap labor . " when german chancellor gerhard schröder visits china in nearly a month , the gic intended to announce it would open a fourth office - after shanghai , beijing and guangzhou - in the southwestern city of chengdu . but a clouds have moved in on the horizon : chinese authorities have refused to renew the gic 's business license in shanghai and grimm and his four german colleagues have lost their residence permits . the chinese were responding to a german media report alleging 50 german companies had complained that the gic was competing with them by offering legal , training and visa services to small and medium-sized companies .
the chinese authorities are now investigating the german business delegation 's practices . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw places big bet on china german automaker volkswagen plans a massive investment push in china that will nearly double its production there .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .
that monumental process was set in stone earlier this week when the director generals of the public broadcasting stations and the leading private channels signed a deal agreeing to start broadcasting digitally for selected regions in the north and west of the country .
the next regions to make the switchover are bremen and the cologne-bonn metropolitan area .
the two regions will go digital in may 2004 and will be followed closely by düsseldorf , hamburg , lübeck and the industrial ruhr valley around essen and dortmund .
by the end of 2005 some 13 million households will have switched from analog to digital television .
terrestrial comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv and radio antenna the end of the analog age has been referred to as the chance for terrestrial transmission .
what until now has had little chance of competing against the more popular and innovative cable and satellite will enjoy a much-needed boost when germans start purchasing decoder sets to convert their rooftop antennas into receivers for digital transmission .
fritz pleitgen , director general of public broadcaster wdr , applauded the move towards all-around digital tv as the " comeback " for terrestrial transmission .
" i ’ m convinced that with the help of dvb-t the program offering will be considerably greater than what is now available over antenna , " he said and added that starting in may 16 channels -lrb- eight private , eight public -rrb- will be broadcast over the air for the cologne-bonn region .
the jump in channel selection offered by dvb-t is clearly one of the key benefits for consumers .
by the end of 2004 everyone in the new digitalized regions will have the luxury of choosing from 24 different channels .
jobst plog , director general for ndr public broadcaster said that the new technology will make terrestrial reception just as attractive as cable and satellite .
all-around television bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the technological highlights of digital television , in addition to better quality pictures and a greater range of broadcasting selection , is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
" people can watch television in practically any corner of the house or garden and even traffic jams will be more endurable with dvb-t , " pleitgen said praising the merits of the digital format .
plus , with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , media analysts believe it is only a matter of time before tv programs start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches .
and new hybrid systems such as the much-talked about multimedia home platform -lrb- mhp -rrb- , which integrates television and other interactive information sources like the internet , come one step closer to digitizing the normal household .

the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.10.2003 german television enters the digital age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the test stripes are a relict of television 's past .
the days of fuzzy pictures and poor reception are numbered in germany .
after berlin became the first region to completely scrap analog terrestrial television , the rest of the country is now leaping into the digital age . unlike telephones and computers , terrestrial television - as free-to-air broadcast tv is know - hasn ’ t changed much in the last decades .
sure there were improvements in quality of image , more channels were added , cable was introduced and stereo sound surrounded us .
but since the advent of color tv in the 1950s , we ’ ve pretty much been viewing the tube the same way since it was invented - namely via broadcast analog radio waves .
but that ’ s about to change .
in some places the revolution - or better yet the evolution - of television is already underway .
in europe , digital video broadcasting , with its high quality image resolution and greater viewing possibilities , is quickly squeezing out normal analog television .
according to a 2002 study compiled by the european commission directorate general for the information society , about 18 percent of european households already receive television in a digital format .
nearly all european satellite-based pay-tv platforms are transmitted digitally , and about 80 percent of all european cable systems are outfitted for digital tv .
by 2006 the european commission expects that 65 percent of all europeans will have switched from analog to digital television and the vast majority of analog over-the-air broadcasters will cease to exist .
when compared to about 45 percent digitalization in the united states , that number puts the european union at the forefront of the new telecommunication technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and one of the forerunners in digital tv is germany .
although finland , great britain , spain and sweden were all quicker to introduce digital broadcasting , germany was the first country to implement digital television as the sole broadcasting format for an entire region .
pioneering spirit in berlin-brandenburg in august berlin-brandenburg broke with analog television and went exclusively digital .
it was the first time an entire region had made such a complete switch , and the world , or at least europe , watched curiously to see what would happen .
and the switchover went down relatively smoothly .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting , only about 20,000 had failed to purchase the necessary " set-top " boxes which decode the digital format for analog televisions .
the rest of the cities ’ television viewers didn ’ t notice much of a change since they had already been watching programs via cable or satellite equipped for the new digital format .
in fact only about 10 percent of german television viewers rely on a traditional terrestrial antenna for reception .
the majority , 60 percent , have cable and the rest satellite .
so the question of switching to digital video broadcasting-terrestrial -lrb- dvb-t -rrb- really only effects a small portion of the population , since cable and satellite transmissions have already begun phasing in the digital format without a lot of fanfare .
still , not everyone has made the leap into the digital era , especially in the more rural areas which depend on analog transmission .
for this reason , germany is slowly phasing in digital broadcasting region by region .
by 2010 , however , all television signals should be transmitted digitally .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .
but officials from the venlo city council and other municipalities are concerned by donner ’ s proposals , saying that they would result in an explosive increase in the illegal trade .
the association of dutch municipalities said it wanted to wait for definite plans before assessing reactions from its member councils . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes strides in the illegal drug fight german drugs commissioner marion caspers-merk announced the government 's drug overview for 2002 in berlin on tuesday .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

the teacher reportedly called for a holy war against the west in friday prayers at the facility 's mosque .
the academy will most likely be shut down by the end of this year .
" it is my goal to close this school because we have indications that fundamental islamic doctrines are being conveyed in instruction and call for violence , " jürgen roters , the police commissioner in cologne , told german television ard .
the district authorities in cologne confiscated over 300 textbooks last week .
initial results were " alarming " , a spokeswoman said on thursday .
the authorities had asked an expert group at the regional institute for schools in soest to evaluate the teaching material .
the school , which is sponsored by saudi arabia , came under investigation earlier this year for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda . more briefs 23.10.2003 -pipe- court okays jewish claims in the former east germany 22.10.2003 -pipe- tougher air safety rules spark debate 22.10.2003 -pipe- german families love , but do they show it ? 22.10.2003 -pipe- the future of german energy policy outlined 22.10.2003 -pipe- germany to do more to fight aids 21.10.2003 -pipe- schröder defends eu constitution draft 21.10.2003 -pipe- extremists on trial for arson attacks 21.10.2003 -pipe- germany 's jewish population soars radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

thirty years ago , an employed german worked an average of 1,956 hours annually .
by 2002 , that number had fallen to 1,443 hours .
if measured through a standard eight-hour workday , german employees work 64 fewer days today than they did 33 years ago .
the reasons behind the drop are more vacation days , a shorter work week and a steady reduction in the amount of overtime employees put in , according to the figures released on thursday .
during the 1990s , the drop in hours worked per year was primarily due to increases in the number of people working part-time jobs , the harmonization of labor agreements in eastern and western germany after reunification as well as the general economic climate . more briefs 23.10.2003 -pipe- lufthansa wants to begin service to baghdad 23.10.2003 -pipe- germany reportedly seeks refund for toll delays 22.10.2003 -pipe- transport minister presents truck toll contract 22.10.2003 -pipe- warner music germany mulls berlin move 21.10.2003 -pipe- eu takes germany to court over can deposit law 21.10.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler posts third quarter losses 21.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut service personnel 21.10.2003 -pipe- minister rules out cancelling iraq debt radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

managers from china and germany met in berlin to discuss business opportunities .
german managers ' eyes flash euro signs ; their chinese colleagues praise german know-how . china 's economy is booming .
at 7 to 8 percent rates , the country 's growth has reached a level that economically stagnant germany can only dream of . but germany has a share in the growth too , as the country 's biggest european investor .
it injected € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- of the roughly € 53 billion -lrb- $ 62 billion -rrb- in foreign direct investments in china in 2002 .
last year it overtook japan as the most important asian country for german exports . " china is the most dynamic gravitation center in the southeast-asian area , " federation of german industries head michael rogowski said at a sino-german business conference sponsored by the magazine wirtschaftswoche on oct .
22-24 in berlin . the country has enormous potential for german companies .
" today china is the savior for many , " klaus grimm , the head of german industry and commerce -lrb- gic -rrb- in china , an organization aligned to the german chamber of commerce , told reuters .
around 2,000 german firms are active in china , according to grimm . cheap labor , many markets only the giants of german industry had dipped their toes into the chinese market until recently , mainly through joint ventures with chinese state firms .
then china started producing cheap products that were sold in the world 's richer countries , and the economic boom began .
now german small and medium-sized companies are also starting to discover china .
instead of making products to sell abroad , the germans are producing for the domestic market of 1.2 billion chinese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one result of opening to foreign trade companies too is that the quality of domestic producers has become noticeably better , " said hans-joachim körber , ceo of germany 's metro retail group .

its turnover has reached € 600 million -lrb- $ 706 million -rrb- in china , slightly more than 1 percent of the group 's entire yearly turnover .
the company plans to increase total asian turnover to 10 percent by 2010 . but metro has determined that china is not just one big market .
" china is a continent , " körber stressed .
he explained that metro had had to adjust to china 's size , which meant addressing numerous regional markets . german know-how for its part , china is keen on learning from germany , illustrated by the fact that 30,000 chinese are students at german universities . " germany has very competent producers , good products and very good engineering , " hong xing , the vice chairman of brilliance china automobile holding , said .
" and china needs all that .
we 're just getting started ...
but we have a large and growing market and cheap labor . " when german chancellor gerhard schröder visits china in nearly a month , the gic intended to announce it would open a fourth office - after shanghai , beijing and guangzhou - in the southwestern city of chengdu . but a clouds have moved in on the horizon : chinese authorities have refused to renew the gic 's business license in shanghai and grimm and his four german colleagues have lost their residence permits . the chinese were responding to a german media report alleging 50 german companies had complained that the gic was competing with them by offering legal , training and visa services to small and medium-sized companies .

german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis . despite their differences of opinion over some areas of drug law and legalization , germany and the netherlands , its more permissive , liberal neighbor , agreed on wednesday that the two countries would step up their collective efforts to fight the international drug trade and harmonize their narcotics laws . german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner met in berlin to hammer out the details of a german-dutch pact which would include initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of the police patrols on the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
“ we have patrol agreements with france and we operate similar ones with poland and the czech republic .
and it will be good when we also bring an equivalent agreement together with holland , ” schily said . the current amount of drugs crossing from the netherlands to germany show exactly how porous the border is . international smuggling one particular concern is the increase of drug smuggling coming into europe through amsterdam 's schiphol airport .
both ministers were particularly concerned about drug couriers who use international flights to transport narcotics from south america , for example , to europe . donner told reporters that at least 20 tons of cocaine were brought into europe each year through schiphol , the main dutch hub , where local police arrest 200 drug couriers every month .
“ that is a substantial share , at least ten percent of the whole european intake , ” he said . schily and donner showed a united front by saying that both countries were ready to put pressure on airlines to stem the problem , even suspending services between some cities on notorious drug routes . exchange of intelligence planned other measures , including the exchange of police records with the benelux countries - belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg - and other neighbors were being considered , said schily .
the german interior minister added that germany would send officials to the netherlands to help coordinate law enforcement efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the positive messages , the two ministers clashed over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter .
nearly 800 coffee shops across the country offer cannabis under government regulations that allow the sale of up to five grams of the drug to individual customers for their own consumption .
possession of more than 30 grams is illegal in the netherlands . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use . a dutch problem but donner said the cafes offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said . in a bid to placate his german counterpart , he did however present proposals that would , if agreed on , prevent drug tourism between the two countries by only allowing dutch residents to visit the nation 's infamous cannabis cafes . proposals target drug tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the plan , cannabis sales could in future be restricted by the introduction of a pass card or membership system and coffee shop customers might also be required to show their passports .
the minister added , however , that he did not intend to introduce the system himself . such a set of proposals would be welcomed by resident committees , especially those in the eastern town of venlo which sits on the german border .
the town has five official coffee shops and many illegal ones which serve german drug tourists heading the short distance over the border for a hit .
there are also plans to establish two shops nearer to the german border to reduce the nuisance factor for city center residents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.10.2003 -pipe- 15:00 utc germans work 25 percent less than in 1970 since 1970 , german employees have been steadily working less , according to the country 's federal statistical office .
thirty years ago , an employed german worked an average of 1,956 hours annually .
by 2002 , that number had fallen to 1,443 hours .

according to german restititution law , expropriation claims for property in the territory of the former east germany had to be made by the end of 1992 .
but since the jcc often did not have the necessary details for individual claims by that date , they filed global claims .
these included references to files or archives , which contained the information on individual cases .

a federal administrative court in leipzig ruled on thursday that global claims made by the jcc are valid .
however , they must include references from which a former jewish property owner can be determined at a later date .
according to german restititution law , expropriation claims for property in the territory of the former east germany had to be made by the end of 1992 .
but since the jcc often did not have the necessary details for individual claims by that date , they filed global claims .
these included references to files or archives , which contained the information on individual cases .
the concrete data was then supplied later .
the court ruling has now upheld this procedure . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- tougher air safety rules spark debate 22.10.2003 -pipe- german families love , but do they show it ? 22.10.2003 -pipe- the future of german energy policy outlined 22.10.2003 -pipe- germany to do more to fight aids 21.10.2003 -pipe- schröder defends eu constitution draft 21.10.2003 -pipe- extremists on trial for arson attacks 21.10.2003 -pipe- germany 's jewish population soars 21.10.2003 -pipe- bulgaria investigates german spy scandal radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the close , the nikkei share index had lost 554 points to 10,335 .
but the mood among investors remained relatively calm .
instead of reflecting any particularly acute crisis , the fall was mainly seen as a reaction against recent sharp gains in the nikkei , which hit a 16-month high at the beginning of this week .
" it 's part of a global reversal , " nikko salomon smith barney analyst alex kinmont told bbc world business report .
traders also worried that hi-tech shares could come under pressure if sony were to report poor results after the markets closed .
ups and downs in general , investors in japan are relatively buoyant at present .
there are increasing signs that the economy is starting to pull out of its decade-long recession .
" it 's very difficult for japan not to recover if the rest of the world recovers , " said mr kinmont .
but this very optimism has drawn significant flows of foreign money into japan 's capital markets , which has sparked a two-year surge in the value of the yen .
this has made conditions difficult for japanese exporters such as sony , whose performance is crucial to japan 's hopes of recovery .
japan has repeatedly intervened to push down the yen , but with little lasting effect , and its calls for global cooperation to realign exchange rates have gone unheeded .
' appropriate levels ' thursday 's sharp fall , which followed a drop on wall street on wednesday , was welcomed by some analysts .
" this is what the recently overheated japanese and us stock markets needed , " said mitsugu kanno of shinko securities .
" pricewise , the tokyo market appears to have come down to appropriate levels . "
the nikkei has risen by 27 % this year alone .

the video was released after some of the victims ' families complained evidence from the investigation into the killings had been kept from them .

klebold and harris shot dead 12 fellow students and a teacher on 20 april 1999 before killing themselves .
' bad things happen ' in the video , the teenagers are seen shooting at trees and bowling pins .
the teenagers had an array of weapons klebold , clad in a black trench coat he wore on the day of the killings , examines entry and exit holes in one of the pins .
" imagine that in someone 's -lsb- expletive -rsb- brain , " he says .
in one scene , klebold fires a sawn-off shotgun repeatedly from his hip ; in another , harris blows across the muzzle of a shotgun like a cowboy .
the teenagers laugh at wounds to their hands from the recoil from the high-power weapons .
a voice off camera is heard to say : " guns are bad ; when you saw them off and make them illegal , bad things happen . "
warning signs a copy of the film was turned over to police by mark manes , a friend of the teenagers , who was one of five people on the tape .
it was released by the jefferson county sheriff 's office at the urging of the district attorney 's office .
brian rohrbough , whose son , daniel , was among those killed at columbine high , had pushed for the tape 's release .
" in all of the school shootings across the country , there have always been tremendous red flags , " he said .
" on this tape , what they -lsb- klebold and harris -rsb- said they were going to do , they did . "
but heather wrabetz , a survivor of the shootings , said the film should not have been made public .
" showing this video of what they 're going to do to the school and to the students ...
i really just think it 's giving them more publicity that they do n't need , " she said .

speaking on the one-year anniversary of a moscow theatre siege by chechen separatists , the russian president said the base would strengthen regional security .
" that tragic event still hurts in our hearts and shows that terrorism is not an empty threat , " mr putin said .
" by creating an air shield here in kyrgyzstan , we intend to strengthen security in the region , whose stability has became a tangible factor affecting the development of the international situation , " he said .
the bbc 's moscow correspondent , damian grammaticus , says russia has chosen a highly strategic location for its first new foreign military base , reversing a decade of closures in places like cuba and vietnam .
the snow-capped tienshan mountains rise to the south ; beyond them is china .
afghanistan and pakistan are a short flight away .
russia says it wants to preserve stability in the region against threats like that posed by extremist islamic groups .
but many believe it also wants to counter the growing influence of the united states .
less than five minutes flying time from the russian base is manas airfield , which american aircraft have been using to support operations in afghanistan since shortly after the 11 september , 2001 , attacks .
the russian defence ministry has insisted that the us should only stay in the area until the situation in afghanistan stabilises .

the americans say they have had no direct talks with the russians about their new base and will leave issues like air traffic control up to the kyrgyz authorities .

we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by jacqueline stewart i 'm a single mum to joshua , 10 , and i 'm lucky enough to work and live in the same town , arbroath .
i work four days a week as a web designer for the local community college , angus college , which is about 1.5 miles away from my home .
joshua and i keep a close eye out for an approaching bus arbroath is n't blighted with the congestion problems of large towns and cities so my journey to work normally takes about 10 minutes in the car .
joshua goes to school outwith our local catchment area so i usually drop him off about five minutes ' walk from school then i continue on to my work , which is further up the same road .
however , this is the schools ' autumn break so he 's being looked after by my parents .
i 've often thought about dumping the car and taking public transport and / or walking to see if it was both more cost-effective and beneficial for our health .
in preparation for this week , i used the traveline scotland website to get the bus times , as my local bus company , strathtay scottish , does n't have any timetable information on its website .
day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one i 'm up at 0730 , about half an hour earlier than normal when i 'm taking the car .
first thing i do is turn on the tv to check the weather forecast which i never do - who needs it when they 're cosy inside their car ?
rain and gales predicted , which do n't fill me with hope for an easy week .
0825 leave the house and hot-foot it to the bus stop at the end of the road , where i discover i 've left my umbrella in the house .
thankfully it 's quite bright this morning .
the bus stops at a previous stop at 0826 .
no-one is in sight either at this stop or the one further up the road , which is a little worrying .
i panic , thinking we 've missed the bus .
0830 i spot people at the stop ahead of us waiting and breathe a sigh of relief .
still no sign of the bus though .
0832 bus finally turns up .
as i 've no idea how much it costs , i ask how much a ticket to keptie pond will be .
it 's 70p for me and 50p for joshua .
i think the last time i was on a bus an adult fare was 55p .
i try to pay using a £ 2 coin but the driver has no change .
thankfully after rooting around in my purse , i have the correct change .
0840 i 'm slightly worried as we 're still up at horologe hill and nowhere near my work .
i start at 0845 however , this time is slightly flexible .
0845 the bus arrives at the bus station - a conductor gets on .
0850 we arrive at our stop at keptie pond .
i say goodbye to joshua and he continues his journey on foot to my parents ' house about 10 minutes walk up the road .
i start the short walk to work .
0855 get into my office , 10 minutes late .
not a good start to the week .
1700 look out the window , sky is very grey and it looks like rain .
not relishing the 10 minute walk up to my parents to collect joshua .
1705 make my way out , as it starts to spit .
turn down the kind offer of a lift from a colleague -lrb- if i 'm going to do this , i 'm going to do it right -rrb- and start walking with another colleague up keptie road .
1712 the heavens open .
1720 arrive soaking wet at my parents ' house .
1755 joshua and i leave my parents ' house -lrb- after i spend half an hour drying my jeans in the tumble dryer -rrb- .
1803 arrive at bus stop in cairnie road .
bus due at 1811 .
1811 two buses pass .
neither is ours .
1815 number 45 finally makes an appearance .
1833 arrive at cliffburn road bus stop and we start walking home .
1835 finally in house .
it 's taken an hour-and-a-half to get home tonight and we 're hungry .
not impressed with the first day of using public transport and seriously considering giving up and taking the car tomorrow .
day two leave the house at 0822 and walk to the bus stop before the one we waited at yesterday - the distance is the same .
i 'm well prepared today - i have my umbrella .
we enjoyed the views from the bus 0824 arrive at the stop opposite the cliffburn hotel 0825 two other women arrive to get on the bus too - one strikes up a brief conversation with me .
i do n't usually get that in the car -lrb- unless you count joshua -rrb- .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 arrive at main bus station .
making better time today .
it could be because there 's a conductor on board who is taking fares , freeing up the driver 's time .
0846 leave bus station and head towards keptie road .
0850 get off at keptie pond again .
i walk down to work whilst joshua heads up to my parents ' house 0855 arrive at the office .
10 minutes late again .
1700 leave work - joshua is waiting for me outside .
1705 arrive at bus stop .
however , since the bus is not due until 1717 , we decide to keep warm by walking down to the bus station .
1713 arrive at bus station .
check timetable to see which bus we need - it 's number 73 .
1715 number 73 arrives at station .
i 'm surprised it 's early .
we hop on and go upstairs .
1719 shock starts to set in as i realise we 're on the wrong bus .
it 's turned in the opposite direction of where we should be going .
1720 after explaining to the conductor that we 're on the wrong bus -lrb- the 73a to dundee -rrb- , we get off at the train station and walk quickly back to the bus station .
1721 our bus , the " proper " 73 , passes us as we head down the road .
we decide to catch it at lordburn , the next stop after the bus station .
1723 our bus arrives - hooray ! 1727 no further troubles .
we get off at the cliffburn hotel and start walking towards our house .
1730 arrive home .
day three this is my day off and as the remit was only for the commute to work , i rejoice in taking the car two miles to the nearest diy store -lrb- on the outer edge of the other side of town -rrb- .
we have to stock up on sawdust for our guinea pigs and i usually get the ultra-massive size to save me buying it so often .
joshua and i can barely lift it between us so imagining how we 'd get it home on the bus does n't bear thinking about .
day four i wake at 0750 .
late !
leave the house and walk quickly to the bus stop at the end of our street .
parking spaces at my work are very hard to come by 0827 reach the end of the road in time to see our bus drive past .
0828 stop cursing inwardly and decide to try to head the bus off at horologe hill as it still has to circle round some of cliffburn and hayshead areas of arbroath .
we part run / jog / walk up st ninians road and along seaton road then up the short distance to the bus stop in horologe hill .
0833 arrive at the stop as the bus arrives .
phew ! 0840 get to the bus station where the bus sits for six minutes which gives me time to compose myself .
0848 alight at keptie pond and i say goodbye to joshua as he continues to my parents ' house .
arrange to meet him at 1650 outside my work today in the hope that we can catch the 1656 bus and get home slightly earlier .
0853 arrive in the office - only eight minutes late today .
1650 meet joshua outside work 1656 reach the bus stop .
no buses have passed us on the way down and there 's no sign of the number 45 .
there 's no timetable information attached to the stop so i ca n't even see if there was supposed to be a 1656 bus at all ! 1703 still no sign .
joshua walks up the street to look round the corner and while there , another bus is coming down the other street in our direction .
shout for him to get back but i need n't have bother .
the bus is n't ours and is heading in a different direction .
1707 joshua 's fed up so i suggest walking down to the next stop at the train station to use up some time .
1709 arrive at the bus stop as it 's the one with a shelter and seats -lrb- or rather a flat rail -rrb- .
the timetable confirms a number 73 is due at 1717 .
1717 the bus arrives , on time too .
this is a double-decker so we head upstairs and wait for the conductor to collect our money .
1726 arrive at the cliffburn road stop on time .
the conductor still has n't taken our money so i ask him before we get off it he wants it .
he 's deep in conversation with the bus driver about changing the numbers / destinations on the front of the bus so mumbles that it 's all right and waves me off .
i 've travelled for free tonight which sort of makes up for the lack of the earlier bus .
1729 arrive home .
day five to make up for yesterday 's fiasco with missing the bus , i make sure we leave the house early this morning , just in case .
0823 arrive at the bus stop .
no-one else here .
joshua spots a robin fighting with another bird in the garden next to the bus stop .
we would n't see things like that in the car .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 an uneventful journey so far - everything 's going smoothly as we arrive at the bus station .
0848 bus arrives at keptie pond .
joshua and i say our goodbyes .
i arrange to meet him at 1630 as my work closes earlier on a friday during the holidays .
0853 arrive in the office .
1630 walk with joshua the short distance to the keptie street bus stop .
1632 arrive at the stop and joshua starts badgering me to walk to the next stop .
however , after tuesday 's fiasco with the bus passing by us as we walked down , i insist that we stay put .
1638 bus arrives on time .
joshua 's disappointed because it 's only a single decker , not a double-decker .
1646 arrive at cliffburn road and start walking .
1649 in the house .
no problems today and it 's all run like clockwork .
a nice , straightforward end to the week 's experiment .
verdict the journeys to work and back have taken on average 15 minutes longer each way -lrb- when things went to plan -rrb- .
this week , taking into account my saved fare on thursday , i 've spent £ 8.40 .
it should have been £ 9.60 .
had i purchased a weekly ticket , the cost should have been less .
my petrol costs for running my peugeot 106 1.4 on a typical week are less than £ 5 .
however , if you add in my costs of keeping the car on the road ; £ 105 for road tax , £ 200 for insurance and £ 150 approx in maintenance a year , this works out at an extra £ 8.75 per week , which means i would be cheaper getting the bus .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
this has not been a typical work week as joshua has been off school for the holidays .
on a normal week , i collect him from my parents ' house on a monday or tuesday .
on thursdays and friday 's , he goes to an after-school club , which is based in his school , so i would have to collect him from there -lrb- about 10 minutes walk from my work -rrb- .
it would be hit or miss on the days he goes to the after-school club whether or not we could catch the 1720 from the bus station , about six minutes walk along the road .
if not , we would have option of either waiting for the next bus at 1740 or walking up the road -lrb- about 20 minutes -rrb- .
it 's certainly been an eye-opening experiment .
i 've learnt that i have to be organised in order to make public transport work .
apart from monday -lrb- when i got soaked -rrb- , i 've enjoyed the walk to and from the bus stops .
on the whole , it 's been pretty good week for weather , but if i had to walk then wait in the freezing cold and / or rain every day of the week , then i think i would very quickly lose the will to take public transport .
upstairs ' novelty ' apart from one occasion when the bus did n't turn up , the buses are fairly reliable , clean and cost-effective and joshua has enjoyed the novelty of being upstairs on a double-decker and seeing things he would n't normally see in the car .
it 's also been a bonus not having to fight for a parking space at work .
because of construction work on angus college 's new community access and learning centre , and other building works , spaces in the car park and on keptie road , where i normally park , are at a premium .
additionally , i 've found that i 've taken more exercise at lunchtimes too .
normally , on my 45 minute lunch break , i nip home in the car to do a little bit of housework .
however , as it would take too long to walk there and back , i 've spent my lunch breaks walking down to the local shops to buy a roll which definitely made me more refreshed for the afternoon .
i 'll definitely do more walking in future , during my lunch breaks .
lack of information my main bugbear from this week , is the lack of timetable information .
not all the stops have timetables , so for public transport novices like myself , unless we looked up the traveline scotland website in advance , we would have no idea of when the bus was due , or even if it was the right bus for us .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
although i could probably live with commuting purely by public transport or by walking , other lifestyle factors , such as getting the shopping and visiting friends and family would be made more time-consuming and difficult .
having my car gives me more choices - it influences where i choose live , where i can work , where i send my son to school , where i can shop and much more etc .
therefore , i ca n't see me giving up my car any time soon .

joshua and i can barely lift it between us so imagining how we 'd get it home on the bus does n't bear thinking about .
day four i wake at 0750 .
late !
leave the house and walk quickly to the bus stop at the end of our street .
parking spaces at my work are very hard to come by 0827 reach the end of the road in time to see our bus drive past .
0828 stop cursing inwardly and decide to try to head the bus off at horologe hill as it still has to circle round some of cliffburn and hayshead areas of arbroath .
we part run / jog / walk up st ninians road and along seaton road then up the short distance to the bus stop in horologe hill .
0833 arrive at the stop as the bus arrives .
phew ! 0840 get to the bus station where the bus sits for six minutes which gives me time to compose myself .
0848 alight at keptie pond and i say goodbye to joshua as he continues to my parents ' house .
arrange to meet him at 1650 outside my work today in the hope that we can catch the 1656 bus and get home slightly earlier .
0853 arrive in the office - only eight minutes late today .
1650 meet joshua outside work 1656 reach the bus stop .
no buses have passed us on the way down and there 's no sign of the number 45 .
there 's no timetable information attached to the stop so i ca n't even see if there was supposed to be a 1656 bus at all ! 1703 still no sign .
joshua walks up the street to look round the corner and while there , another bus is coming down the other street in our direction .
shout for him to get back but i need n't have bother .
the bus is n't ours and is heading in a different direction .
1707 joshua 's fed up so i suggest walking down to the next stop at the train station to use up some time .
1709 arrive at the bus stop as it 's the one with a shelter and seats -lrb- or rather a flat rail -rrb- .
the timetable confirms a number 73 is due at 1717 .
1717 the bus arrives , on time too .
this is a double-decker so we head upstairs and wait for the conductor to collect our money .
1726 arrive at the cliffburn road stop on time .
the conductor still has n't taken our money so i ask him before we get off it he wants it .
he 's deep in conversation with the bus driver about changing the numbers / destinations on the front of the bus so mumbles that it 's all right and waves me off .
i 've travelled for free tonight which sort of makes up for the lack of the earlier bus .
1729 arrive home .
day five to make up for yesterday 's fiasco with missing the bus , i make sure we leave the house early this morning , just in case .
0823 arrive at the bus stop .
no-one else here .
joshua spots a robin fighting with another bird in the garden next to the bus stop .
we would n't see things like that in the car .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 an uneventful journey so far - everything 's going smoothly as we arrive at the bus station .
0848 bus arrives at keptie pond .
joshua and i say our goodbyes .
i arrange to meet him at 1630 as my work closes earlier on a friday during the holidays .
0853 arrive in the office .
1630 walk with joshua the short distance to the keptie street bus stop .
1632 arrive at the stop and joshua starts badgering me to walk to the next stop .
however , after tuesday 's fiasco with the bus passing by us as we walked down , i insist that we stay put .
1638 bus arrives on time .
joshua 's disappointed because it 's only a single decker , not a double-decker .
1646 arrive at cliffburn road and start walking .
1649 in the house .
no problems today and it 's all run like clockwork .
a nice , straightforward end to the week 's experiment .
verdict the journeys to work and back have taken on average 15 minutes longer each way -lrb- when things went to plan -rrb- .
this week , taking into account my saved fare on thursday , i 've spent £ 8.40 .
it should have been £ 9.60 .
had i purchased a weekly ticket , the cost should have been less .
my petrol costs for running my peugeot 106 1.4 on a typical week are less than £ 5 .
however , if you add in my costs of keeping the car on the road ; £ 105 for road tax , £ 200 for insurance and £ 150 approx in maintenance a year , this works out at an extra £ 8.75 per week , which means i would be cheaper getting the bus .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
this has not been a typical work week as joshua has been off school for the holidays .
on a normal week , i collect him from my parents ' house on a monday or tuesday .
on thursdays and friday 's , he goes to an after-school club , which is based in his school , so i would have to collect him from there -lrb- about 10 minutes walk from my work -rrb- .
it would be hit or miss on the days he goes to the after-school club whether or not we could catch the 1720 from the bus station , about six minutes walk along the road .
if not , we would have option of either waiting for the next bus at 1740 or walking up the road -lrb- about 20 minutes -rrb- .
it 's certainly been an eye-opening experiment .
i 've learnt that i have to be organised in order to make public transport work .
apart from monday -lrb- when i got soaked -rrb- , i 've enjoyed the walk to and from the bus stops .
on the whole , it 's been pretty good week for weather , but if i had to walk then wait in the freezing cold and / or rain every day of the week , then i think i would very quickly lose the will to take public transport .
upstairs ' novelty ' apart from one occasion when the bus did n't turn up , the buses are fairly reliable , clean and cost-effective and joshua has enjoyed the novelty of being upstairs on a double-decker and seeing things he would n't normally see in the car .
it 's also been a bonus not having to fight for a parking space at work .
because of construction work on angus college 's new community access and learning centre , and other building works , spaces in the car park and on keptie road , where i normally park , are at a premium .
additionally , i 've found that i 've taken more exercise at lunchtimes too .
normally , on my 45 minute lunch break , i nip home in the car to do a little bit of housework .
however , as it would take too long to walk there and back , i 've spent my lunch breaks walking down to the local shops to buy a roll which definitely made me more refreshed for the afternoon .
i 'll definitely do more walking in future , during my lunch breaks .
lack of information my main bugbear from this week , is the lack of timetable information .
not all the stops have timetables , so for public transport novices like myself , unless we looked up the traveline scotland website in advance , we would have no idea of when the bus was due , or even if it was the right bus for us .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
although i could probably live with commuting purely by public transport or by walking , other lifestyle factors , such as getting the shopping and visiting friends and family would be made more time-consuming and difficult .
having my car gives me more choices - it influences where i choose live , where i can work , where i send my son to school , where i can shop and much more etc .
therefore , i ca n't see me giving up my car any time soon .

we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by jacqueline stewart i 'm a single mum to joshua , 10 , and i 'm lucky enough to work and live in the same town , arbroath .
i work four days a week as a web designer for the local community college , angus college , which is about 1.5 miles away from my home .
joshua and i keep a close eye out for an approaching bus arbroath is n't blighted with the congestion problems of large towns and cities so my journey to work normally takes about 10 minutes in the car .
joshua goes to school outwith our local catchment area so i usually drop him off about five minutes ' walk from school then i continue on to my work , which is further up the same road .
however , this is the schools ' autumn break so he 's being looked after by my parents .
i 've often thought about dumping the car and taking public transport and / or walking to see if it was both more cost-effective and beneficial for our health .
in preparation for this week , i used the traveline scotland website to get the bus times , as my local bus company , strathtay scottish , does n't have any timetable information on its website .
day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one i 'm up at 0730 , about half an hour earlier than normal when i 'm taking the car .
first thing i do is turn on the tv to check the weather forecast which i never do - who needs it when they 're cosy inside their car ?
rain and gales predicted , which do n't fill me with hope for an easy week .
0825 leave the house and hot-foot it to the bus stop at the end of the road , where i discover i 've left my umbrella in the house .
thankfully it 's quite bright this morning .
the bus stops at a previous stop at 0826 .
no-one is in sight either at this stop or the one further up the road , which is a little worrying .
i panic , thinking we 've missed the bus .
0830 i spot people at the stop ahead of us waiting and breathe a sigh of relief .
still no sign of the bus though .
0832 bus finally turns up .
as i 've no idea how much it costs , i ask how much a ticket to keptie pond will be .
it 's 70p for me and 50p for joshua .
i think the last time i was on a bus an adult fare was 55p .
i try to pay using a £ 2 coin but the driver has no change .
thankfully after rooting around in my purse , i have the correct change .
0840 i 'm slightly worried as we 're still up at horologe hill and nowhere near my work .
i start at 0845 however , this time is slightly flexible .
0845 the bus arrives at the bus station - a conductor gets on .
0850 we arrive at our stop at keptie pond .
i say goodbye to joshua and he continues his journey on foot to my parents ' house about 10 minutes walk up the road .
i start the short walk to work .
0855 get into my office , 10 minutes late .
not a good start to the week .
1700 look out the window , sky is very grey and it looks like rain .
not relishing the 10 minute walk up to my parents to collect joshua .
1705 make my way out , as it starts to spit .
turn down the kind offer of a lift from a colleague -lrb- if i 'm going to do this , i 'm going to do it right -rrb- and start walking with another colleague up keptie road .
1712 the heavens open .
1720 arrive soaking wet at my parents ' house .
1755 joshua and i leave my parents ' house -lrb- after i spend half an hour drying my jeans in the tumble dryer -rrb- .
1803 arrive at bus stop in cairnie road .
bus due at 1811 .
1811 two buses pass .
neither is ours .
1815 number 45 finally makes an appearance .
1833 arrive at cliffburn road bus stop and we start walking home .
1835 finally in house .
it 's taken an hour-and-a-half to get home tonight and we 're hungry .
not impressed with the first day of using public transport and seriously considering giving up and taking the car tomorrow .
day two leave the house at 0822 and walk to the bus stop before the one we waited at yesterday - the distance is the same .
i 'm well prepared today - i have my umbrella .
we enjoyed the views from the bus 0824 arrive at the stop opposite the cliffburn hotel 0825 two other women arrive to get on the bus too - one strikes up a brief conversation with me .
i do n't usually get that in the car -lrb- unless you count joshua -rrb- .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 arrive at main bus station .
making better time today .
it could be because there 's a conductor on board who is taking fares , freeing up the driver 's time .
0846 leave bus station and head towards keptie road .
0850 get off at keptie pond again .
i walk down to work whilst joshua heads up to my parents ' house 0855 arrive at the office .
10 minutes late again .
1700 leave work - joshua is waiting for me outside .
1705 arrive at bus stop .
however , since the bus is not due until 1717 , we decide to keep warm by walking down to the bus station .
1713 arrive at bus station .
check timetable to see which bus we need - it 's number 73 .
1715 number 73 arrives at station .
i 'm surprised it 's early .
we hop on and go upstairs .
1719 shock starts to set in as i realise we 're on the wrong bus .
it 's turned in the opposite direction of where we should be going .
1720 after explaining to the conductor that we 're on the wrong bus -lrb- the 73a to dundee -rrb- , we get off at the train station and walk quickly back to the bus station .
1721 our bus , the " proper " 73 , passes us as we head down the road .
we decide to catch it at lordburn , the next stop after the bus station .
1723 our bus arrives - hooray ! 1727 no further troubles .
we get off at the cliffburn hotel and start walking towards our house .
1730 arrive home .
day three this is my day off and as the remit was only for the commute to work , i rejoice in taking the car two miles to the nearest diy store -lrb- on the outer edge of the other side of town -rrb- .
we have to stock up on sawdust for our guinea pigs and i usually get the ultra-massive size to save me buying it so often .

however , since the bus is not due until 1717 , we decide to keep warm by walking down to the bus station .
1713 arrive at bus station .
check timetable to see which bus we need - it 's number 73 .
1715 number 73 arrives at station .
i 'm surprised it 's early .
we hop on and go upstairs .
1719 shock starts to set in as i realise we 're on the wrong bus .
it 's turned in the opposite direction of where we should be going .
1720 after explaining to the conductor that we 're on the wrong bus -lrb- the 73a to dundee -rrb- , we get off at the train station and walk quickly back to the bus station .
1721 our bus , the " proper " 73 , passes us as we head down the road .
we decide to catch it at lordburn , the next stop after the bus station .
1723 our bus arrives - hooray ! 1727 no further troubles .
we get off at the cliffburn hotel and start walking towards our house .
1730 arrive home .
day three this is my day off and as the remit was only for the commute to work , i rejoice in taking the car two miles to the nearest diy store -lrb- on the outer edge of the other side of town -rrb- .
we have to stock up on sawdust for our guinea pigs and i usually get the ultra-massive size to save me buying it so often .
joshua and i can barely lift it between us so imagining how we 'd get it home on the bus does n't bear thinking about .
day four i wake at 0750 .
late !
leave the house and walk quickly to the bus stop at the end of our street .
parking spaces at my work are very hard to come by 0827 reach the end of the road in time to see our bus drive past .
0828 stop cursing inwardly and decide to try to head the bus off at horologe hill as it still has to circle round some of cliffburn and hayshead areas of arbroath .
we part run / jog / walk up st ninians road and along seaton road then up the short distance to the bus stop in horologe hill .
0833 arrive at the stop as the bus arrives .
phew ! 0840 get to the bus station where the bus sits for six minutes which gives me time to compose myself .
0848 alight at keptie pond and i say goodbye to joshua as he continues to my parents ' house .
arrange to meet him at 1650 outside my work today in the hope that we can catch the 1656 bus and get home slightly earlier .
0853 arrive in the office - only eight minutes late today .
1650 meet joshua outside work 1656 reach the bus stop .
no buses have passed us on the way down and there 's no sign of the number 45 .
there 's no timetable information attached to the stop so i ca n't even see if there was supposed to be a 1656 bus at all ! 1703 still no sign .
joshua walks up the street to look round the corner and while there , another bus is coming down the other street in our direction .
shout for him to get back but i need n't have bother .
the bus is n't ours and is heading in a different direction .
1707 joshua 's fed up so i suggest walking down to the next stop at the train station to use up some time .
1709 arrive at the bus stop as it 's the one with a shelter and seats -lrb- or rather a flat rail -rrb- .
the timetable confirms a number 73 is due at 1717 .
1717 the bus arrives , on time too .
this is a double-decker so we head upstairs and wait for the conductor to collect our money .
1726 arrive at the cliffburn road stop on time .
the conductor still has n't taken our money so i ask him before we get off it he wants it .
he 's deep in conversation with the bus driver about changing the numbers / destinations on the front of the bus so mumbles that it 's all right and waves me off .
i 've travelled for free tonight which sort of makes up for the lack of the earlier bus .
1729 arrive home .
day five to make up for yesterday 's fiasco with missing the bus , i make sure we leave the house early this morning , just in case .
0823 arrive at the bus stop .
no-one else here .
joshua spots a robin fighting with another bird in the garden next to the bus stop .
we would n't see things like that in the car .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 an uneventful journey so far - everything 's going smoothly as we arrive at the bus station .
0848 bus arrives at keptie pond .
joshua and i say our goodbyes .
i arrange to meet him at 1630 as my work closes earlier on a friday during the holidays .
0853 arrive in the office .
1630 walk with joshua the short distance to the keptie street bus stop .
1632 arrive at the stop and joshua starts badgering me to walk to the next stop .
however , after tuesday 's fiasco with the bus passing by us as we walked down , i insist that we stay put .
1638 bus arrives on time .
joshua 's disappointed because it 's only a single decker , not a double-decker .
1646 arrive at cliffburn road and start walking .
1649 in the house .
no problems today and it 's all run like clockwork .
a nice , straightforward end to the week 's experiment .
verdict the journeys to work and back have taken on average 15 minutes longer each way -lrb- when things went to plan -rrb- .
this week , taking into account my saved fare on thursday , i 've spent £ 8.40 .
it should have been £ 9.60 .
had i purchased a weekly ticket , the cost should have been less .
my petrol costs for running my peugeot 106 1.4 on a typical week are less than £ 5 .
however , if you add in my costs of keeping the car on the road ; £ 105 for road tax , £ 200 for insurance and £ 150 approx in maintenance a year , this works out at an extra £ 8.75 per week , which means i would be cheaper getting the bus .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
this has not been a typical work week as joshua has been off school for the holidays .
on a normal week , i collect him from my parents ' house on a monday or tuesday .
on thursdays and friday 's , he goes to an after-school club , which is based in his school , so i would have to collect him from there -lrb- about 10 minutes walk from my work -rrb- .
it would be hit or miss on the days he goes to the after-school club whether or not we could catch the 1720 from the bus station , about six minutes walk along the road .
if not , we would have option of either waiting for the next bus at 1740 or walking up the road -lrb- about 20 minutes -rrb- .
it 's certainly been an eye-opening experiment .
i 've learnt that i have to be organised in order to make public transport work .
apart from monday -lrb- when i got soaked -rrb- , i 've enjoyed the walk to and from the bus stops .
on the whole , it 's been pretty good week for weather , but if i had to walk then wait in the freezing cold and / or rain every day of the week , then i think i would very quickly lose the will to take public transport .
upstairs ' novelty ' apart from one occasion when the bus did n't turn up , the buses are fairly reliable , clean and cost-effective and joshua has enjoyed the novelty of being upstairs on a double-decker and seeing things he would n't normally see in the car .
it 's also been a bonus not having to fight for a parking space at work .
because of construction work on angus college 's new community access and learning centre , and other building works , spaces in the car park and on keptie road , where i normally park , are at a premium .
additionally , i 've found that i 've taken more exercise at lunchtimes too .
normally , on my 45 minute lunch break , i nip home in the car to do a little bit of housework .
however , as it would take too long to walk there and back , i 've spent my lunch breaks walking down to the local shops to buy a roll which definitely made me more refreshed for the afternoon .
i 'll definitely do more walking in future , during my lunch breaks .
lack of information my main bugbear from this week , is the lack of timetable information .
not all the stops have timetables , so for public transport novices like myself , unless we looked up the traveline scotland website in advance , we would have no idea of when the bus was due , or even if it was the right bus for us .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
although i could probably live with commuting purely by public transport or by walking , other lifestyle factors , such as getting the shopping and visiting friends and family would be made more time-consuming and difficult .
having my car gives me more choices - it influences where i choose live , where i can work , where i send my son to school , where i can shop and much more etc .
therefore , i ca n't see me giving up my car any time soon .

we asked for volunteers to use the executive 's " choose another way " website and plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by jacqueline stewart i 'm a single mum to joshua , 10 , and i 'm lucky enough to work and live in the same town , arbroath .
i work four days a week as a web designer for the local community college , angus college , which is about 1.5 miles away from my home .
joshua and i keep a close eye out for an approaching bus arbroath is n't blighted with the congestion problems of large towns and cities so my journey to work normally takes about 10 minutes in the car .
joshua goes to school outwith our local catchment area so i usually drop him off about five minutes ' walk from school then i continue on to my work , which is further up the same road .
however , this is the schools ' autumn break so he 's being looked after by my parents .
i 've often thought about dumping the car and taking public transport and / or walking to see if it was both more cost-effective and beneficial for our health .
in preparation for this week , i used the traveline scotland website to get the bus times , as my local bus company , strathtay scottish , does n't have any timetable information on its website .
day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one i 'm up at 0730 , about half an hour earlier than normal when i 'm taking the car .
first thing i do is turn on the tv to check the weather forecast which i never do - who needs it when they 're cosy inside their car ?
rain and gales predicted , which do n't fill me with hope for an easy week .
0825 leave the house and hot-foot it to the bus stop at the end of the road , where i discover i 've left my umbrella in the house .
thankfully it 's quite bright this morning .
the bus stops at a previous stop at 0826 .
no-one is in sight either at this stop or the one further up the road , which is a little worrying .
i panic , thinking we 've missed the bus .
0830 i spot people at the stop ahead of us waiting and breathe a sigh of relief .
still no sign of the bus though .
0832 bus finally turns up .
as i 've no idea how much it costs , i ask how much a ticket to keptie pond will be .
it 's 70p for me and 50p for joshua .
i think the last time i was on a bus an adult fare was 55p .
i try to pay using a £ 2 coin but the driver has no change .
thankfully after rooting around in my purse , i have the correct change .
0840 i 'm slightly worried as we 're still up at horologe hill and nowhere near my work .
i start at 0845 however , this time is slightly flexible .
0845 the bus arrives at the bus station - a conductor gets on .
0850 we arrive at our stop at keptie pond .
i say goodbye to joshua and he continues his journey on foot to my parents ' house about 10 minutes walk up the road .
i start the short walk to work .
0855 get into my office , 10 minutes late .
not a good start to the week .
1700 look out the window , sky is very grey and it looks like rain .
not relishing the 10 minute walk up to my parents to collect joshua .
1705 make my way out , as it starts to spit .
turn down the kind offer of a lift from a colleague -lrb- if i 'm going to do this , i 'm going to do it right -rrb- and start walking with another colleague up keptie road .
1712 the heavens open .
1720 arrive soaking wet at my parents ' house .
1755 joshua and i leave my parents ' house -lrb- after i spend half an hour drying my jeans in the tumble dryer -rrb- .

1811 two buses pass .
neither is ours .
1815 number 45 finally makes an appearance .
1833 arrive at cliffburn road bus stop and we start walking home .
1835 finally in house .
it 's taken an hour-and-a-half to get home tonight and we 're hungry .
not impressed with the first day of using public transport and seriously considering giving up and taking the car tomorrow .
day two leave the house at 0822 and walk to the bus stop before the one we waited at yesterday - the distance is the same .
i 'm well prepared today - i have my umbrella .
we enjoyed the views from the bus 0824 arrive at the stop opposite the cliffburn hotel 0825 two other women arrive to get on the bus too - one strikes up a brief conversation with me .
i do n't usually get that in the car -lrb- unless you count joshua -rrb- .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 arrive at main bus station .
making better time today .
it could be because there 's a conductor on board who is taking fares , freeing up the driver 's time .
0846 leave bus station and head towards keptie road .
0850 get off at keptie pond again .
i walk down to work whilst joshua heads up to my parents ' house 0855 arrive at the office .

not impressed with the first day of using public transport and seriously considering giving up and taking the car tomorrow .
day two leave the house at 0822 and walk to the bus stop before the one we waited at yesterday - the distance is the same .
i 'm well prepared today - i have my umbrella .
we enjoyed the views from the bus 0824 arrive at the stop opposite the cliffburn hotel 0825 two other women arrive to get on the bus too - one strikes up a brief conversation with me .
i do n't usually get that in the car -lrb- unless you count joshua -rrb- .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 arrive at main bus station .
making better time today .
it could be because there 's a conductor on board who is taking fares , freeing up the driver 's time .
0846 leave bus station and head towards keptie road .
0850 get off at keptie pond again .
i walk down to work whilst joshua heads up to my parents ' house 0855 arrive at the office .
10 minutes late again .
1700 leave work - joshua is waiting for me outside .
1705 arrive at bus stop .
however , since the bus is not due until 1717 , we decide to keep warm by walking down to the bus station .
1713 arrive at bus station .
check timetable to see which bus we need - it 's number 73 .
1715 number 73 arrives at station .
i 'm surprised it 's early .
we hop on and go upstairs .
1719 shock starts to set in as i realise we 're on the wrong bus .
it 's turned in the opposite direction of where we should be going .
1720 after explaining to the conductor that we 're on the wrong bus -lrb- the 73a to dundee -rrb- , we get off at the train station and walk quickly back to the bus station .
1721 our bus , the " proper " 73 , passes us as we head down the road .
we decide to catch it at lordburn , the next stop after the bus station .
1723 our bus arrives - hooray ! 1727 no further troubles .
we get off at the cliffburn hotel and start walking towards our house .
1730 arrive home .
day three this is my day off and as the remit was only for the commute to work , i rejoice in taking the car two miles to the nearest diy store -lrb- on the outer edge of the other side of town -rrb- .
we have to stock up on sawdust for our guinea pigs and i usually get the ultra-massive size to save me buying it so often .
joshua and i can barely lift it between us so imagining how we 'd get it home on the bus does n't bear thinking about .
day four i wake at 0750 .
late !
leave the house and walk quickly to the bus stop at the end of our street .
parking spaces at my work are very hard to come by 0827 reach the end of the road in time to see our bus drive past .
0828 stop cursing inwardly and decide to try to head the bus off at horologe hill as it still has to circle round some of cliffburn and hayshead areas of arbroath .
we part run / jog / walk up st ninians road and along seaton road then up the short distance to the bus stop in horologe hill .
0833 arrive at the stop as the bus arrives .
phew ! 0840 get to the bus station where the bus sits for six minutes which gives me time to compose myself .
0848 alight at keptie pond and i say goodbye to joshua as he continues to my parents ' house .
arrange to meet him at 1650 outside my work today in the hope that we can catch the 1656 bus and get home slightly earlier .
0853 arrive in the office - only eight minutes late today .
1650 meet joshua outside work 1656 reach the bus stop .
no buses have passed us on the way down and there 's no sign of the number 45 .
there 's no timetable information attached to the stop so i ca n't even see if there was supposed to be a 1656 bus at all ! 1703 still no sign .
joshua walks up the street to look round the corner and while there , another bus is coming down the other street in our direction .
shout for him to get back but i need n't have bother .
the bus is n't ours and is heading in a different direction .
1707 joshua 's fed up so i suggest walking down to the next stop at the train station to use up some time .
1709 arrive at the bus stop as it 's the one with a shelter and seats -lrb- or rather a flat rail -rrb- .
the timetable confirms a number 73 is due at 1717 .
1717 the bus arrives , on time too .
this is a double-decker so we head upstairs and wait for the conductor to collect our money .
1726 arrive at the cliffburn road stop on time .
the conductor still has n't taken our money so i ask him before we get off it he wants it .
he 's deep in conversation with the bus driver about changing the numbers / destinations on the front of the bus so mumbles that it 's all right and waves me off .
i 've travelled for free tonight which sort of makes up for the lack of the earlier bus .
1729 arrive home .
day five to make up for yesterday 's fiasco with missing the bus , i make sure we leave the house early this morning , just in case .
0823 arrive at the bus stop .
no-one else here .
joshua spots a robin fighting with another bird in the garden next to the bus stop .
we would n't see things like that in the car .
0826 bus arrives on time .
0840 an uneventful journey so far - everything 's going smoothly as we arrive at the bus station .
0848 bus arrives at keptie pond .
joshua and i say our goodbyes .
i arrange to meet him at 1630 as my work closes earlier on a friday during the holidays .
0853 arrive in the office .
1630 walk with joshua the short distance to the keptie street bus stop .
1632 arrive at the stop and joshua starts badgering me to walk to the next stop .
however , after tuesday 's fiasco with the bus passing by us as we walked down , i insist that we stay put .
1638 bus arrives on time .
joshua 's disappointed because it 's only a single decker , not a double-decker .
1646 arrive at cliffburn road and start walking .
1649 in the house .
no problems today and it 's all run like clockwork .
a nice , straightforward end to the week 's experiment .
verdict the journeys to work and back have taken on average 15 minutes longer each way -lrb- when things went to plan -rrb- .
this week , taking into account my saved fare on thursday , i 've spent £ 8.40 .
it should have been £ 9.60 .
had i purchased a weekly ticket , the cost should have been less .
my petrol costs for running my peugeot 106 1.4 on a typical week are less than £ 5 .
however , if you add in my costs of keeping the car on the road ; £ 105 for road tax , £ 200 for insurance and £ 150 approx in maintenance a year , this works out at an extra £ 8.75 per week , which means i would be cheaper getting the bus .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
this has not been a typical work week as joshua has been off school for the holidays .
on a normal week , i collect him from my parents ' house on a monday or tuesday .
on thursdays and friday 's , he goes to an after-school club , which is based in his school , so i would have to collect him from there -lrb- about 10 minutes walk from my work -rrb- .
it would be hit or miss on the days he goes to the after-school club whether or not we could catch the 1720 from the bus station , about six minutes walk along the road .
if not , we would have option of either waiting for the next bus at 1740 or walking up the road -lrb- about 20 minutes -rrb- .
it 's certainly been an eye-opening experiment .
i 've learnt that i have to be organised in order to make public transport work .
apart from monday -lrb- when i got soaked -rrb- , i 've enjoyed the walk to and from the bus stops .
on the whole , it 's been pretty good week for weather , but if i had to walk then wait in the freezing cold and / or rain every day of the week , then i think i would very quickly lose the will to take public transport .
upstairs ' novelty ' apart from one occasion when the bus did n't turn up , the buses are fairly reliable , clean and cost-effective and joshua has enjoyed the novelty of being upstairs on a double-decker and seeing things he would n't normally see in the car .
it 's also been a bonus not having to fight for a parking space at work .
because of construction work on angus college 's new community access and learning centre , and other building works , spaces in the car park and on keptie road , where i normally park , are at a premium .
additionally , i 've found that i 've taken more exercise at lunchtimes too .
normally , on my 45 minute lunch break , i nip home in the car to do a little bit of housework .
however , as it would take too long to walk there and back , i 've spent my lunch breaks walking down to the local shops to buy a roll which definitely made me more refreshed for the afternoon .
i 'll definitely do more walking in future , during my lunch breaks .
lack of information my main bugbear from this week , is the lack of timetable information .
not all the stops have timetables , so for public transport novices like myself , unless we looked up the traveline scotland website in advance , we would have no idea of when the bus was due , or even if it was the right bus for us .
on the whole , the convenience , the reliability and quickness of the car outweighs the benefit of money i could save by either walking or getting the bus .
although i could probably live with commuting purely by public transport or by walking , other lifestyle factors , such as getting the shopping and visiting friends and family would be made more time-consuming and difficult .
having my car gives me more choices - it influences where i choose live , where i can work , where i send my son to school , where i can shop and much more etc .
therefore , i ca n't see me giving up my car any time soon .

there is always pressure to obtain business , but sales have to be profitable to achieve business success .
credit management at the heart of a healthy business is good credit management practice , keeping the cash flowing .

every business should know the level of credit it can afford to give , how much it is willing to sustain in the way of debtors and under what circumstances it can and will trade with customers .
establish precisely the nature of the legal entity of the customer - there is a world of difference in legal terms between a sole trader and a limited company .
quite simply , the sole trader is liable up to the full extent of his or her personal wealth for all debts incurred , whereas limited liability means just that - the liability of the director / shareholder is limited to the extent of his / her shareholding in the company .
so it is essential to ascertain the full name and the full and correct address of any firm that wishes to trade with you .

the invoice should be accurate and clear and should contain all the information required for the customer to pass it for payment , including the customer 's purchase order number .
the invoice should also say precisely when and where you expect to be paid - " payment due by ¿ " " payment should be made to ¿ " .

the reminder letter , firm but courteous , is timed according to your agreed terms as is the telephone ' chaser ' , but always remember : the sooner the better .
if there is a query , resolve it speedily - all impediments to payment should be removed the instant they appear .
getting paid is about knowing your customer , establishing the terms and exercising your rights .

the announcement came as the group reported sales in the three months to september had risen 6 % to £ 389m -lrb- $ 649.6m -rrb- from the previous three months .
marconi said strong sales in the us , in particular to the government , had helped boost the figures .
' cautious ' however , sales had slipped from the £ 514m the company recorded in the same period last year .
chief executive mike parton said : " whilst we remain cautious about the shorter term outlook , we are confident for the company 's and industry 's long term prospects . "
the company has recently emerged from a massive £ 4bn restructuring drive , shedding thousands of jobs and selling off units .

a company set up by the government will consider which airlines are to be offered subsidies to help establish new routes .
currently the only scheduled international service in and out of northern ireland is to amsterdam .
earlier this year , the government announced that £ 4m in subsidies would be available to airlines willing to plug some of the gaps - with paris and brussels high on the list .
it is understood several airlines have applied for help to launch a range of services including the low-cost airline ryanair .
they have been in discussion with belfast international airport for some time and are thought to have an agreement in principle with the airport if the finances are right .
it is understood their plan is to fly to a number of european destinations on top of flights to uk airports .

the claims were made by disgraced officer robert pulling , whose racist comments were broadcast in the undercover bbc tv documentary , the secret policeman , which filmed new recruits at a training school .
mr pulling resigned from north wales police following the screening of the programme on tuesday , but has claimed that his extreme views were not out of place in the force .
three officers from greater manchester and one from cheshire have also resigned .
mr pulling was the first to go , and was described as " a disgrace " by north wales ' deputy chief constable clive wolfendale .
the departure of the other four was confirmed later on wednesday .
three other policemen - one from north wales , two from greater manchester - have been suspended .
the north wales force called a media conference to discuss the bbc documentary , the secret policeman , which filmed mr pulling 's overt racist comments while he was both training and at work in wales .
he defended the force 's record on fighting racism after the programme , screened on tuesday , which led to eight officers - two in wales - being suspended .

clive wolfendale said he felt sick watching the programme he was suspended pending a north wales police investigation prior to the programme 's screening .
the second officer suspended was keith cheshire .
mr pulling was asked by undercover reporter mark daly during the filming if he was capable of killing an asian man .
he replied : " i 've got it in me ... it 's a hatred thing . "
mr pulling and others were heard criticising the only asian recruit in the intake .
when the man was required to retake some of the course , a number of the trainees were heard to cheer .
north wales police stressed it had been working hard to tackle racism within its own ranks .
we need to learn from what has happened and drive out any vestiges of racism that remain malcolm king , north wales police authority mr wolfendale described the men in the footage as " a group of racist delinquents " .
he said chief constable richard brunstrom would be writing to the family of murdered black teenager stephen lawrence to apologise for comments made in the film about the family and the tragedy they have suffered .
he said : " i felt physically sick as i watched the secret policeman last night .
rob pulling has resigned from north wales police " robert pulling was a raw recruit who had never walked the streets unsupervised , or dealt with an incident unchecked .
" he had not finished training , nor been exposed to the prevalent culture of north wales police .
but all of that is scant comfort .
" pulling has shamed his colleagues , his uniform , and the service .
he is a disgrace . "
he said he believed society was now more racist that it was five years ago , citing " national and international reasons " but added : " we are determined to deal with the consequences . "

malcolm king , chairman of north wales police authority , said : " clearly we need to learn from what has happened and drive out any vestiges of racism that remain in north wales police . "

about 50 net providers have signed-up so they can offer a 1mbps service from 20 november , it said .
more than 80 % of the uk can get adsl broadband , but some will miss out on the faster service because they live too far away from phone exchanges .
cable firms like ntl and telewest already offer a 1mbps connection , but they reach only 40 % of the population .
speedy service the six-week trials which started in october showed there was a " strong consumer demand " for the faster adsl -lrb- asymmetric digital subscriber line -rrb- service , said bt wholesale 's director of products bruce stanford .
the 1mbps is not " rate-adaptive " though , which means people living more than four kilometres from their telephone exchange which has been adsl-enabled will not be able to get the service at that speed .
well over a million now have access to high-speed adsl net access of 512kbps , which is about 10 times faster than dial-up access .
but there are still areas , particularly outside town and cities that do not have access to adsl-enabled telephone exchanges offering this kind of connection .
service providers will be charged a £ 50 connection fee , or a £ 35 upgrade fee for existing subscribers to be able to offer their customers the service .
monthly subscription charges are also likely to be slightly higher .

well over a million now have access to high-speed adsl net access of 512kbps , which is about 10 times faster than dial-up access .

monthly subscription charges are also likely to be slightly higher .

iraq needs about $ 36bn in reconstruction aid until 2007 the unanimous passage of a new united nations security council resolution giving qualified approval to what one might call the policy of " pacify and depart " has helped the atmosphere and will produce a bigger pot of money than had at one time been expected - but it has not opened all the wallets .
the big money will come from the united states which is pledging about $ 20bn , though there is a congressional battle going on about whether half of that should be a loan not a grant .
the american money would be split between electric power , water , oil production , transport , housing and health , with chunks for public safety and law enforcement as well .
madrid should mark the beginning of sustained economic recovery hilary benn uk minister a separate assessment of iraqi needs has come from the world bank and the un and this amounts to $ 36bn between now and 2007 .
towards this sum , japan has come up with $ 1.5bn , and britain and spain , supporters of the war , have promised $ 825m and $ 300m respectively .
row over british funds some of the british funds will come from aid originally earmarked for other countries , though not the poorest .
this has upset british charities but the british government says it is part of a trend to shift funding from " middle income " countries to the poorest ones .
iraq now qualifies as among the poorest with an annual income per person of some $ 400 to $ 600 .
the eu figure is a mere $ 200m .
further big sums will come from the world bank itself which is expected to come up with between $ 3.5bn and $ 5bn over five years .
the participation of the world bank is probably the best confidence-building measure of all , as it signals a level of international support for the plan .
nothing from some countries but despite iraq 's need , france and russia are giving nothing .
germany is offering only $ 100m , half of which is its share of a european union grant .
none of them want to be seen to be propping up an occupation .
france is sending a low-level delegation .
the russian deputy foreign minister yuri fedotov said : " iraq is not a poor country and has oil , agricultural and industrial resources .
russia is not planning to make a donation . "
the optimists say that the conference should help normalisation in iraq .
the british secretary for international development hilary benn , who is leading the british delegation , said : " madrid should mark the beginning of sustained economic recovery . "
he admitted however that two other elements of policy - security and democracy - were needed as well .
" if we can make the process succeed , iraq should have a brighter future after its nightmare , " he said .
trust fund one important element is an agreement to channel money through a new fund , the multi donors trust fund , to be administered by the world bank and the un , with various supervising committees .
iraq is not a poor country and has oil , agricultural and industrial resources yuri fedotov russian minister this has been established as a way of allowing countries to contribute without going through the american-led development fund for iraq .
there had been a concern that otherwise , donors would simply be supporting american and british policy .
the debt issue one big issue which is not on the formal agenda but which will certainly be on the delegates ' minds is that of iraqi debt .
saddam hussein ran up foreign debts of between $ 95bn and $ 150bn , according to figures compiled by jubilee iraq , a london-based network of iraqi exiles and sympathisers who are calling for the debt to be written off .
" this is an odious debt , " said jubilee iraq spokesman justin alexander .
" the iraqi people got no benefit from it .
it was used to fight the war with iran . "

it has always had a reputation for being a high-pressure environment - but now people are coming forward with stories of extreme harassment and bullying .
in one of the first surveys of its kind , the bbc has found disturbing evidence of the scale of these kinds of behaviour .
nearly one third of those surveyed said they had experienced bullying at work , with more saying they had witnessed others being bullied or harassed .
danny dove , an ex-trader , says : " it was painful , very , very painful .
there were days where i would go home crying , in tears and not want to go to work , and it did cause me a lot of problems . "

steven horkulak had claimed lee amaitis , president of brokerage firm cantor fitzgerald had hysterically screamed obscenities at him on a regular basis over six months over six months before he left the company in june 2000 .
there are plenty of stories circulating around the city but few affected workers are willing to come forward and talk about their experience .
to do so could effectively kill off any chance of a career in the square mile , where word travels fast and being seen as a troublemaker could mean the difference between unemployment and a very lucrative career .

called chromosome six , it is the largest such structure so far fully decoded in the human genome project .
uk researchers say its 166 million " letters " of dna contain 2,190 genes , nearly 6 % of the entire genetic code that describes the human lifeform .
the scientists report their study of chromosome six in the journal nature .
unknown function the international project to " read " all the dna in human cells was finally completed in april .
researchers are currently trying to make sense of this dna code .
their aim is to find within , the long list of letters , the locations of the genes and to determine what they do .
dna in human cells double-stranded dna molecule held together by chemical components called bases adenine -lrb- a -rrb- bonds with thymine -lrb- t -rrb- ; cytosine -lrb- c -rrb- bonds with guanine -lrb- g -rrb- groupings of these letters form the " code of life " .
estimated to be about 2.9bn base pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes written in the dna are about 30,000 genes which human cells use as templates to make proteins .
these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies so far this has been done for six chromosomes - numbers seven , 14 , 20 , 21 , 22 and the y , the dna bundle that carries the information for maleness .
now , scientists at the wellcome trust sanger institute at hinxton near cambridge have unveiled a fully annotated description of chromosome six .
of its 2,190 genes , the scientists say 633 are derelict - they are inactive genes that no longer operate .
the remaining 1,557 genes are believed to be all functional .
however , less than half of them have been previously described and their roles are unknown .
chromosome six is the site of the major histocompatability complex , a large region in the dna that is important for our immune response .
" chromosome six is very rich in immune genes .
these are the genes that give us protection from pathogens , " said stephan beck , the head of human sequencing at sanger .
" they basically determine whether or not you survive if you get infected by bacteria or viruses , " he said .
" these genes on chromosome six are involved in breaking down small bits of the invading pathogen and presenting it on the cell surface . "
on the cell 's surface , the foreign components are recognised by other cells that then realise it is infected and kill it .
disease genes researchers have identified roughly 130 genes on chromosome six that may predispose humans to certain diseases .
there are genetic markers for a juvenile-onset form of parkinson 's disease .
mutations in the so-called hfe gene cause hereditary haemochromatosis , a condition that afflicts one in 400 .
people who have this disorder absorb excessive amounts of iron which can lead to organ damage .
researchers are also interested in scrutinising a large segment of the genes responsible for making transfer rna , which helps translate the genetic blueprint into the proteins that build and maintain our bodies .
" a finished chromosome six reveals an abundance of biological information previously buried within the draft of the human genome assembly , " said jane grimwood , from the stanford human genome center in the us .

called chromosome six , it is the largest such structure so far fully decoded in the human genome project .
uk researchers say its 166 million " letters " of dna contain 2,190 genes , nearly 6 % of the entire genetic code that describes the human lifeform .
the scientists report their study of chromosome six in the journal nature .
unknown function the international project to " read " all the dna in human cells was finally completed in april .
researchers are currently trying to make sense of this dna code .
their aim is to find within , the long list of letters , the locations of the genes and to determine what they do .
dna in human cells double-stranded dna molecule held together by chemical components called bases adenine -lrb- a -rrb- bonds with thymine -lrb- t -rrb- ; cytosine -lrb- c -rrb- bonds with guanine -lrb- g -rrb- groupings of these letters form the " code of life " .
estimated to be about 2.9bn base pairs in the human genome wound into 24 distinct bundles , or chromosomes written in the dna are about 30,000 genes which human cells use as templates to make proteins .
these sophisticated molecules build and maintain our bodies so far this has been done for six chromosomes - numbers seven , 14 , 20 , 21 , 22 and the y , the dna bundle that carries the information for maleness .
now , scientists at the wellcome trust sanger institute at hinxton near cambridge have unveiled a fully annotated description of chromosome six .
of its 2,190 genes , the scientists say 633 are derelict - they are inactive genes that no longer operate .
the remaining 1,557 genes are believed to be all functional .
however , less than half of them have been previously described and their roles are unknown .
chromosome six is the site of the major histocompatability complex , a large region in the dna that is important for our immune response .
" chromosome six is very rich in immune genes .
these are the genes that give us protection from pathogens , " said stephan beck , the head of human sequencing at sanger .
" they basically determine whether or not you survive if you get infected by bacteria or viruses , " he said .
" these genes on chromosome six are involved in breaking down small bits of the invading pathogen and presenting it on the cell surface . "
on the cell 's surface , the foreign components are recognised by other cells that then realise it is infected and kill it .
disease genes researchers have identified roughly 130 genes on chromosome six that may predispose humans to certain diseases .
there are genetic markers for a juvenile-onset form of parkinson 's disease .
mutations in the so-called hfe gene cause hereditary haemochromatosis , a condition that afflicts one in 400 .
people who have this disorder absorb excessive amounts of iron which can lead to organ damage .
researchers are also interested in scrutinising a large segment of the genes responsible for making transfer rna , which helps translate the genetic blueprint into the proteins that build and maintain our bodies .

the rejection follows a similar decision by the australian competition authorities in september , and looks likely to be the final straw for the merger proposals .
if it had gone ahead , the new zealand commerce commission -lrb- nzcc -rrb- warned , prices might have risen by almost a fifth .
the higher prices might deter up to 190,000 new zealanders from travelling abroad each year , it said .
there are simply too many airlines in the world today geoff dixon , qantas chief executive the airlines said they still felt the case for the merger was solid , and would seek grounds to appeal .
" we still believe an alliance between qantas and air nz is in the best interests of aviation in this region , and would deliver significant benefits to travellers and tourism , " said qantas chief executive geoff dixon .
" there are simply too many airlines in the world today , and it is inevitable that there will be further pressures towards consolidation and some very large and powerful groups could emerge . "
concerns the plan was for qantas to pay nz $ 500m for a 22.5 % stake in air nz , and for the two to share routes to , from and within new zealand .
flights from emirates and low-cost airline virgin blue would ensure that consumers did not lose out , qantas and air nz said .
and they pointed out that neither had ever made a profit competing on the domestic market in new zealand .
but that was not enough for the nzcc .
" the competition provided by these carriers is not sufficient to allay all of the commission 's concerns , " said nzcc acting chairwoman paula rebstock .
" for the travelling public , that could mean airfares that were , on average , 19 % higher , as well as reduced quality of service and fewer flights . "
