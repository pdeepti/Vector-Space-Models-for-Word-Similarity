north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2003 controversial ' abortion boat ' reaches polish shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : womens groups are welcoming a dutch abortion ship , but religious groups and government leaders are outraged by its presence .
a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .
it said the massacre was " a particularly brutal but unfortunately not unique action by german soldiers .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .

the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .
it said the massacre was " a particularly brutal but unfortunately not unique action by german soldiers .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .

there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .

two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2003 controversial ' abortion boat ' reaches polish shores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : womens groups are welcoming a dutch abortion ship , but religious groups and government leaders are outraged by its presence .
a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .

the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .

the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.06.2003 germany 's 2004 budget plan raises eyebrows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel calls for cuts in benefits and subsidies to balance the budget .
german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .
his growth assumptions were unrealistic , according to the deputy head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedrich merz .
hesse 's premier roland koch , also cdu , told the newspaper die welt his party would prevent homeowner 's allowances from being cut when the proposal reached the bundestag , germany 's upper legislative chamber . nor is koch 's threat empty - the budget can only be implemented if the opposition-controlled bundestag approves it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .
it said the massacre was " a particularly brutal but unfortunately not unique action by german soldiers .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .

they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .
his growth assumptions were unrealistic , according to the deputy head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedrich merz .
hesse 's premier roland koch , also cdu , told the newspaper die welt his party would prevent homeowner 's allowances from being cut when the proposal reached the bundestag , germany 's upper legislative chamber . nor is koch 's threat empty - the budget can only be implemented if the opposition-controlled bundestag approves it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .
it said the massacre was " a particularly brutal but unfortunately not unique action by german soldiers .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .
his growth assumptions were unrealistic , according to the deputy head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedrich merz .
hesse 's premier roland koch , also cdu , told the newspaper die welt his party would prevent homeowner 's allowances from being cut when the proposal reached the bundestag , germany 's upper legislative chamber . nor is koch 's threat empty - the budget can only be implemented if the opposition-controlled bundestag approves it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .
it said the massacre was " a particularly brutal but unfortunately not unique action by german soldiers .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2003 baltic sea nations compromise on environmental protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin forged a compromise with other baltic sea nations .
north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .

he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .

-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .
his growth assumptions were unrealistic , according to the deputy head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedrich merz .
hesse 's premier roland koch , also cdu , told the newspaper die welt his party would prevent homeowner 's allowances from being cut when the proposal reached the bundestag , germany 's upper legislative chamber . nor is koch 's threat empty - the budget can only be implemented if the opposition-controlled bundestag approves it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?
the prestige failed to live up to its name when the aging tanker sunk in the atlantic on tuesday .
catastrophic oil spills have plagued europe for years , and experts are asking why more has n't been done to prevent them .

though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .
although it had already been agreed to end the practice by 2020 , britain and france unsuccessfully pushed for a higher initial level of radioactivity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an avoidable disaster ?

german finance minister hans eichel revealed his budget proposal for 2004 this week , but the head of the european central bank warns that germany is charting the wrong course . germany 's finance ministry presented the first comprehensive draft of its € 251 billion -lrb- $ 287 billion -rrb- federal fiscal budget for 2004 on thursday . under the budget , new debts would total € 23.8 million and investments would make up € 24.8 million , bringing it in line with germany 's constitution , which requires that investments must exceed deficit spending . the budget would achieve that balance through cuts to benefits for government employees , cuts in subsidies and the elimination of some tax write-offs . government payments to the pension and welfare systems will each be slashed by € 2 billion , and the coal industry is slated to lose € 550 million in government subsidies .
the government is also planning to dramatically reduce christmas bonuses for current and retired civil servants and will eliminate the so-called " vacation bonus , " which provides the equivalent of a 14th month of pay .
but the budget cuts will also hit the pockets of non-government workers - especially those who rely on tax write-offs for commuting , which will also be cut .
another provision in the german budget that provides subsidies for first-time homeowners is also being scrapped . ecb leader warns germany the budget proposal is based on germany 's economy growing by 2 percent in 2004 , a level it has been unable to achieve so far in 2003 .
in 2002 , the country exceeded the 3 percent ceiling on deficit spending cemented in the european pact ensuring the stability of the euro .
it is expected to do the same this year and again in 2004 . european central bank president wim duisenberg admonished german leaders on thursday to stick to their fiscal pledges .
he said he was worried that the 2004 budget proposed by the german finance minister earlier in the day would again force germany to violate the european union stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone members must keep their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product . " the direction -lsb- germany -rsb- is going concerns me .
-lsb- it -rsb- means debts will increase , although they should decrease .
that is what was agreed in the stability and growth pact , " duisenberg told the german public television broadcaster zdf . duisenberg said the most important aim in the current economic situation in germany was to gain consumers ' and investors ' trust .
and the way to do that was for the government to live up to agreements it had made , like remaining in line with the stability pact . duisenberg was not alone in his concerns .
european union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs pedro solbes warned germany on tuesday not to neglect eu budgetary guidelines in the current debate over tax reform .
he said germany could not count on support from the eu if the german government decided to cut taxes and thus failed to stay within the stability pact . a stagnating economy germany 's economy has been stagnating since 2001 .
unemployment reached 4.45 million in may and consumer confidence remains low . the government is expected to call for a pushing forward of tax cuts planned for 2005 to next year , but it will have to reduce spending in other areas to offset a loss of € 18 billion in revenues and stay within the euro zone budget deficit limit .
ministers and coalition party leaders will be discussing the plans at a retreat scheduled to take place this weekend . but opposition leaders have already attacked eichel 's budget plans .
his growth assumptions were unrealistic , according to the deputy head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedrich merz .
hesse 's premier roland koch , also cdu , told the newspaper die welt his party would prevent homeowner 's allowances from being cut when the proposal reached the bundestag , germany 's upper legislative chamber . nor is koch 's threat empty - the budget can only be implemented if the opposition-controlled bundestag approves it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .

in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

north and baltic sea nations thursday agreed at a summit in bremen to designate parts of both bodies of water as environmentally sensitive areas .
the compromise avoided russia ’ s initial veto of wider protection measures . environment ministers from nations bordering the north and baltic seas were able to forge a last-minute compromise to give both partial status as a particularly sensitive sea area -lrb- pssa -rrb- .
though the deal will extend greater environmental protection to a few key regions , it falls far short of what some countries had wanted . some nations such as germany and sweden had hoped to give the entire baltic sea pssa status , but russia on wednesday vetoed the proposal .
german environment minister jürgen trittin conceded the two-day summit in the northern german town of bremen had fallen somewhat short of its original goals . “ naturally we didn ’ t quite manage as much as we would have liked , ” trittin said , according to the associated press .
he said , however , it was an important step that russia had been convinced not to completely reject greater conservation measures . many environmental experts had hoped for greater protection for the baltic sea , since – as the world ’ s largest brackish body of water – it has many rare and unique ecosystems .
they also say the baltic is at particular risk should an oil spill occur , since it takes around 30 years for a complete exchange of the sea ’ s water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european governments have been keen to push through tighter environmental regulations in the wake of the prestige oil tanker spill in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain last year .
the spill sent thousands of tons of oil onto spanish beaches and killed unknown numbers of fish , birds and other wildlife . environmentalists disappointed environmental groups were disappointed by the results of the summit .
“ this agreement will lead to an accelerated death for the baltic sea .
shipping has doubled since 1997 and it will triple in the coming years . ” said stephan lutter , a spokesman for the german branch of the world wildlife fund .
“ a tanker accident like the prestige near spain would in a matter of days destroy life in the baltic sea for decades . ” russia , which ships vast quantities of oil via the baltic , is also a notorious polluter of the sea , leading to its reluctance to pursue greater conservation measures .
the nine nations bordering the baltic sea did , however , agree to increase the areas where pilot and tug boats are required for shipping . “ as you know , in a family there ’ s often the problem where you ’ re agreed on the goal with your wife , but not in the method to reach it .
it ’ s the same thing with these countries .
there are different interests , different approaches and priorities , ” said mieczyslaw ostojski , the polish general secretary of the helsinki commission . the summit in bremen marked the first time the commissions for both the north -lrb- oslo / paris commission -rrb- and baltic -lrb- helsinki commission -rrb- seas met together .
aside from the issue of pssa status , the ministers agreed to set up a network of protected sea areas outside of nations ’ 12-mile economic zone by 2010 . the countries also approved a german suggestion on measuring and reducing the level of radioactive water pumped into the north sea .

the court said germany was only liable to pay compensation to states , not to individuals affected by war crimes perpetrated almost 60 years ago . " this massacre is one of the most despicable crimes of world war ii , " presiding judge eberhard rinne told the court .
but he explained that " moral or humanitarian aspects could not play a role because the case could only be considered according to the limited means of the law . " brutal retaliation the case was brought by four siblings whose parents were killed in distomo . on june 10 , 1944 greek partisan fighters ambushed soldiers from an ss tank division near the mountain village , killing four of the germans and forcing the remaining troops to retreat .
in retaliation , the ss killed every man , woman and child they could find in distomo and burnt down the village .
the oldest victim was a 85 , the youngest a two-month-old baby . after the war the perpetrators of the massacre were acquitted in the nuremburg war trial for lack of evidence . today greeks see distomo as a memorial to the nazi occupation of the country from 1941 - 1944 .
for years survivors of the massacre have been trying to claim compensation from the german state .
in 1997 a greek court in livadia ordered germany to pay the plaintiffs around € 28 million -lrb- $ 32 million -rrb- .
germany fought the decision in greece 's highest civil court , the areopag , but in 2000 it lost . germany - which had already given greece around € 67 million in reparations in the 1960s - then refused to pay the distomo survivors .
the 200 plaintiffs tried to force the sale of the buildings of the goethe institute - germany 's cultural and educational organization - in athens , but failed after the greek government did not back the action . around 60,000 greek claims claims from survivors and their relatives have already been rejected in lower german courts and by the european court of human rights .
in the 1970s a munich court suspended criminal investigations into the distomo massacre because the statute of limitations had expired .
some 60,000 greek plaintiffs have filed claims against germany . the federal court of justice in karlsruhe also dismissed the earlier ruling from the areopag , saying that it violated the principle of state immunity , whereby states may not judge other states .
both the european court of human rights and greece 's supreme court confirmed the legality of state immunity in rulings last year .
the german government and the plaintiffs ' lawyer also agreed that the decision was legally flawed and not binding . in the course of the latest distomo legal proceeding , the government said it deeply regretted the events , but still rejected paying reparations to the survivors .

a dutch abortion rights group left poland - where abortion is virtually banned - for international waters on thursday .
two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .
only the polish government can help these women , " women on waves founder rebecca gomperts told deutsche welle .
" we can only make the problem visible . " problems from the start the langenort has been faced with difficulties since it made its way to poland . the boat was met by angry protesters from the league of polish families -lrb- lpr -rrb- , who hollered insults and threw stones and red paint at the ship when it pulled into wladyslawowo on sunday .
it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .
" but also because abortion was legal until ten years ago .
we came for the ten year anniversary . " protesters have managed to prevent women on waves from opening the ship to the public so far .
but gomperts said the group has received enthusiastic support from poles .
they plan to stay in or near poland until july 5 . shifting laws poland 's abortion laws have changed numerous times since the fall of communism in 1989 , depending on who controlled the government , which has been passed back and forth between conservatives and leftist communists . today , poland has one of the strictest abortion laws in europe - second only to ireland .
women may only terminate a pregnancy if it threatens their health , they have been raped or the fetus is damaged .
doctors who perform illegal abortions face up to three years in jail . polish pope john paul ii , who determinedly opposes abortion , is widely viewed as the greatest moral authority in this roman catholic country . poland is n't the first country with restrictive family planning laws whose legal system the dutch group has sought to circumvent to provide abortions .
women on waves first attracted attention in 2001 , when the group sailed to ireland in a similar undertaking .
but they called off plans to distribute the " abortion pill " at the last minute because they still had not received a license from the dutch health ministry . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles give overwhelming nod to eu membership the largest of the ten new european union member states approved membership in the union over a two-day referendum this weekend .

two doctors may help polish women to terminate their pregnancies on board . the langenort , a dutch tugboat that has been dubbed by many as the " abortion ship , " left the port of wladyslawowo , poland , on thursday and headed for international waters , where doctors are planning to provide safe abortion services for polish women who are banned by law from obtaining the procedures in their own country .
outfitted with medicines , a gynecological treatment room and information on family planning and contraception , women on waves , as the pro-choice group behind the langenort is called , arrived in poland last weekend .
the activists say they aim to draw attention to the problems of illegal abortions and offer women counseling .
the group is licensed by the dutch health ministry to dispense the " abortion pill " ru-486 .
though it may not do so in poland , it may in the international waters some 12 miles -lrb- 19 kilometers -rrb- off the polish shore .
the boat is also equipped with condoms , the " morning after pill " and the means to perform clinical abortions . the ship left harbor carrying two doctors , eight crew members and as many as 20 women who were seeking abortions .
but the organization that has brought the ship to poland is also seeking to make a political statement . " this is not a solution to the problem .

it was soon visited by police and customs officials , who sealed the medication they found on board on wednesday in order to prevent its distribution in poland . but the group will not be prosecuted if it breaks the seals in international waters . there have been other problems , too .
before the boat was allowed to leave polish waters again , women on waves had to pay a fine levied by the wladyslawowo harbor master for entering the port without permission .
gomperts said the breach had been the result of a misunderstanding between the english-speaking captain and polish-speaking harbor officials . 10 year anniversary gomperts said the activists were invited to wladyslawowo by polish women 's organizations . " that 's the main reason -lsb- we came -rsb- , " she explained .

the people behind the scheme say a private investor is interested in putting £ 1m behind the scheme to recreate hms beagle at devonport dockyard .
but there has been no money yet from sources such as the devonport regeneration company , plymouth city council , government office south west or the regional development agency .
the devonport beagle project is working with these agencies and says they need to deliver to move the scheme further forward .
traditional skills the project aims to regenerate one of devon 's most deprived areas .
the plans to build a replica of the ship , on which charles darwin sailed into the history books , would bring much-needed jobs to the depressed area .
the initiative would train and employ local people in traditional shipbuilding skills .

staff working in the new-style hospitals across the border could br offered better wages and terms than their welsh counterparts .
medical staff in wales fear that could lead to a brain drain of talent and expertise .
doctors in wales are pressing for new consultant contracts to be agreed to counter the threat .
foundation hospitals , which would be semi-independent and have the power to raise their own money , are supported by the labour government at westminster .
but they have been ruled out by the welsh assembly government .
salary structure first minister rhodri morgan has already warned that welsh hospitals would suffer as a result of a two-tier salary structure in the uk health service .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- in wales will voice its concerns at its conference next week .
dr carl wright , a consultant in radiology at glan clwyd hospital , bodelwyddan , said he feared that some staff were leaving wales .
" i think it 's happening already , " he said .
" consultants have moved from welsh hospitals .
" it 's multi-factorial - salaries are only part of it and working environment is also significant . "
the problem could be particularly acute for hospitals closest to the border , and specialist registrars are said to be looking toward cheshire and liverpool .
the bma opposes foundation hospitals in principle and says it fears an " offa 's dyke " of the new institutions in neighbouring english areas .
avon has been approached to apply to set them up , and shrewsbury , hereford and chester are said to be interested . "
they -lrb- doctors -rrb- are not leaving .
there 's always been cross-border movement " jane hutt the royal college of nursing is also worried about the impact on staffing levels .
there are already hundreds of nurse vacancies in wales .
senior nurse gareth phillips , of anglesey , spends his spare time looking after his ducks and geese , because , he says , a low salary forces him to rely on home-produced food to keep his cost of living down .
mr phillips has worked in a foundation hospital in canada , and said he would not think twice about moving away from wales again .
he added : " if foundation hospitals are offering better conditions and salaries , foundation hospitals are going to be able to pick the most experienced nurses and we are going to get a drift of nurses across the border . "
but welsh health minister , jane hutt , said improvements in the nhs in wales would stop any cross-border brain drain .
" we 've decided not to have foundation hospitals in wales and we have our own plans in place , " she said .
" they -lrb- doctors -rrb- are not leaving .
there 's always been cross-border movement .
" doctors and nurses are coming on board and we are training many more . "
talks on consultants contracts have stalled in england , but the bma said negotiations with the assembly government on the welsh equivalent were going well .
as well as addressing pay , the contracts would set limits for private practice and regulate the amount of managerial influence on consultants ' schedules .

welsh labour leaders could reopen a row with some parts of their party when they examine how to increase the number of women in politics .
the executive of the wales labour party will meet on friday to decide whether to impose all-women shortlists for the next westminster elections .
but that would be strongly resisted by some local branches , who want to keep the freedom to choose their own candidate to become their next mp .
there would be fierce opposition , for example , in the south wales valley seat of blaenau gwent .
' real experts ' the local mp , llew smith , has announced that he will stand down at the next election .
laura jones became a conservative am without a shortlist he told bbc radio wales that any attempt to impose an all-woman shortlist on his local party would be resisted .
mr smith said : " this is not about positive discrimination .
" if it was , why are n't we discriminating in favour of people who are disabled , who come from ethnic minorities , -lrb- or -rrb- who come from working-class communities .
" this is about politics and what 's ironic is that if this system had been in operation when my predecessors nye bevan and michael foot had been seeking nomination , they would n't have been able to apply for their positions . "
" we 've got a position in our constituency party where 100 % of the party - that 's both male and female - are determined that we are not going to be imposed on . "
women are 50 % of the labour party -lrb- but -rrb- there have only been seven women mps in wales in the whole history of the vote julie morgan mp when asked what the blaenau gwent party would do to oppose any decision in favour of all-women shortlists , mr smith said : " i find it hard to imagine that they are going to sit back and accept that decision . "
cardiff north mp julie morgan , who is in favour of all-women shortlists , said their adoption was needed to end a situation in which just seven female mps have ever represented welsh seats .
mrs morgan said : " women are 50 % of the labour party -lrb- but -rrb- there have only been seven women mps in wales in the whole history of the vote .
" -lrb- at the moment -rrb- there are four women mps out of 40 .
" we have to take some measure to ensure that there 's fairer representation . "
he has said that he is not concerned whether the next mp is a man or a woman , but simply " a good socialist with a certain amount of courage " .
labour adopted all-women shortlists in six seats for this year 's welsh assembly election .
the results meant the assembly has 30 out of 60 women members - the first nationally-elected body in the world with at least 50 % female representation .
other parties have resisted imposing shortlists .
the conservatives had no women ams in the assembly 's first term , but now two of their 11 are female .

welsh labour leaders could reopen a row with some parts of their party when they examine how to increase the number of women in politics .
the executive of the wales labour party will meet on friday to decide whether to impose all-women shortlists for the next westminster elections .
but that would be strongly resisted by some local branches , who want to keep the freedom to choose their own candidate to become their next mp .
there would be fierce opposition , for example , in the south wales valley seat of blaenau gwent .
' real experts ' the local mp , llew smith , has announced that he will stand down at the next election .
laura jones became a conservative am without a shortlist he told bbc radio wales that any attempt to impose an all-woman shortlist on his local party would be resisted .
mr smith said : " this is not about positive discrimination .
" if it was , why are n't we discriminating in favour of people who are disabled , who come from ethnic minorities , -lrb- or -rrb- who come from working-class communities .
" this is about politics and what 's ironic is that if this system had been in operation when my predecessors nye bevan and michael foot had been seeking nomination , they would n't have been able to apply for their positions . "
" we 've got a position in our constituency party where 100 % of the party - that 's both male and female - are determined that we are not going to be imposed on . "
women are 50 % of the labour party -lrb- but -rrb- there have only been seven women mps in wales in the whole history of the vote julie morgan mp when asked what the blaenau gwent party would do to oppose any decision in favour of all-women shortlists , mr smith said : " i find it hard to imagine that they are going to sit back and accept that decision . "
cardiff north mp julie morgan , who is in favour of all-women shortlists , said their adoption was needed to end a situation in which just seven female mps have ever represented welsh seats .
mrs morgan said : " women are 50 % of the labour party -lrb- but -rrb- there have only been seven women mps in wales in the whole history of the vote .
" -lrb- at the moment -rrb- there are four women mps out of 40 .

pictures from along the trent the industry is contributing to research via a £ 277,000 grant from the aggregates levy sustainability fund .
the fund , overseen by english heritage , has been used to establish the trent valley geoarchaeology project .
project co-ordinator mike bishop says the valley is " dense with archaeological remains " , including prehistoric ritual monuments and roman settlements .
however in many cases these remains are only visible by studying so-called " crop marks " , usually seen from the air .
these marks are tell-tale signs caused when crop growth is affected by differences in soil depth .
for example , deeper soil caused by an ancient ditch increases nutrients and moisture , making a crop ripen earlier .

the trent valley geoarchaeology project brings together many councils , trusts and universities which have an interest in the region .
along with charting crop marks , the project 's various schemes include : mapping ancient river channels .
producing maps about archaeological sites .
adding to the trent valley sites and monuments record maintained by local authorities .

river trent river ends at humber estuary about 35 types of fish under roman rule it was called ' trisantona ' a key use of the information will include helping planners decide where future gravel pits can be located .
mr bishop also hopes the information will be the foundation for future archaeological studies .

now a run-down industrial town is looking to become south wales ' literary capital .
blaenavon is trying to reverse its declining fortunes by becoming an unlikely mecca for book-lovers , and this saturday will declare itself " booktown " .
ten new bookstores have just opened behind boarded-up shopfronts in the torfaen town afflicted by industrial decline and a shrinking population in recent years .
it is already pulling in tourists from across the world , say backers , who are betting that book power will prove a money-spinning draw to revitalise the town .
bookish local people supported plans in february to roll out the project , part of a network of 50 international booktown projects trying to kick-start underperforming economies .
can literature help blaenavon turn from its industrial past ?
moulded by coal and steel , blaenavon was once home to 25,000 people , but now numbers just 6,000 .
despite world heritage site status putting it alongside great landmarks like egypt 's pyramids , the forecast of 250,000 annual visitors has not materialised .
but project leader james hanna says blaenavon can emulate hay , the original booktown , where an annual festival and 39 bookstores attract 50,000 visitors a year .
' shining example ' " it 's a good way to reverse declining economies - a tourist draw , " the hay-based american - a bookseller since the age of six at home in mississippi - told bbc news online .

" blaenavon needs economic revitalisation - the place was once known as ' plywood city ' because of the number of boarded-up shopfronts . "
but , working with torfaen council , he was given favourable rent options on those properties and has helped 10 new booksellers - half of them local - set up behind their now-revamped facades .
tourists bookworms could make a day of it , added mr hanna , picking up lunch and a few books in blaenavon , then driving 30 miles north to hay for dinner .
" they 've already been coming from everywhere - from cyprus , for example , just about everywhere you can think of , " he said .
" it 's mind-boggling - the town is being revitalised .
" it has gone so incredibly well , we plan to open half a dozen more bookstores , a gallery , coffee shop and bistro . "
visitors will follow in the footsteps of the town 's miners - many keen readers and book hoarders - according to mr hanna , who was busily painting shelves before saturday 's official launch .
torfaen council chiefs recently forecast the plan would be a " an exciting , win-win situation " for the town .

now a run-down industrial town is looking to become south wales ' literary capital .
blaenavon is trying to reverse its declining fortunes by becoming an unlikely mecca for book-lovers , and this saturday will declare itself " booktown " .
ten new bookstores have just opened behind boarded-up shopfronts in the torfaen town afflicted by industrial decline and a shrinking population in recent years .
it is already pulling in tourists from across the world , say backers , who are betting that book power will prove a money-spinning draw to revitalise the town .
bookish local people supported plans in february to roll out the project , part of a network of 50 international booktown projects trying to kick-start underperforming economies .
can literature help blaenavon turn from its industrial past ?
moulded by coal and steel , blaenavon was once home to 25,000 people , but now numbers just 6,000 .
despite world heritage site status putting it alongside great landmarks like egypt 's pyramids , the forecast of 250,000 annual visitors has not materialised .
but project leader james hanna says blaenavon can emulate hay , the original booktown , where an annual festival and 39 bookstores attract 50,000 visitors a year .
' shining example ' " it 's a good way to reverse declining economies - a tourist draw , " the hay-based american - a bookseller since the age of six at home in mississippi - told bbc news online .
world booktowns blaenavon , wales bredevoort , holland fjærland , norway hay-on-wye , wales montolieu , france redu , belgium st pierre de clages , switzerland sysmä , finland stillwater , minnesota " hay was primarily a farming economy , now it 's a thriving tourist economy - it 's a shining example .
" blaenavon needs economic revitalisation - the place was once known as ' plywood city ' because of the number of boarded-up shopfronts . "
but , working with torfaen council , he was given favourable rent options on those properties and has helped 10 new booksellers - half of them local - set up behind their now-revamped facades .
tourists bookworms could make a day of it , added mr hanna , picking up lunch and a few books in blaenavon , then driving 30 miles north to hay for dinner .
" they 've already been coming from everywhere - from cyprus , for example , just about everywhere you can think of , " he said .
" it 's mind-boggling - the town is being revitalised .
" it has gone so incredibly well , we plan to open half a dozen more bookstores , a gallery , coffee shop and bistro . "
