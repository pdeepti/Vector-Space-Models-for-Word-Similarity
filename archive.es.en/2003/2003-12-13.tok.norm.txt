abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2003 eu constitution summit fails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw and madrid were unable to see things silvio 's way .
eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .
that could mean a europe of different speeds is created , where a core of states take the lead on deeping their political ties , as other remain more loosely associated . french president jacques chirac said a group of pioneer states would push europe forward " faster , further and better .

abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?
the dav maintains that internet pharmacies don ’ t offer sufficient information about the products on their site , or about the health risks associated with those products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt .
a day before the ruling , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- picture -rrb- said that the government is interested in allowing a “ regulated , controlled and supervised electronic trade , including internet mail order ” of medicinal products . under the new german regulations , only pharmacies with adequate logistics for quick delivery and enough staff to ensure proper consumer protection may sell medicines over the internet . schmidt said germany should not be shut out of “ modern technologies and new sales methods . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .
dw-world looks at the law 's main points .
-lrb- sept.26 , 2003 -rrb- filling prescriptions with a click starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.12.2003 eu constitution summit fails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw and madrid were unable to see things silvio 's way .
eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .

abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .

the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .

abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .
that could mean a europe of different speeds is created , where a core of states take the lead on deeping their political ties , as other remain more loosely associated . french president jacques chirac said a group of pioneer states would push europe forward " faster , further and better .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .
that could mean a europe of different speeds is created , where a core of states take the lead on deeping their political ties , as other remain more loosely associated . french president jacques chirac said a group of pioneer states would push europe forward " faster , further and better .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .

as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following .

but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?
the dav maintains that internet pharmacies don ’ t offer sufficient information about the products on their site , or about the health risks associated with those products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt .
a day before the ruling , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- picture -rrb- said that the government is interested in allowing a “ regulated , controlled and supervised electronic trade , including internet mail order ” of medicinal products . under the new german regulations , only pharmacies with adequate logistics for quick delivery and enough staff to ensure proper consumer protection may sell medicines over the internet . schmidt said germany should not be shut out of “ modern technologies and new sales methods . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .

since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .

according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .

" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .

germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?
the dav maintains that internet pharmacies don ’ t offer sufficient information about the products on their site , or about the health risks associated with those products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt .
a day before the ruling , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- picture -rrb- said that the government is interested in allowing a “ regulated , controlled and supervised electronic trade , including internet mail order ” of medicinal products . under the new german regulations , only pharmacies with adequate logistics for quick delivery and enough staff to ensure proper consumer protection may sell medicines over the internet . schmidt said germany should not be shut out of “ modern technologies and new sales methods . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .

abelghani mzoudi , a moroccan suspected of aiding sept .
11 terrorists and surprisingly released from german custody last week , has applied for political asylum to avoid extradition to the united states . mzoudi ’ s attorney on saturday gül pinar confirmed media reports he is hoping asylum in germany will protect him from being sent back to morocco , where he fears he would be handed over to u.s. officials . mzoudi ’ s was unexpectedly freed on thursday after the judge presiding over his case said an unidentified government source had testified the moroccan was not part of a so-called “ hamburg cell ” that planned the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?
the dav maintains that internet pharmacies don ’ t offer sufficient information about the products on their site , or about the health risks associated with those products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt .
a day before the ruling , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- picture -rrb- said that the government is interested in allowing a “ regulated , controlled and supervised electronic trade , including internet mail order ” of medicinal products . under the new german regulations , only pharmacies with adequate logistics for quick delivery and enough staff to ensure proper consumer protection may sell medicines over the internet . schmidt said germany should not be shut out of “ modern technologies and new sales methods . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.12.2003 in laugh-deprived germany , funniest man takes a bow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt says he needs to take a " creative break . "
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?
the dav maintains that internet pharmacies don ’ t offer sufficient information about the products on their site , or about the health risks associated with those products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt .
a day before the ruling , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- picture -rrb- said that the government is interested in allowing a “ regulated , controlled and supervised electronic trade , including internet mail order ” of medicinal products . under the new german regulations , only pharmacies with adequate logistics for quick delivery and enough staff to ensure proper consumer protection may sell medicines over the internet . schmidt said germany should not be shut out of “ modern technologies and new sales methods . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .

on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .

at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington . mzoudi ’ s release from custody was criticized by german prosecutors who fear he could try and flee the country as his trial continues this month .
prosecution spokeswoman frauke-katrin scheuten said on saturday that the new information did not warrant a change of tactics . “ the content of the testimony presented by the authorities in no way warrants a different legal opinion , ” scheuten told the dpa news agency .
however , with latest turn of event are likely to make it harder for the government will be able to prove its case against mzoudi . mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody after judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case “ clearly exonerates ” mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks that destroyed the world trade center . evidence suggests a four-man cell the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . mossadeq is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .

eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights . berlusconi , current holder of the eu presidency , was unable to avoid the scuppering of the talks designed to pave the way for a new eu constitution . “ unfortunately there was complete disagreement as we dealt with the topic of the voting system , ” he told a press conference after the talks collapsed .
“ unity in this question at the current time is not possible . ” european union leaders meeting in brussels this weekend had made little headway on the first day of the summit .
at the heart of the dispute is the reluctance of poland and spain to accept newly weighted voting rights in the draft text , which would greatly reduce the influence of the two countries . berlusconi said earlier he would present a number of compromise suggestions , but had warned if the leaders failed to accept them all of the work the italian eu presidency had put towards approving the constitution could be in vain . the new constitution is supposed to prepare the eu for next may when it expands from 15 to 25 members .
most observers consider the bloc ’ s current institutional setup as too unwieldy and inefficient .
besides ending the rotation of the eu presidency amongst the national governments , the draft constitution aims to streamline the eu commission and decision-making . warsaw and madrid both object to how the proposed constitution would curtail smaller countries ’ voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
the 2000 nice treaty gave poland and spain 27 votes each , only two less than much more populous france and germany .
the new constitution would change that and require a so-called double majority : decisions would have to be approved by a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the eu ’ s population . berlin and paris play hardball germany and france have refused to give in on the matter and said they would rather postpone adoption of the entire document until a later date rather than approving pieces of it . talks between german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister leszek miller on friday morning failed to make any headway in the matter .
on saturday , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz renewed warsaw ’ s threat that poland might walk away from the summit .
“ if there no chance for deal today we should wait , ” he told the reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has warned germany ’ s eastern neighbor that torpedoing the constitution over the voting rights issues would not look good for poland , one of 10 countries slated to join the eu next may .
" one can not want to become a new member of the eu and begin this membership with a veto , " schröder said earlier this week . how the eu will now proceed on the matter of the constitution is unclear .
the irish government , which takes over the eu presidency from italy in january , has expressed concern over having the constitution debate spill over into its term .
but berlusconi has pointed out that no major eu project has been pushed through within a single presidency ’ s six-month term before . although a deal could still be struck in the coming weeks , the six founding eu members showed after the collapse of the summit that there could be another alternative to a constitution for all 25 countries . france , germany , italy , the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg , which formed the european coal and steel community in 1951 later to become the european union , have declared their determination to move ahead with greater integration .
that could mean a europe of different speeds is created , where a core of states take the lead on deeping their political ties , as other remain more loosely associated . french president jacques chirac said a group of pioneer states would push europe forward " faster , further and better .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .

according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?

until now , germany has banned the sale of medicines by mail order .
but a new ruling by the european court of justice , plus changes to german health regulations now give germans the right to buy medicines online . according to thursday ’ s ruling by the european court of justice , germany has to allow the sale of non-prescription drugs by internet mail order . the court found that the current german ban is in contradiction of european law , as it infringes on the free movement of goods . however , the court also ruled that a national ban is permissible if it applies to drugs that haven ’ t been approved in germany , or drugs that require a prescription .
but that part of the ruling will effectively become irrelevant next year as new german laws aimed at modernizing the country ’ s health regulations will allow mail order for all approved medications starting on january 1 , 2004 .
the european court of justice handed down its ruling in relation to a lawsuit brought by the deutscher apothekerverband -lrb- dav -rrb- , an association of german pharmacists , against the dutch pharmacy docmorris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescriptions online could revolutionize the distribution of medicine .
since june 2000 , docmorris has been selling prescription and non-prescription medicines over the internet , targeting german consumers in particular . consumers are able to contact health experts on the site ’ s “ internet pharmacy , ” or ask drug-related questions via phone or mail . the dav claimed that the service ran contrary to germany ’ s laws on the regulation and advertising of medicinal products .
victory for both sides both the dav and docmorris said they are satisfied with the court ’ s ruling .
according to docmorris , the court acted to protect the free movement of goods , as well as the health of consumers . the dutch company is planning its expansion in the german market , and foresees opening a german production center to cut transportation costs . the company ’ s president , ralf däinghaus , recently told the german economic magazine “ junge karriere ” that in five years ’ time , “ docmorris will have half a billion euros in turnover and be the biggest pharmacy in germany . ” even though most german media see the ruling as a defeat for german pharmacists , dav chairman hermann s. keller welcomed the court ’ s view that a ban on mail order sale of prescription drugs is justified . however , keller criticized “ the impatience of german lawmakers , ” who he said have unnecessarily liberalized the regulations on mail order drugs . “ as of next year , the sale of medicines through mail order might be allowed , but economically , it ’ s not going to be of any interest , ” keller said , adding that many drugs are set to go down in price next year , and that consumers still value the quality and service benefits of going to a traditional pharmacy . can internet pharmacies deliver ?

"
germany 's king of late night tv , harald schmidt , is living proof that germans can be funny .
but now that " the harald schmidt show " is being shelved , germans are wondering if there 's anyone out there to fill his shoes . it 's no secret that " the harald schmidt show " is in many ways a carbon copy of america 's " the late show with david letterman , " but on the barren german comedy landscape , schmidt is unique . the news that , after eight successful years , schmidt is leaving the late-night lineup has unleashed a wave of mourning , with one viewer saying that , once the final show airs on dec .
23 , he may as well put his telelvision set on the junk-heap . at first glance , " the harald schmidt show " appears to be a poor imitation of letterman 's show : there 's the show 's own band playing the intro music , the over-the-top introduction of the host , followed by some stand-up schtick and a celebrity interview session on the couch , complete with cityscape back-drop .
the most apparent difference is that letterman lands more famous guests . schmidt even bears a slight similarity to letterman in his appearance . a suit and tie are de rigeur , round glasses give him an equally impish look , even the hand gestures are the same .
all that 's missing is letterman 's gap-toothed grin . all the news that 's fit for playmobils but german audiences soon began to recognize that schmidt had his own unique brand of intelligent , irreverent humor .
his show was a political-correctness-free zone , a fast-paced mixture of cynicism and slapstick .
they lapped up the gags , such as the naming of the " darling of the month , " or the presentation of world events in brief using playmobil figures . and they forgave him for the gags that went awry , such as the time schmidt did an entire show in french without subtitles , or the " radio-version " of the show during which viewers sat through the whole hour with no pictures on their screens . schmidt 's sabbatical so why is germany 's undisputed king of late night television abdicating the throne ? the word from schmidt is that he needs to take a " creative break . " but it could also be the result of major changes at his parent station .
schmidt routinely cracks jokes at the expense of haim saban , the new owner of show 's broadcaster , prosiebensat.1. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prosiebensat.1 ceo , haim saban .
as part of a corporate reshuffle , saban removed sat.1 chief martin hoffmann , a personal friend of schmidt 's and put roger schawinski in charge . the outpouring of dismay across germany at the prospect of a schmidt-less future has forced schawinski to announce that sat.1 will continue to broadcast reruns of the show even after schmidt 's departure , but only until a host for a new late night show has been found . the search for schmidt 's successor could take a while , and schawinski does n't want to risk losing the loyal following that schmidt cultivated .
" when a unique show on the television landscape runs for eight years in a stable slot , you get ritualized viewing from audiences , " said schawinski .
" we want to make sure our new show latches on to that following . " offers pouring in meanwhile , speculation abounds about schmidt 's future . if germany 's funniest man is n't back on television screens soon , it wo n't be for lack of offers . the nation 's public television stations are falling over themselves to woo the star , offering to work him into existing shows or to create new formats for him . schmidt is so far keeping mum on what he has planned for his creative pause .
whether he 'll work on projects with his own production company , bonito tv , or go back to drinking a beer at mid-day followed by a nap - as was his habit before his show went five days a week - is for now , known only to the man himself . but one thing is certain , should he decide to return to the small screen , comedy-starved viewers will welcome him back with open arms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bridging the transatlantic comedy divide one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .

president toledo had reportedly disagreed with dr merino over new appointments after several cabinet posts became vacant in november .
the move comes after days of sustained criticism of the prime minister in local news media .
dr merino is visiting the united states and is expected to return on sunday .
a statement by the president 's office said a new cabinet would be sworn in on dr merino 's return .
the prime minister currently enjoys approval ratings of over 50 % , compared with under 20 % for president toledo .
loss of confidence correspondents say dr merino is seen as key to helping mr toledo reform peru 's weak institutions , improve tax collection and drive economic growth .
but local media reported that she lost the president 's confidence after publicly complaining about an alleged smear campaign against her involving accusations that she was a lesbian - which she says are untrue - and that she found government jobs for several friends .
" dr merino is out of the government .
as soon as she gets back she will be replaced , " said newspaper editor augusto alvarez in a radio interview .
but the news magazine caretas suggested that the prime minister 's popularity might have sparked envy among political rivals , and even the president himself .

a test which can be carried out on tumour tissue removed from the breast detects a chemical linked to the speed the tumour has been growing .
researchers from the mrc cancer cell unit at cambridge university say the technique could help doctors give women the right level of treatment .
dr nick coleman said that the finding was " good news " for women .
the research , published in the journal of clinical oncology , focuses on a cell protein called mcm-2 , which can be found in breast tumours .
the first step in breast cancer treatment is to take a tiny tissue sample to diagnose the disease , and this could be tested at the same time for this chemical .
lower doses different tumours have different levels of mcm-2 , and scientists worked out that those with certain levels tended to grow more quickly , and require higher doses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy , or a course of treatment that lasts longer .
conversely , mcm-2 levels could also be linked to a slow-growing tumour which perhaps might need a shorter course of treatment or a lower dose .
' great potential ' dr coleman said : " an accurate assessment of the outcome following surgery is key to choosing how much further therapy is needed for an individual patient .
" it is important that patients receive neither too little nor too much additional treatment for their tumours .
" the discovery has the potential to make a difference to the lives of thousands of women as breast cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect women in the uk . "
professor robert souhami , from cancer research uk , one of the research funders , said that the findings would hopefully prove " helpful " to doctors trying to work out how intensively to treat breast cancer patients .
however , he said that further research was now required to validate the results .

dr nick coleman said that the finding was " good news " for women .
the research , published in the journal of clinical oncology , focuses on a cell protein called mcm-2 , which can be found in breast tumours .
the first step in breast cancer treatment is to take a tiny tissue sample to diagnose the disease , and this could be tested at the same time for this chemical .
lower doses different tumours have different levels of mcm-2 , and scientists worked out that those with certain levels tended to grow more quickly , and require higher doses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy , or a course of treatment that lasts longer .
conversely , mcm-2 levels could also be linked to a slow-growing tumour which perhaps might need a shorter course of treatment or a lower dose .
' great potential ' dr coleman said : " an accurate assessment of the outcome following surgery is key to choosing how much further therapy is needed for an individual patient .
" it is important that patients receive neither too little nor too much additional treatment for their tumours .
" the discovery has the potential to make a difference to the lives of thousands of women as breast cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect women in the uk . "
professor robert souhami , from cancer research uk , one of the research funders , said that the findings would hopefully prove " helpful " to doctors trying to work out how intensively to treat breast cancer patients .
however , he said that further research was now required to validate the results .

but it is quite another thing to help local people figure out what to do with the technology once they get it .
for some development activists who attended the un world summit on the information society in geneva , the question was not going online , but about the content on the web .
" if a person comes up to the terminal and there is nothing there in their language that is relevant to their lives , then why should they bother ? " said peter armstrong , director of oneworld.net , a leading website for development issues .
" that is what we are focusing on , tools that allow them to input their own local content in their own local language , at no cost .
" let 's give them the tools they need to provide the information services that will actually make a difference in their lives , " he said .
technology tools oneworld.net is partnering with local groups in developing countries to try to do just that .
in nairobi , kenya , they are working with afriafya , a local group that focuses on health issues .
afriafya 's nancy ndongo says that kenya 's rural populations used to have to work hard to share the information they needed .
" they would have to walk from one person to the other .
mail is not possible because the postal service is very poor in these areas .
" with computers , with these technologies , it 's a lot faster , " she said .
the result is that many of these communities can use the internet to share information vital to their survival .
" it is about hiv and aids affecting the communities , health issues that are specific in those communities .
" even jobs and agriculture we get from the communities .
and also about cultural and traditional beliefs , we get from the communities , " she said .
similar local content projects are under way in places like brazil , bangladesh and el salvador .
in south america 's andean region , one group is working to make people self-sufficient in sharing their information .
" what they need is space to communicate , to express their ideas and their voices , " said ana maria ponce , who works with infoandina in lima , peru .
infoandina uses computers and the internet to help local farmers share information about conservation and resource management amongst themselves .
" my job is not to provide the content .
i think they have a lot of content to provide and they are responsible for their own empowerment .
" what they need is the skill to develop the content , " she explained .
big problems at the opening of the geneva digital divide summit , un secretary general kofi annan talked about this so-called content divide between richer and poorer nations .
he noted that nearly 70 % of all websites are in english , which can crowd out local content and views .
in african countries , a south african organisation called direqlearn is working to address that imbalance .
direqlearn provides customised educational tools to hundreds of schools in namibia , nigeria and south africa .
the idea , says direqlearn 's leonard tleane , is to give students the knowledge they want , in a language that they can understand .
" when we go to western africa we use french , in east africa we use ki-swahili .
so that people can understand it because it is very difficult for them to understand what is happening .
" they feel ashamed to use the technology .
they do n't understand how it works , " he said .
given africa 's problems , mr tleane believes the youth need access to good information more than ever before .
" africa is in deep trouble .
we 've got malaria , we 've got hiv and we 've got crime and all these things , " he said .
" but all this information is on the internet .
if you can get this technology to them , they can learn about what 's happening out in the world .
" this technology can help them know what 's happening and how to look after themselves . "
the last thing the youth need , added mr tleane , is to see a computer screen filled with nothing but pop-up ads , and offers to download the latest single by britney spears .
