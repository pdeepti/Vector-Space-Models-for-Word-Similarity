the events were part of a world-wide protest that included between six and eleven million people in 600 cities , ranging in latitude from canberra , australia , to reykjavik , iceland .
the day 's largest protest was held in rome where , according to conservative estimates , more than three million people took to the streets .
nearly as many gathered at protests across spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london protest in london , an estimated 1.5 million demonstrators turned out to contest prime minister tony blair 's pro-american iraq policies .
speaking at hyde park , london mayor ken livingstone accused u.s. president george w. bush of warmongering .
" this war is solely about oil .
george bush has never given a damn about human rights , " he said .
at a 100,000 person strong rally in new york , south african archbishop and nobel laureate desmond tutu , plead for bush and the security council to allow inspectors to continue their work .
" the just war says you have exhausted all possible and peaceful means , and the world says , ' no , we have n't . " '
marchers in new york even carried signs that read : " thank you france and germany . "
largely , the rallies were peaceful , but in athens police fired tear gas at anarchist protesters .

prior to the rally , beer defended germany 's position in a speech .
" if going out into the streets with millions of people around the world is ' isolation , ' then that 's an alliance we feel good about , " she said .

friedbert pflüger , the christian democratic union 's foreign policy spokesman , said it was a " disgrace " that the president of the bundestag took part in the protest .

the number of people watching boxing and rugby league on television has dropped by a third during the past seven years , a survey carried out by mori suggests .
the reason for the decline is said to be the growing number of matches being shown exclusively on digital channels , to which only two out of every five people have access .
the survey also reveals the number of people playing sport has dropped . "
two out of every five people use or are members of a gym " mori head of mori 's sport research peter hasler said : " this is a worrying trend for sport and its sponsors . "
the only sport to have increased its television audience is football .
televised soccer is watched by 42 % of people , a 4 % rise .
and three out of every five of them are male .
the percentage of people playing sport has also dropped , the mori poll of 2,167 adults suggests .
play golf the number of people playing rugby league has plummeted by 10 % .
and snooker has experienced a decline of 9 % that means only one out of every 20 people now pick up a cue - the same proportion that play golf .
once again , though , football has avoided the decline .
one out of every 10 people still play .
leisure pursuits and swimming has seen a 33 % rise , making it the most popular participation sport .
one out of every five people - and more than one out of every four of the women asked - now enjoy a dip .

but the lavish celebrations were accompanied by a call to the military to be on high alert - the communist state is locked in a deepening stand-off with the united states .
all party members and workers must burn with hatred and hostility in their hearts toward us imperialists rodong sinmun newspaper parades , flower shows -lrb- featuring the flower named after him -rrb- , concerts and firework displays have been held around the country .
the celebrations were held despite a serious economic crisis , in which many people are reported to have starved to death .
pyongyang has engaged in an escalating war of words with washington since october , when reports emerged that it had restarted its nuclear programme .
kimjongilia kim jong-il 's birthday is a national holiday in north korea , and people have long been preparing for the country 's most important event .
kim is reportedly grooming his successor on tuesday , about 50,000 gathered in pyongyang to pledge their allegiance to mr kim , known as the dear leader .
during the main festivities which started at the weekend , generals read poems hailing the leader and the army organised huge fireworks displays .
newsreaders on state television provided running commentaries for the event .
as part of the celebrations , an exhibition of 30,000 flowers - all of one variety - has opened in pyongyang .
the kimjongilia flowers are named after mr kim , and a number of government departments and army units have been reportedly competing to make the best bouquet arrangements .
government officials also have been visiting a log-cabin on paektu mountain - a purported birthplace of mr kim , although western historians say kim jong-il was born in russia 's far east .
mr kim came to power in 1994 after the death of his father , kim il-sung , and a huge cult of personality has been built up around them .
until three years ago he remained one of the world 's most reclusive leaders - rarely seen , let alone heard in public .
that changed when he held a historic summit with south korean president kim dae-jung , and hosted a visit by former us secretary of state madeleine albright .
earlier this year , japanese media reported that mr kim 's second son , 21-year-old kim jong chul , is being groomed as his successor , ready to continue the communist dynasty .
festivities overshadowed this year 's celebrations come amid a growing crisis over north korea 's nuclear programme .
the youths pledged their allegiance to the great leader last week , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- referred north korea to the united nations security council for breaking its nuclear agreements .
the state-run newspaper rodong sinmun , monitored by the south korean yonhap news agency , accused the us of pushing the dispute with pyongyang " to the brink of war " .
" all servicemen of the korea people 's army should always be on the alert , " the newspaper 's editorial said .
" all party members and workers must burn with hatred and hostility in their hearts toward us imperialists .
