the ministry ’ s policy of promising troops to such operations now appears to stretch to the planned rapid reaction force which will mean troops attached to the nato brigade will be required to be on call indefinitely under the mandate that it should be capable of deploying within days to any crisis zone in the world . the pledge of troops for the nato force appears to be the latest step in the bundeswehr ’ s restructuring plans which include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments . at the moment , iraq does not feature as one of those possible deployments .

now apparently continuing the country ’ s changing role , germany ’ s defense ministry has reportedly decided that it is ready to contribute more than 5,000 soldiers to a planned nato rapid reaction force , the daily berliner zeitung newspaper said on monday . a ministry spokesman refused to comment on the report , but government sources quoted in the newspaper said that germany ’ s contribution would include bundeswehr -lrb- army -rrb- units specialized in detecting nuclear , biological or chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- weapons as well as minesweepers and six tornado warplanes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nbc units are to be deployed .

the ministry ’ s policy of promising troops to such operations now appears to stretch to the planned rapid reaction force which will mean troops attached to the nato brigade will be required to be on call indefinitely under the mandate that it should be capable of deploying within days to any crisis zone in the world . the pledge of troops for the nato force appears to be the latest step in the bundeswehr ’ s restructuring plans which include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments . at the moment , iraq does not feature as one of those possible deployments .
but if the united nations takes on a greater role in the country ’ s postwar reconstruction , nato – and therefore germany – could be called upon to send peacekeeping troops to relieve the overstretched u.s. and british coalition forces . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de overburdened german army not likely to head to iraq after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities .

now apparently continuing the country ’ s changing role , germany ’ s defense ministry has reportedly decided that it is ready to contribute more than 5,000 soldiers to a planned nato rapid reaction force , the daily berliner zeitung newspaper said on monday . a ministry spokesman refused to comment on the report , but government sources quoted in the newspaper said that germany ’ s contribution would include bundeswehr -lrb- army -rrb- units specialized in detecting nuclear , biological or chemical -lrb- nbc -rrb- weapons as well as minesweepers and six tornado warplanes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nbc units are to be deployed .

the ministry ’ s policy of promising troops to such operations now appears to stretch to the planned rapid reaction force which will mean troops attached to the nato brigade will be required to be on call indefinitely under the mandate that it should be capable of deploying within days to any crisis zone in the world . the pledge of troops for the nato force appears to be the latest step in the bundeswehr ’ s restructuring plans which include modernizing the army , trimming the number of civilian jobs while at the same time increasing the number of soldiers -lrb- from 282,000 to 300,000 -rrb- , slashing military spending and training troops to gear up for new military challenges , including foreign deployments . at the moment , iraq does not feature as one of those possible deployments .

it is aimed at protecting older people from so-called " cowboys " who charge huge sums for shoddy work .
more than 50 traders have signed up for the home maintenance register , the first of its kind in devon .
if the scheme is successful it will be rolled out across the south west .
strict criteria unlike other schemes , the companies do not have to put money in to join , but do have to meet strict criteria .
richard green from torbay trading standards is monitoring the scheme .
he said : " the traders have to want to be on the scheme , it 's not just a case of a trader being able to pay a registration fee .
" i have spoken to a number on the scheme and they feel it is good that trading standards are involved because we are good at identifying the bad boys . "
councillor colin charlwood , from torbay council , said : " there have been many reports of elderly people being approached by conmen , so anything that is going to prevent that is a marvellous thing . "

lord cavendish , whose stately home is holker hall in south cumbria , has shut off access to foreshore areas owned by his estates near flookburgh .
lord cavendish says he has taken the decision after a rise in the number of people from britain and abroad taking up cockling .
lord cavendish said : " i have been upset and angered by the unscrupulous nature of over fishing of the cockle beds and the mess which is being left behind .
" i have reacted to the wishes of local fishermen who have plied their trade here for centuries with the permission of my family . "
unscrupulous cocklers gates which lead onto the sands of morecambe bay have been closed on the orders of lord cavendish , whose home is often used by members of the royal family for private stays .
no-one can now go past the gates without prior permission of holker estates .
lord cavendish claims some unscrupulous cocklers along the cumbria coastlines often earn up to £ 1000 a week .
cockles are loaded direct onto ships in morecambe bay or onto articulated vehicles and taken abroad .
some cocklers , who are known to be claiming state benefits , have been the subject of raids by government fraud investigation teams and officers investigating illegal immigrants .
lord cavendish said his action was designed to protect beds off flookburgh for local fishermen .

lord cavendish , whose stately home is holker hall in south cumbria , has shut off access to foreshore areas owned by his estates near flookburgh .
lord cavendish says he has taken the decision after a rise in the number of people from britain and abroad taking up cockling .
lord cavendish said : " i have been upset and angered by the unscrupulous nature of over fishing of the cockle beds and the mess which is being left behind .
" i have reacted to the wishes of local fishermen who have plied their trade here for centuries with the permission of my family . "
unscrupulous cocklers gates which lead onto the sands of morecambe bay have been closed on the orders of lord cavendish , whose home is often used by members of the royal family for private stays .
no-one can now go past the gates without prior permission of holker estates .
lord cavendish claims some unscrupulous cocklers along the cumbria coastlines often earn up to £ 1000 a week .
cockles are loaded direct onto ships in morecambe bay or onto articulated vehicles and taken abroad .
some cocklers , who are known to be claiming state benefits , have been the subject of raids by government fraud investigation teams and officers investigating illegal immigrants .
lord cavendish said his action was designed to protect beds off flookburgh for local fishermen .
