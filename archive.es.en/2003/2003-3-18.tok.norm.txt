kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .
and that comes across when we play live . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .
he was extradited from the philippines in 2001 after being on the run for four years . le floch-prigent is also serving a 30-month prison sentence , despite his denials that he was aware of sirven 's doings or of his former deputy ’ s arrangements with deviers-joncour . elf was privatized in 1994 .
in 2000 , it became part of the multinational oil company totalfinaelf , which has planned to change its name to total .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .
the prosecution alleges elf officials gave african politicians cash for every barrel of oil extracted in their operations . implications for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter holzer german lobbyist dieter holzer -lrb- photo -rrb- is among the suspects because of his role in the sale of the former east german oil refinery leuna to elf in 1992 . sirven reportedly claimed that elf paid holzer some dm100 million -lrb- $ 51 million at today 's rate -rrb- in commissions in the early 1990s , but that he had no idea what holzer did with the money . holzer has rejected allegations that some of it went to christian democratic union politicians to approve the sale of leuna , a publicly owned oil refinery . but elf middleman andré guelfi , who also faces charges in the trial , has told prosecutors that the millions were meant to " grease the political machinery in germany . " prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .
he was extradited from the philippines in 2001 after being on the run for four years . le floch-prigent is also serving a 30-month prison sentence , despite his denials that he was aware of sirven 's doings or of his former deputy ’ s arrangements with deviers-joncour . elf was privatized in 1994 .
in 2000 , it became part of the multinational oil company totalfinaelf , which has planned to change its name to total .
the company is now negotiating multi-billion dollar deals with iraq . a ruling is expected in july . if convicted , the suspects would face up to 10 years in prison . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an oily scandal a seven-year probe into former french oil company elf-aquitaine has brought forth a wide-reaching maze of high-level corruption .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.03.2003 german court throws out attempt to ban right-wing party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching for their cause : npd members protest in potsdam last november .
federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.03.2003 german court throws out attempt to ban right-wing party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching for their cause : npd members protest in potsdam last november .
federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?

but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .

it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .
he was extradited from the philippines in 2001 after being on the run for four years . le floch-prigent is also serving a 30-month prison sentence , despite his denials that he was aware of sirven 's doings or of his former deputy ’ s arrangements with deviers-joncour . elf was privatized in 1994 .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .

noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.03.2003 german court throws out attempt to ban right-wing party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marching for their cause : npd members protest in potsdam last november .
federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

former german chancellor helmut schmidt has taken the bull by the horns in a controversial book where he calls germans xenophobic at heart .
his comments have touched a raw nerve and kicked up a row among politicians .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .
the prosecution alleges elf officials gave african politicians cash for every barrel of oil extracted in their operations . implications for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter holzer german lobbyist dieter holzer -lrb- photo -rrb- is among the suspects because of his role in the sale of the former east german oil refinery leuna to elf in 1992 . sirven reportedly claimed that elf paid holzer some dm100 million -lrb- $ 51 million at today 's rate -rrb- in commissions in the early 1990s , but that he had no idea what holzer did with the money . holzer has rejected allegations that some of it went to christian democratic union politicians to approve the sale of leuna , a publicly owned oil refinery . but elf middleman andré guelfi , who also faces charges in the trial , has told prosecutors that the millions were meant to " grease the political machinery in germany . " prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .
he was extradited from the philippines in 2001 after being on the run for four years . le floch-prigent is also serving a 30-month prison sentence , despite his denials that he was aware of sirven 's doings or of his former deputy ’ s arrangements with deviers-joncour . elf was privatized in 1994 .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .
" mr. beckstein and mr. schily carry a large amount of the blame , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the small free democratic party . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government under fire for neo-nazi informants in the latest scandal involving the domestic intelligence agency 's use of informants , reports allege the government looked the other way as two extremist spooks produced a cd inciting the murder of prominent german jews .

former german chancellor helmut schmidt has taken the bull by the horns in a controversial book where he calls germans xenophobic at heart .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .
i ’ m no jimi hendrix , but i know that i could play guitar in any band in the world .
and that comes across when we play live . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .
he had previously been sentenced to 212 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of 1 million french francs -lrb- € 152,000 -rrb- for having profited from millions of euros in payments that his mistress , christine deviers-joncour , received from the oil company .
an appeals court overturned the decision on the grounds he was unaware the money had come from elf . deviers-joncour , who dubbed herself " the whore of the republic " in her first book , was sentenced to 30 months in prison for her role in the affair .
the former lingerie model was employed by sirven and drew a salary of millions , allegedly to make sure dumas favored elf . sirven , who kept deviers-joncour on the elf payroll and orchestrated her activities , is now serving a three-year jail sentence .

federal constitutional court justices ruled on tuesday that the use of informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the national democratic party .
a new effort to ban the party is unlikely . chancellor gerhard schröder originally saw the idea as a simple " bit of political hygiene . "
he and other german leaders would ask the country 's highest court to ban the right-wing extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- as a way of removing some unsightly litter from the country 's political landscape .
but schröder 's scrubbing action soon got bogged down in a legal mess of its own .
after filing the petition in 2001 , officials eventually had to concede that their case was based in part on statements made by government informants who were members of the party 's leadership .
on tuesday , the german constitutional court threw out schröder 's effort because of the government 's infiltration of the party .
the question before the court was actually a procedural one : should the court continue to consider the case ?
to push it forward , a two-thirds majority of the seven judges would have had to vote yes .
but only four supported a continuation of the case .
" the state 's presence in the party 's leadership makes its participation in the development of political positions and activities unavoidable , " said justice winfried hassemer , who was among the three justices who voted no .
but hassemer said the decision had nothing to do with the main issue of whether the party deserved to be banned .
two parties were banned in the past in germany , a political party can be banned if the court determines that the group is a threat to the country 's democratic order or seeks to overturn that order .
in the nearly 54-year history of the federal republic of germany , the court has banned only two parties .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , in which former nazis had collected , and it forced the communist party of germany to disband in 1956 .
the push to ban the npd began in august 2000 following several weeks of highly publicized cases of right-wing violence , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein including the killing of the african alberto adriano in the eastern city of dessau .
in august , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- , interior minister of the state of bavaria , called on the federal government to begin preparing the application , citing the growing number of violent skinheads and neo-nazis who he said were joining the party .
schröder soon joined the effort , and eventually all major parts of the country 's government - the cabinet , the legislature and the states - filed petitions with the court in karlsruhe .
the effort was directed at a party that was founded in 1964 by a number of right-wing groups .
a position statement on the party 's web site once said the party opposed such things as " domination by outsiders , " and favored " a new social order in germany that corresponds with our view of mankind . "
the party has about 6,500 members and won 0.4 percent of the vote during the sept .
22 national election .
no second effort planned beckstein said on tuesday that he was disappointed by the decision .
" it limits the action that a democracy can take to defend itself from parties that oppose the constitution , " he said .
despite his disappointment , beckstein said he would not make another attempt to the ban the npd .
one of beckstein 's political opponents saw the decision as a " legal and political disaster , " and blamed him and the federal interior minister , otto schily , for it .

the biggest trial in postwar french history opens in paris as 37 suspects face charges of profiting from corruption and illegal kickbacks in the early 1990s in conjunction with the french oil company elf-aquitaine . after more than eight years of investigation , 37 defendants accused of having taken part in a worldwide net of corruption involving the former french oil giant elf-aquitaine went on trial on monday in paris . the suspects , who include top french executives with close ties to the country ’ s political elite , are said to have been involved in misappropriating at least € 183 million -lrb- $ 197 million -rrb- to use as bribes to secure elf business contracts in africa , south america , russia , spain and germany between 1989 and 1993 .
elf executives are also suspected of having embezzled some of the funds . the trial is one of the first steps in revealing a system that allowed french governments to turn elf into an extension of the country ’ s foreign-policy machine .
at the time of the alleged misconduct , elf was france 's biggest company and was controlled by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loik le floch-prigent former elf director general loik le floch-prigent , 59 , -lrb- photo -rrb- and his one-time deputy , the 76-year-old alfred sirven , are believed to have played key roles in the scandal .
investigators suspect that the majority of the funds , € 168 million , was transferred via sirven 's foreign bank accounts and slush funds , although investigators have been unable to locate all of the misappropriated millions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre tarallo andré tarallo -lrb- photo -rrb- , known as elf 's mr. africa during the administration of president françois mitterrand , is also a defendant .

" prelude in january in january 2003 , a court of appeals acquitted former french foreign minister roland dumas , 80 , on charges of accepting funds embezzled from elf .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.03.2003 an interview with oasis ' noel gallagher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noel gallagher back after a hotel brawl forced them to cancel dates last december , british band oasis rolled into germany for a string of gigs this week .
noel gallagher talks to dw-world about music and ' stupid little boys in bars . ' after an incident in a munich hotel in december left singer liam gallagher in police custody and missing his front teeth , british rock band oasis cancelled the remainder of their german tour dates amidst familiar controversy .
on saturday , oasis finally resumed the german leg of its tour , and the band 's main creative force and lead guitarist , noel gallagher , took time out from a sound check at munich 's zenith venue to talk to dw-world about germany , the tour and the now infamous hotel brawl .
the crowd at your last concert in düsseldorf was extremely enthusiastic .
how do audiences in germany compare to others around the world ?
well , i never compare them because they ’ re all different - the australians , the swiss , the miserable dutch - but that was a particularly lively german crowd , i must say .
these aren ’ t small gigs we ’ re playing here .
there ’ s this idea that we ’ re big in britain and nowhere else .
this is not the first time a band has had to reschedule a concert , but in your own experience , when it happens , do you feel you owe the fans more when you come back ?
no .
this is rock ' n ' roll , not a charity handout .
i don ’ t care who you are , why you ’ re here , what you expect .
if you buy the ticket then you ’ re going to get the show we put on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you know what you can do .
the last time you were in munich , the international press had a field day over the hotel incident .
why do you think the press continue to focus on the negative things that happen around the band ?
you mean the stuff that happens around liam ?
it ’ s all about alcohol and stupid little boys in bars - and it sells papers .
the press say they love to hate us , but in reality they love to love us .
the sad thing is that when they look back over 2002 , what they will remember oasis for is not the fact that we sold over 3 million records last year or that i nearly died in a car crash , they ’ ll remember liam getting his teeth smashed in .
in an interview you gave last september , you made several references to wanting to distance yourself from the bad boy image .
does it frustrate you when liam or the others get themselves into situations that reinforce that image ?
yeah , it does .
you can ’ t keep that up at 35 .
i see myself having another five years in the band and then i ’ ll do something else .
i think it ’ s sad when you ’ re 40 and you ’ re still pretending to be a gang .
i won ’ t be doing this when i ’ m 41 .
only the rolling stones are doing it and they haven ’ t done anything good since 1971 .
i can ’ t see myself doing that .
as for liam in spandex , leaping around like mick jagger , i think he really is sad enough to still be doing that when he ’ s middle-aged .
let ’ s get onto the music .
what ’ s next for oasis ?
don ’ t expect too much .
there ’ ll be another album , but i don ’ t know when .
after this tour , i ’ m going to go home and have a normal life .
these shows we ’ re doing now should have been done in the summer .
we ’ ve rescheduled these dates twice now and to tell you the truth , i need a break from the band and a break from music .
we should have finished in melbourne but what with one thing or another we had to come back .
so i ’ m up for a rest .
the others will probably go back in the studio , they don ’ t need me around anymore to do that .
live on stage , oasis look and sound leaner and fitter .
the latest line up seems to be going from strength to strength .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liam gallagher and rhythm guitarist paul " bonehead " arthurs someone just told me that we ’ ve been together since 1999 , two more years and it ’ ll be longer than the original lineup .
the thing is that we ’ re all very talented musicians .
we all know we can do it and that makes a difference .
with gem -lrb- archer -rrb- and andy -lrb- bell -rrb- on board , we ’ re all very good at what we do .

a group of crofters on the galson estate in the north of the island of lewis is planning to launch a community buyout .
it is set to leaflet every household in the area canvassing opinion .
the move follows the passing of the land reform bill by the scottish parliament in january .
right to buy it gave crofting communities the right to buy their own land .
this was an outcome described by the conservatives as a " mugabe-style land grab " .
the 55,000 acre galson estate is home to about 3,000 people .
it is owned by a local family , the grahams , most of whom live on the island .
tenants pay peppercorn rents and say they have no problems working with the landowners .
annual rent the graham family do not want to sell .
but a group of crofters is planning to use new legislation to force them to sell their land .
crofter james macdonald believes the land should belong to the people who stay there and work there .
" i would certainly like my sons to stay and i 'm sure they would as well , " he said .
" but as so very often happens they do n't see any future in the place for them , there 's so little work . "
" basically it 's got a lot of people thinking if there is going to be benefits to the islands , why should n't the crofters and the residents of galson estate get the full benefit ? "
calum iain macleod , councillor the new owners of the land could be in line for an annual income of tens of thousands of pounds if plans for a windfarm on the island go ahead .
amec and british energy want to develop the largest windfarm in europe on lewis , with 250 to 300 windmills .
the energy companies would pay an annual rent , thought to be about £ 1,000 per turbine , to the owner of land on which windmills are situated .
local councillor calum iain macleod supports a buyout .
" basically it 's got a lot of people thinking if there is going to be benefits to the islands , why should n't the crofters and the residents of galson estate get the full benefit ? " he said .
community questions however , much of the community remains to be convinced and leaflets will now be delivered in a bid to persuade them to own the land they live on .
katie mackenzie is a councillor for the port of ness area at the northern of the estate .
she believes it is unfortunate that the questions of the windfarm and a community buyout have been linked .
" i 'm not sure that everyone wants to have a buyout , " she said .
" the galson estate has been a very good landlord to us and there are many unresolved questions , questions that have to be resolved before people agree . "

a group of crofters on the galson estate in the north of the island of lewis is planning to launch a community buyout .
it is set to leaflet every household in the area canvassing opinion .
the move follows the passing of the land reform bill by the scottish parliament in january .
right to buy it gave crofting communities the right to buy their own land .
this was an outcome described by the conservatives as a " mugabe-style land grab " .
the 55,000 acre galson estate is home to about 3,000 people .
it is owned by a local family , the grahams , most of whom live on the island .
tenants pay peppercorn rents and say they have no problems working with the landowners .
annual rent the graham family do not want to sell .
but a group of crofters is planning to use new legislation to force them to sell their land .
crofter james macdonald believes the land should belong to the people who stay there and work there .
" i would certainly like my sons to stay and i 'm sure they would as well , " he said .
" but as so very often happens they do n't see any future in the place for them , there 's so little work . "
basically it 's got a lot of people thinking if there is going to be benefits to the islands , why should n't the crofters and the residents of galson estate get the full benefit ?
calum iain macleod , councillor the new owners of the land could be in line for an annual income of tens of thousands of pounds if plans for a windfarm on the island go ahead .
amec and british energy want to develop the largest windfarm in europe on lewis , with 250 to 300 windmills .
the energy companies would pay an annual rent , thought to be about £ 1,000 per turbine , to the owner of land on which windmills are situated .

the kirk has confirmed that it will decide which homes stay open when its current review of services ends in june .
church leaders said they were still experiencing financial difficulties despite closing four residential homes last year .
kirk director of social work ian manson said : " we have set up a review group which is examining a range of issues , including finance , human resources , property , registration and local supply and demand .
financial constraints " this review incorporates a consultation process with our staff , service users , kirk presbyteries and other relevant groups such as individual local authorities .
" when the review , which began in november , is completed , the board will then have some extremely difficult decisions to make about which homes will close and which ones can continue or be redeveloped within available financial constraints . "
the kirk announced last april that it was closing five residential homes accommodating 125 elderly people , although rubislaw park house in aberdeen was given a last-minute reprieve after discussions with the city council .
a national review group , which included the scottish executive , cosla , scottish care , the church of scotland and salvation army , agreed in 2001 that care home fees should be raised from £ 295 to £ 390 per week .
new funding deal the scottish executive increased the figure to £ 332 this year but the kirk insisted that the sum was " way too short " of what was required .
the executive last year said it was " disappointed " with the kirk 's decision , pointing out it had invested more than £ 50m in the care home sector .
last week scottish care , which runs more than 800 private homes , warned that it would close its doors to new admissions after rejecting a new funding deal .
the group unanimously rejected a " take-it-or-leave it " deal from the scottish executive and the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- .

" when the review , which began in november , is completed , the board will then have some extremely difficult decisions to make about which homes will close and which ones can continue or be redeveloped within available financial constraints . "
the kirk announced last april that it was closing five residential homes accommodating 125 elderly people , although rubislaw park house in aberdeen was given a last-minute reprieve after discussions with the city council .
a national review group , which included the scottish executive , cosla , scottish care , the church of scotland and salvation army , agreed in 2001 that care home fees should be raised from £ 295 to £ 390 per week .
new funding deal the scottish executive increased the figure to £ 332 this year but the kirk insisted that the sum was " way too short " of what was required .
the executive last year said it was " disappointed " with the kirk 's decision , pointing out it had invested more than £ 50m in the care home sector .
last week scottish care , which runs more than 800 private homes , warned that it would close its doors to new admissions after rejecting a new funding deal .
the group unanimously rejected a " take-it-or-leave it " deal from the scottish executive and the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- .
