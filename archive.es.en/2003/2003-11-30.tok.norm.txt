in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2003 germany to face old foes in euro 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler knows what 's coming as soon as germany are drawn against holland in euro 2004 .
old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "

much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal .

it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.11.2003 daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo schrempp will be talking from a very different podium in the next weeks .
in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal .

kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .

kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 30.11.2003 hopes fade as constitution talks hit more obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers choose the next one to raise an objection .
just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .

much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / thierry charlier -rrb- the draft constitution , the document put together by european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- picture -rrb- which has caused such a headache for the italian presidency , would scrap voting weights agreed at nice in 2000 which gave spain and poland 27 votes each in the eu council of ministers , just two less than britain , france , germany and italy , which have far larger populations . in its place , the constitution would allow a vote to be passed if a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population agree . this would give more weight to countries with bigger populations and significantly dilute the influence that spain and poland , who both received voting power greater than the size of their populations , bring to bear in the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future of europe 's diplomatic face entwined with constitution the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .

hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .

kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .

kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .

" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 30.11.2003 hopes fade as constitution talks hit more obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers choose the next one to raise an objection .
just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / thierry charlier -rrb- the draft constitution , the document put together by european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- picture -rrb- which has caused such a headache for the italian presidency , would scrap voting weights agreed at nice in 2000 which gave spain and poland 27 votes each in the eu council of ministers , just two less than britain , france , germany and italy , which have far larger populations . in its place , the constitution would allow a vote to be passed if a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population agree . this would give more weight to countries with bigger populations and significantly dilute the influence that spain and poland , who both received voting power greater than the size of their populations , bring to bear in the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future of europe 's diplomatic face entwined with constitution the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday .

just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / thierry charlier -rrb- the draft constitution , the document put together by european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- picture -rrb- which has caused such a headache for the italian presidency , would scrap voting weights agreed at nice in 2000 which gave spain and poland 27 votes each in the eu council of ministers , just two less than britain , france , germany and italy , which have far larger populations . in its place , the constitution would allow a vote to be passed if a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population agree . this would give more weight to countries with bigger populations and significantly dilute the influence that spain and poland , who both received voting power greater than the size of their populations , bring to bear in the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future of europe 's diplomatic face entwined with constitution the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .

with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.11.2003 daimlerchrysler trial captures industry ’ s imagination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler ceo schrempp will be talking from a very different podium in the next weeks .
in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal .

just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / thierry charlier -rrb- the draft constitution , the document put together by european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- picture -rrb- which has caused such a headache for the italian presidency , would scrap voting weights agreed at nice in 2000 which gave spain and poland 27 votes each in the eu council of ministers , just two less than britain , france , germany and italy , which have far larger populations . in its place , the constitution would allow a vote to be passed if a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population agree . this would give more weight to countries with bigger populations and significantly dilute the influence that spain and poland , who both received voting power greater than the size of their populations , bring to bear in the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future of europe 's diplomatic face entwined with constitution the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "
the latest trial revolving around the daimlerchrysler deal comes only three months after the company settled out of court with a separate group of former investors , who had also claimed daimler-benz had deliberately disguised its intentions , to the tune of $ 300 million in august . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler settles merger suit for $ 300 million on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .
in the european union , the number of votes in eu decision-making a member state has is in direct correlation to the size of its population , thereby giving germany a huge slice of power . favorable to bigger countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing addresses the european convention at the end of the last euro convention session held at the european parliament in brussels , friday june 13 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / thierry charlier -rrb- the draft constitution , the document put together by european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- picture -rrb- which has caused such a headache for the italian presidency , would scrap voting weights agreed at nice in 2000 which gave spain and poland 27 votes each in the eu council of ministers , just two less than britain , france , germany and italy , which have far larger populations . in its place , the constitution would allow a vote to be passed if a majority of countries representing 60 percent of the total eu population agree . this would give more weight to countries with bigger populations and significantly dilute the influence that spain and poland , who both received voting power greater than the size of their populations , bring to bear in the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future of europe 's diplomatic face entwined with constitution the shape of european foreign policy following the passage of the european union 's constitution in the coming year tops the agenda of foreign ministers , who gather in naples on friday .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .
deal claimed to cost shareholders billions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .

just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .
in a move that has been enthusiastically supported by britain , italy recommends that any change to national voting rights within the eu should be delayed until 2009 . it was seen as potential breakthrough in the talks on the bloc 's first constitution won ’ t satisfy everyone and could well be seen as a damaging defeat to germany , which stands to gain most from the reforms included in the proposed constitution because it has the largest population , if goes ahead .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .

in a star-studded trial set to begin on monday , top figures from auto giant daimlerchrysler will take the stand in a u.s. federal court to ascertain whether the deal that created the company was based on lies and deceit . the eyes of the business world will turn to a federal court in wilmington , delaware in the united states on monday when the three-year legal battle over the mega-merger between germany 's daimler-benz and u.s.-based chrysler comes to a dramatic head , five years after the deal went through .
the trial , brought to the court in the form of a lawsuit by billionaire kirk kerkorian , will determine if there was some kind of secret deal between the german and u.s. companies that kerkorian claims duped chrysler shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was the largest shareholder in chrysler at the time with 13.7 percent , believes he and others were led to understand that the 1998 deal was a " merger of equals " rather than a takeover by the german automaker .
allegations of fraud the drama will be increased by the appearance of a number of major players from the business world , including daimlerchrysler chairman jürgen schrempp , the architect of the deal that is at the core of the case .
schrempp will face allegations in the federal court that he lied in a successful bid to convince chrysler shareholders of the nature of the $ 36 billion -lrb- € 30 billion -rrb- deal .
he faces allegations of fraud and a violation of u.s. securities law .
former chrysler chairman robert eaton and former president james holden will also appear as witnesses for kerkorian and his holding company , the tracinda corporation .
although judge joseph farnan has ordered daimlerchrysler chairman schrempp to appear , the exact timing of his courtroom appearance has been left to the discretion of his lawyers with speculation that schrempp will feature in the second week of the trial .
the so-called bench trial will be heard without a jury with judge farnan deciding the verdict at the conclusion which is expected on december 17 .

kerkorian is expected to be among the first witnesses .
the las vegas casino mogul , who has achieved both fame and notoriety for his involvement in the takeovers of mgm studios and trans world airlines , is seeking damages of at least $ 3 billion , alleging that the daimler management team mismanaged the us automaker , cost shareholders billions of dollars and turned the daimlerchrysler into a german company , leaving the struggling chrysler division to be run by executives dispatched from the company ’ s corporate headquarters in stuttgart .
kerkorian filed the lawsuit suit after schrempp told the financial times in october 2000 that it was always his intention to make chrysler a mere division of a new global automotive giant .
" if i had gone and said chrysler would be a division , everybody on their side would have said : ' there is no way we 'll do a deal . '
but it 's precisely what i wanted to do , " he told the business daily at the time .
defense says case will fail michael schell , attorney for daimlerchrysler , issued a statement ahead of the start of the trail in which he said that he believed the suit had no merit and would fail .
" -lrb- the plaintiffs -rrb- are going to have to prove their case , and our position is they 're not going to be able to do that .
they are not going to be able to support the allegations , which we thought were outlandish when they made them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-benz chairman schrempp and chrysler chairman eaton sign the deal but was it all above board ?
" we will demonstrate that daimler-benz and chrysler had an agreement , they wrote it down , and then they went about performing it , " schell said .
" there ’ s not a single thing they promised that they did n't do , and there 's not an agreement somewhere out there in the ether . "
merger would not have gone ahead although kerkorian ’ s lawyer terry christensen has refused to speak about the trial , an official statement from tracinda has argued it would not have agreed to the merger if it had known daimler-benz 's " true intentions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 30.11.2003 hopes fade as constitution talks hit more obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers choose the next one to raise an objection .
just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .

just as it looked like one major problem had been solved at the eu constitution talks in naples on friday , even more surfaced on saturday to leave discussions deadlocked once again . despite moves by the european union ’ s italian presidency to unlock the door to the eu ’ s first constitution by proposing a delay in the voting rights discussion that has dogged the talks , saturday ’ s discussions in naples failed to offer any further hope of a breakthrough . positive noises were being made by italian and british representatives at the foreign ministers meeting on friday after one of the most stubborn points on the agenda looked set to be resolved . however , the optimistic italians , who hoped to all but seal a deal in naples , failed to appreciate the rigidity of many member states on a host of other issues . one solution does not a constitution make bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the draft copy of the european constitution is proving embarrasingly problematic .
with each carrying their own bugbear into the preliminary discussions ahead of what was hoped to be an unveiling of the draft constitution at the next major eu summit in december , one offered solution to one outstanding problem was never going to mean a final conclusion . the next obstacle seems to be the planned removal of the right of national veto in eu decisions on foreign policy along with issues surrounding other " red lines " within the draft such as taxation , social security , the on-going negotiations on defense and the euro-budget . unresolved battles go to next round many of the eu governments presented their own national " no-go " areas and the talks faltered once more with the individual members offering little room for compromise .
much to the dismay of those present , and especially the italians , the big battles will have to be faced when eu leaders meet in brussels next weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is designed to streamline the eu and avoid bureaucratic and political gridlock when it expands next may from 15 to 25 countries .
but the proposals have been greeted by eurosceptics as a federalists ' charter - while federalists say they will still leave too much power for running the eu in national government hands . commission power a sticking point one argument being supported by a number of nations is that eu governments should remain in the driving seat and not cede too much control to the european commission . the commission , meanwhile , is pushing for more authority , and for virtually all eu decisions to be taken by a majority vote of the member states , to avoid one or other country blocking progress because of a narrow national interest . hope shines briefly the eu 's italian presidency proposed on friday what was described as an “ imaginative ” solution to the voting rights argument , one of the most stubborn sticking points in the european draft constitution talks taking place in naples this weekend .

old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d. germany will face the netherlands , czech republic and latvia in the group stages of the european soccer championships in portugal next summer .
it is a dangerous group for rudi völler ’ s men who can expect a difficult time of things against the dutch , one of the favorites for the title and 6-1 destroyers of countryman berti vogts ’ scotland in their play-off match .
rudi himself will have painful memories of the dutch and their former coach frank rijkaard in particular .
when the names came out in the same group , völler ’ s eyes dropped and he granted himself a wry smile .
no doubt he was already reading the future reports which would drag up one of his most distasteful soccer moments .
in the second half of a world cup match between the two countries in italia ’ 90 , the dutch star spat on völler a number of times before the german reacted and was promptly sent off .
rijkaard was not far behind him down the tunnel .
rivalry to be revived in first group match the rivalry will begin again on june 15 2004 when the two teams open their challenges in one of the clashes of the tournament .
this time , however , völler will be safe from any flying phlegm unless current dutch coach dick advocaat has been taking lessons from his predecessor .
" i do n't see starting against holland as a problem because at the european championships everyone is concentrating fully right from the start , " völler told reporters after the draw .
the czech republic will also prove a test for the germans although history is in germany ’ s favor .
in germany ’ s last successful european championship campaign , it was the czechs who succumbed to an oliver bierhoff sudden death overtime goal which earned the germans a 2-1 victory in the final of euro ’ 96 .
" that is without doubt a strong group , " völler added .
" certainly there were quite a few other combinations which would have been much easier on paper .
it was clear beforehand that at this tournament there would be no easy preliminary groups . "
goalkeeper and team captain oliver kahn said , " it is an unbelievably hard group and it looks as if there are three favorites but we must not underestimate the latvians . " " all the teams are enormously strong but of course our clashes with holland are steeped in tradition and it will be an unbelievably explosive tie .
the czechs also have a fantastic team with many players who earn their money in england , germany or holland . "
with critics watching every germany game with pens poised with scorn , the draw for euro 2004 was watched with possibilities of even more speculation of the team ’ s shortcomings just a selection ball away .
hosts to play neighbors in a painfully long ceremony , where a sphere containing the name of the country was drawn first followed by the ball containing the group allocation number , the 16 teams who made it through automatic qualification and play-off victories were split into four groups of four with only one team from each seeding pot in each group .
former portugal star and local hero eusebio helped various uefa dignitaries to execute the lottery style allocation which caused ripples through the crowd of coaches and officials in lisbon when the first group threw the hosts together with their rivals and neighbors spain in group a , along with russia and greece .
france take on england holders france , so disappointing in the defense of their world cup crown in 2002 , were drawn in group b against england , switzerland and croatia .
anyone thinking that the french will collapse as spectacularly in portugal as they did in japan / korea need only to check the statistics to believe that zinedine zidane and friends are once again a force to be reckoned with .
france are not only unbeaten in their last 13 matches but have won them all , including the recent friendly with germany in gelsenkirchen .
italy face scandinavian threat italy , euro 2000 runners-up after a cruel extra-time defeat at the feet of les bleus , have a marginally less difficult group to contend with although once at this level , as the old soccer cliché goes , there are no easy games .
former bayern munich coach giovanni trapattoni will have to prepare the azzurri for games against scandinavian representatives sweden and denmark as well as the battling bulgarians .
the tournament will be staged in new or renovated stadiums in oporto , leiria , aveiro , coimbra , guimaraes , faro , braga and lisbon between june 12 and july 4 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

ursula andress was only 26 when she emerged from the sea as honey rider , in the james bond film doctor no .
the iconic image beat off competition from a lesbian kiss between sarah michelle gellar and selma blair in the film cruel intentions .
the top rated male actor was george clooney , who was nominated with jennifer lopez for out of sight .
' screen siren ' the character of honey rider was remembered for the sight of ms andress emerging from the water in a bikini , holding seashells and with a knife at her waist .
top 10 sexy scenes dr no - ursula andress emerges from the sea cruel intentions - sarah michelle gellar kisses selma blair from dusk til dawn - salma hayek performs erotic dance with a snake out of sight - george clooney and jennifer lopez locked in a car boot basic instinct - sharon stone uncrosses her legs while being interrogated while not wearing underwear 9 ½ weeks - the blindfolded food scenes with kim basinger and mickey rourke queer as folk - gay sex scenes who framed roger rabbit - jessica rabbit emmanuelle - various scenes including a romp on a plane american pie - jason watches exchange student nadia get undressed .
source : channel 4 a channel 4 spokeswoman said : " it 's nice to see an iconic figure can stand the test of time and still be the sexiest screen siren against much younger competition . "
the film critic bob mccabe said he was surprised but pleased by the outcome .
he said people had not gone for sex scenes and added " it just shows you that sexuality is about temptation " .
anyone looking for clues about how the list was drawn-up will quickly realise that it is dominated by women with few clothes on .
but some less obvious choices also did very well .
gay sex scenes from the programme queer as folk made number seven on the list .
salma hayek 's character performed erotic dance with snake and cartoon temptress jessica rabbit , from the film who framed roger rabbit , came in at number eight .
" people are responding the idea of how sex is presented in cinema rather than the reality of it .
" i mean , they 're not just going for the obvious people having a ' romantic relationship ' scenes . "

the bjp is trying to unseat the congress party in rajasthan , madhya pradesh , chattisgarh and the national capital , delhi - results are due on thursday .
congress , led by sonia gandhi , is the country 's main opposition having ruled india for five decades .
it is aiming to hold the states to boost its challenge against the bjp in national elections next year .
for prime minister atal behari vajpayee , the polls represent an opportunity to test the waters ahead of those polls .
although local issues are the focus in the states , a strong showing for the bjp could prompt him to call a general election a few months ahead of schedule , analysts say .
congress , for its part , believes a good result will indicate that it has governed the states well , thus persuading voters to give it a fresh chance at federal level .
hindi heartland the four states voting on monday all form part of the politically influential hindi-speaking belt in north and central india , often described as the hindi heartland .
vajpayee : must decide date of next year 's general election together with the states of uttar pradesh and bihar they send more mps to parliament than the rest of india put together .
a good showing here can propel a party to power and most indian prime ministers have been elected from this region .
this also means that regional leaders who are powerful have a chance to extend their career to the national stage .
all four states are witnessing a straight fight between the congress and the bjp , with the influence of smaller parties marginal at best .
this is a shift from the otherwise multi-party character of recent indian elections , with the present national government being made up of a coalition of more than 20 parties .
key players several charismatic and young leaders are leading the two parties in these polls and a strong showing will help increase their political stature and influence .
in madhya pradesh , chief minister digvijay singh is hoping to be returned to office for a third straight term .
the media-savvy mr singh , who is from an aristocratic background , is perceived to be reformist and many believe has a future in national politics .
but he faces a stiff challenge from the bjp 's uma bharati , a hindu nun who is a charismatic leader of the hindu right .
in the desert state of rajasthan , the congress 's ashok gehlot is being opposed by vasundhara raje of the bjp .
ms raje belongs to one of the country 's most noted royal families , the scindias , with ties to the nepalese royal family .
in the national capital , delhi , chief minister sheila dixit is hoping to be returned to power on the back of the city 's improved transport system and pollution levels .
while both ms dixit and her bjp opponent , madan lal khurana , are taking credit for improving the capital , they blame each other for delhi 's worsening security situation , particularly after an increase in crimes against women .
national scene a strong showing by the congress will strengthen ms gandhi while placing the party in pole position ahead of the general elections .
the bjp , on the other hand , may well decide to bring those polls forward to cash in on its appeal if it does well .
but smaller regional parties have a big influence in national elections and if the congress does badly , it may be forced to rethink its position of not forging alliances in the battle for delhi .

it is aiming to hold the states to boost its challenge against the bjp in national elections next year .
for prime minister atal behari vajpayee , the polls represent an opportunity to test the waters ahead of those polls .

about 120 ex-crew members and dockyard workers with links to the leander-class frigate hms scylla visited the vessel at plymouth 's devonport dockyard on saturday .
the 2,500-tonne vessel has been bought by plymouth 's national marine aquarium -lrb- nma -rrb- for about £ 200,000 with funding from the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- to be sunk off cornwall and colonised by sea life .
the ship , the last of her kind to be built at devonport dockyard in plymouth in the late 1960s , arrived back in the city earlier this month from portsmouth after months of negotiations .
hms scylla a leander class frigate with a general and anti-submarine role built in the late 1960s weighs 2,500-tonnes 113 metres in length the ship was recommended for disposal in 1991 she was decommissioned in december 1993 similar vessels have been placed on the seabed in canada , australia and new zealand the vessel was taken out of active service in 1993 and has been used as a training facility in portsmouth since then .
she is now to undergo preparation work to make her safe for divers and the underwater environment before she is scuttled off whitsand bay in cornwall .
among the visitors to the scylla was her last commanding officer , captain mike booth , plus shipwrights , surveyors and artificers .
captain booth said : " i think this would be a very fitting end to her .
" it would take an awful lot of work to get her into any shape for tourists to come on board .
" but if they 're going to put her at the bottom of the sea she wo n't need another lick of paint and she can still be enjoyed . "
melanie cowie of the nma said the group toured the ship 's sleeping quarters , wardroom and operations room .
she said : " it was a very moving , touching day .
people were very excited about the scylla 's future and some have decided to take diving lessons so they will be able to see her next stage . "
after she is sunk , the scylla will sit on the seabed around one mile offshore , where she is expected to attract recreational divers from around the world .
she is due to be sunk in april 2004 , after which it is expected she will help generate £ 1m a year for the local economy .
former warships have already been sunk to create diving reefs off canada , australia and new zealand , but this will be the first of its kind in europe .
experts from canada are currently in plymouth to advise contractors on how to prepare the vessel for sinking .

she is now to undergo preparation work to make her safe for divers and the underwater environment before she is scuttled off whitsand bay in cornwall .
among the visitors to the scylla was her last commanding officer , captain mike booth , plus shipwrights , surveyors and artificers .
captain booth said : " i think this would be a very fitting end to her .
" it would take an awful lot of work to get her into any shape for tourists to come on board .
" but if they 're going to put her at the bottom of the sea she wo n't need another lick of paint and she can still be enjoyed . "
melanie cowie of the nma said the group toured the ship 's sleeping quarters , wardroom and operations room .
hms scylla is due to be scuttled off cornwall in april 2004 she said : " it was a very moving , touching day .
people were very excited about the scylla 's future and some have decided to take diving lessons so they will be able to see her next stage . "
after she is sunk , the scylla will sit on the seabed around one mile offshore , where she is expected to attract recreational divers from around the world .
she is due to be sunk in april 2004 , after which it is expected she will help generate £ 1m a year for the local economy .

highlights included the opening performance by beyonce , eurythmics ' sweet dreams and u2 's frontman bono and guitarist the edge playing their song one - in the memory of an aids victim and friend .
queen played a medley of songs such as we will rock you , we are the champions and the show must go on .
outside the stadium , before the show , a young man was wielding a south african flag .
he was sporting a t-shirt that said " aids positive " .
" it is all about removing the stigma of aids , " he said .
" we have to learn to understand the disease and those who suffer from it .

there were strollers , toddlers , old people , young people .
some had 46664 tattoos , others showed support with red ribbon pins .
in the crowd , seated inside the stadium , was a family of seven .
the italian-born husband and wife lived in cape town but their daughter , grandchildren , his mother-in-law and sister-in-law had all joined them to spend christmas in south africa .
while in the country , they decided to give their support to the fight against aids by attending the concert .
wherever there is hope , there is a solution yusuf islam " we wanted to be here all the family because we must support this beautiful cause that these musicians are in here for , " he said .
" my family came all the way from italy to be with us , so here we are tonight . "
later , the singer miss dynamite said from the stage : " i have a message to all my ladies out there !
there is nothing sexier in the world than being confident with yourself .
respect yourself , and protect yourself .
" scream all of you ladies !
who out there is not afraid of asking their boyfriend to use a condom ?

she later proceeded to throw out condoms , reaching those standing in the front of the golden circle of greenpoint stadium .
standing ovation bob geldof , giving a speech spiked with humour as he stood with his accoustic guitar on one of the podiums reaching out from the stage , said : " we are here to reinforce today that aids is political .

one of the most powerful moments was when bono and an african choir led on a long walk to freedom , an original song written for the 46664 campaign , singing the refrain until nelson mandela walked in on stage .
the audience , giving their hero a standing ovation , clapped for so long that he was almost moved to tears on stage .

beyonce played her part in putting over the message it was a creative musical forum at which artists from all over came together for one cause : to increase hiv / aids awareness .
highlights included the opening performance by beyonce , eurythmics ' sweet dreams and u2 's frontman bono and guitarist the edge playing their song one - in the memory of an aids victim and friend .
queen played a medley of songs such as we will rock you , we are the champions and the show must go on .
outside the stadium , before the show , a young man was wielding a south african flag .
he was sporting a t-shirt that said " aids positive " .
" it is all about removing the stigma of aids , " he said .
" we have to learn to understand the disease and those who suffer from it .
i am here tonight to give my support for this world problem . "
diversity the crowd was mixed in age , race and sex .
there were strollers , toddlers , old people , young people .
some had 46664 tattoos , others showed support with red ribbon pins .
in the crowd , seated inside the stadium , was a family of seven .
the italian-born husband and wife lived in cape town but their daughter , grandchildren , his mother-in-law and sister-in-law had all joined them to spend christmas in south africa .
while in the country , they decided to give their support to the fight against aids by attending the concert .

respect yourself , and protect yourself .
" scream all of you ladies !
who out there is not afraid of asking their boyfriend to use a condom ?

she later proceeded to throw out condoms , reaching those standing in the front of the golden circle of greenpoint stadium .
standing ovation bob geldof , giving a speech spiked with humour as he stood with his accoustic guitar on one of the podiums reaching out from the stage , said : " we are here to reinforce today that aids is political .

one of the most powerful moments was when bono and an african choir led on a long walk to freedom , an original song written for the 46664 campaign , singing the refrain until nelson mandela walked in on stage .
the audience , giving their hero a standing ovation , clapped for so long that he was almost moved to tears on stage .
