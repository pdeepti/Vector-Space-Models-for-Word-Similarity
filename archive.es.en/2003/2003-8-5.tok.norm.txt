a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .
you can carry your furniture up from the cellar to the roof in 24 hours , but you ca n't do the same with fixed objects , he pointed out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .

once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .
" we will make clear that politicians " have a responsibility . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .

once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .

and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.08.2003 fashionistas unite in düsseldorf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the know head to düsseldorf for fashion .
its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .

fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .
finland , great britain , the netherlands , sweden and spain have also made inroads in the transition to digital tv , as have singapore and australia outside of europe .
france , italy and switzerland are currently planning their own dvb-t programs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .
finland , great britain , the netherlands , sweden and spain have also made inroads in the transition to digital tv , as have singapore and australia outside of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.08.2003 fashionistas unite in düsseldorf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the know head to düsseldorf for fashion .
its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .
finland , great britain , the netherlands , sweden and spain have also made inroads in the transition to digital tv , as have singapore and australia outside of europe .
france , italy and switzerland are currently planning their own dvb-t programs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .
finland , great britain , the netherlands , sweden and spain have also made inroads in the transition to digital tv , as have singapore and australia outside of europe .
france , italy and switzerland are currently planning their own dvb-t programs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .
you can carry your furniture up from the cellar to the roof in 24 hours , but you ca n't do the same with fixed objects , he pointed out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .
you can carry your furniture up from the cellar to the roof in 24 hours , but you ca n't do the same with fixed objects , he pointed out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.08.2003 fashionistas unite in düsseldorf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the know head to düsseldorf for fashion .
its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .
" we will make clear that politicians " have a responsibility . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .

the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2003 berlin ’ s tv goes digital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , no antenna !
the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .

it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2003 berlin ’ s tv goes digital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , no antenna !
the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .
finland , great britain , the netherlands , sweden and spain have also made inroads in the transition to digital tv , as have singapore and australia outside of europe .
france , italy and switzerland are currently planning their own dvb-t programs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .

the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .
" we ca n't punish " those who are carrying the burden , meyer said .
no investment , more on the dole after years of expansion and building in german cities , the country 's communities find themselves in a downward spiral .
less investment is coming in , meaning lower economic output .
fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole .
in the past ten years alone , investment has dropped by € 11 billion , according to the german association of cities and communities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- .
the most glaring example is the capital .
thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank , berlin is in debt to the tune of € 40 billion .
streets have become endless construction sites , where the money to complete the work has run out .
swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer , and fountains are drying up .
" if these developments continue like this and are n't stopped , then we 'll have to cut a major part of these services , " said gerd landsberg , of the dstgb in a radio interview .

the federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped german cities like berlin and frankfurt by introducing more taxes .
everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis . frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004 .
one of berlin 's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block .
the financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across germany , where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money .
now chancellor gerhard schröder wants to do something about it .
following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in hanover monday , word leaked out that schröder planned to relieve the financial burden of germany 's cities to the tune of more than € 4.5 billion -lrb- $ 5.1 billion -rrb- .
more taxes for business , self-employed though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced , news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion , some € 854 million in 2004 according to one report , of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities .
the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .
the general secretary of the conservative christian democratic union told german television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .
you can carry your furniture up from the cellar to the roof in 24 hours , but you ca n't do the same with fixed objects , he pointed out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed .
that , together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment , should significantly ease the burden , government members told reporters monday evening .
opposition politicians , who did not take part in the meeting with members of schröder 's coalition government , greeted the plan with suspicion .

the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the days of adjusting the antenna on the tv set to get a clearer picture are over - in berlin at least .
the capital and surrounding state of brandenburg have switched over exclusively to digital tv . monday morning at 7:59 , berlin said good-bye to analog television broadcasting .
it wasn ’ t a bittersweet , prolonged parting .
in fact , most people didn ’ t notice a thing .
but starting at 8:00 a.m. , broadcast television in berlin and brandenburg became a purely digital matter , with a sharper , more stable picture and a channel choice that jumped from 12 to 21 . the berlin-brandenburg region is europe ’ s first television broadcasting area to go completely digital . since most televisions can not read digital signals on their own , households without cable or satellite reception had to purchase so-called “ set-top boxes ” to take advantage of the technology .
in fact , the purchase of the boxes , which cost between € 88 and € 279 -lrb- $ 100 and $ 316 -rrb- wasn ’ t optional .
starting monday morning , viewers of analog sets who had put off buying the decoder found only blank screens . however , blank screens were in the minority , according to susanne grams , spokeswoman with the berlin-brandenburg media authority .
of the 170,000 households who depended on analog broadcasting for their television reception , some 150,000 had bought the set-top decoders before monday 's changeover . the future of tv the advantages of digital television , or dvb-t -lrb- digital video broadcasting – terrestrial -rrb- are many , according to proponents .
having to deal with blurry pictures , “ snow , ” or “ ghost ” images on the screen while watching your favorite sitcom will be a thing of the past . “ for relatively low investment , you can get digital quality television in your home , ” wilfried runde , dw-world 's expert for multimedia , explained .
once the decoder has been purchased , unlike cable , there are no monthly costs .
a small antenna about the size of a pencil gives viewers access to 21 television channels and 11 radio stations with significantly improved sound and picture quality . dvb-t also breaks the analog chains that have limited the reach of television until now .
digital tv backers say its primary advantage is its ability to be received theoretically anywhere , in the car or even on handheld devices such as palm pilots .
with the widespread adoption of digital television technology , analysts say it is only a matter of time before television pictures start popping up on pcs , mobile phones or even wristwatches . “ we will start seeing the possibility of personalized tv offered on mobile devices , ” said runde , who is working on ways for dw-world to integrate television into websites .
“ we will see the advent of new hybrid models that will connect television with other information sources . ” coming to a tv near you berlin won ’ t be the only digital tv area in germany for long .
next year the federal states of saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and north rhine-westphalia will be following in berlin ’ s footsteps and doing away with analog broadcasting .
the old technology ’ s days in germany are numbered .
the country ’ s parliament decided that analog broadcasting should be completely replaced by its digital successor by no later than 2010 . germany is a european leader in digital broadcasting , but not the only player on the block .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.08.2003 fashionistas unite in düsseldorf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the know head to düsseldorf for fashion .
its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .
the bread & butter trade fair , showing " urbanwear and street couture " , used to be in cologne but moved to berlin this year .
and the " no dress ? ! " public show in berlin is a hot venue for small , innovative labels promoting young talent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .

a year later , rebuilding has been largely completed , but many people are behaving as if it could never happen again . last august , germany was taken - literally - by storm .
the " flood of the century " washed away almost everything in its path and wreaked more than € 9 billion -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- of damage across large areas of the country . when the rain stopped and the water levels of germany 's rivers slowly began to sink , people in saxony , saxon-anhalt , brandenburg and bavaria started taking stock of the damage , while the rest of germany began demonstrating their generosity .
they transferred millions into the coffers of aid organizations for flood victims .
the german protestant church alone recorded the highest ever amount of donations to its emergency aid section : around € 64 million , two-thirds of which went toward flood victims . the government and the states hurriedly passed an emergency package of € 4.4 billion in subsidies for the victims .
the lion 's share , 78 percent , went to saxony , which was hit worst . not as bad as expected a year on , rebuilding continues , and it really was n't as bad as had been predicted in the direct wake of the floods .
at the time , economists estimated the floods had caused € 20 billion in damages . around 12,000 companies were affected in saxony , threatening 100,000 jobs , according to saxon state secretary for economy andrea fischer in a statement last week .
but the companies did n't all go broke , and the jobs were n't all lost .
" we do n't know of any business that declared insolvency only because of the flood catastrophe , " fischer said . the subsidies too , seem to be covering the costs .
" we are assuming the money will suffice , " state spokesman hartmut häckel said on thursday . in dresden , which suffered to the tune of € 600 million in damages , most of the harm that was done to the semper opera and the zwinger palace has been redressed .
but little has been done to ensure that the next serious flood wo n't threaten the buildings and the treasures they house once more .
only constructing a protective wall around them would ensure their safety . the authorities are concerned that too many people did not learn the right lessons from the disaster .
many have rebuilt their houses on sites which are likely be ravaged again when the next " flood of the century " breaks the dams , according to the saxon interior ministry . environment minister steffen flath said he could n't understand people who have installed their furnaces or power sources in the cellar once more , when cellars were filled with meters of water last year .
such people could n't expect the " same solidarity like now " if it happens again , he said .
" all of our concepts for protection aim for one or maybe two floods each century , " flath said .
more extensive programs were not financially feasible , he contended . " that 's why everyone is advised to take precautions , " flath said .

its organizers say it ’ s the world 's largest fashion trade fair .
so what is cpd man-woman doing in germany ? when most people think fashion , paris immediately comes to mind .
this though is followed quickly , of course , by milan , new york or london . but for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week , the most important place to be was in düsseldorf , germany .
the three-day fashion trade fair " collections premieres düsseldorf-cpd woman-man " comes to a close on tuesday .
in it , some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women 's and men 's collections for spring and summer 2004 .
and the show 's organizers , igedo , said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000 . low fashion profile despite its no-frills image , germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers , such as karl lagerfeld , jil sander , wolfgang joop and hugo boss . and firms like escada , bogner , and strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades .
but while fashion plays an important role in daily life in germany , especially for young people , the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as france and italy . in germany , high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset , like art , literature or architecture . thus , some of the hottest young german designers , such as dirk schönberger , markus lupfer , and bernhard willhelm , choose to work abroad .
" germany is not a classic fashion country , " says peter paul polte , editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine textilwirtschaft -lrb- textile industry . -rrb-
" but german companies know a lot about marketing and production . " fashion exports according to cpd statistics , germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in europe .
in 2000 , germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the united states and hong kong .
in 2001 , german textile and apparel imports amounted to almost € 30 billion -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- . as an exporter , germany ranks fifth , after china , hong kong , italy and the united states , with total exports of € 19.5 billion in 2001 . yet as with so much else having to do with germany 's economy , the picture is not entirely rosy .
in 2002 , the german textile and clothing industry had turnover of some € 23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for € 9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year .
this year , with the economy faltering , fashion is once again on the ropes , with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year , from the same period last year , according to the associated press .
düsseldorf , with its fashion trade fairs -lrb- in addition to cpd , there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair , -rrb- supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about € 13 billion .
the königsallee , or kö , is one of the great shopping streets of europe , lined with upscale designer boutiques .
fashion capital moves to berlin ?
while industry insiders hope the fair will give german fashion sales a boost , düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city .
since the wall came down in 1989 , berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country 's culture capital , with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities .
recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so , but harald schartau , the economy minister of the state of north rhine westphalia -lrb- of which düsseldorf is the capital -rrb- denies it .
düsseldorf will remain germany 's fashion capital , schartau told the dpa news agency .
" the -lrb- cpd -rrb- benefits from a unique environment , from the many -lrb- locally -rrb- -based textile and clothing companies , designer-oriented shops and retailers , fashion centers , showrooms and order rooms , and a network of creative workers in advertising , design and fashion , " he said .
yet even if cpd stays in düsseldorf , german fashion 's cutting edge may already belong to berlin .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- reuters to shift core unit to india bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 5 august , 2003 , 04:21 gmt 05:21 uk reuters to shift core unit to india news and financial information provider reuters is planning to move much of the core of its operation to india in an attempt to save money .
the move , unveiled on 28 july in a simultaneous presentation to 1,100 staff worldwide will see new products being developed at either hyderabad or bangalore .
but as made clear in documents seen by bbc news online and distributed at the worldwide presentation to the content division - the section which generates the financial data reuters sells to banks and other key customers - the move will almost certainly involve redundancies .
among staff affected are 350 based in tiverton in south-west england , another 65 in edinburgh in scotland , as well as a further 600 or so in new york and white plains in the us , singapore in east asia , and in several other offices around the world .
the content operation supplies the data which appears on reuters screens used by investors .
the company makes most of its money from the screens , rather than from selling news to papers and broadcasters , so the content division is at the core of the company .
many companies are shifting call centres and other ancillary divisions to india to save money , but a shift of core operations is more rare .
competition reuters sources told bbc news online that the announcement was already hitting morale , and that some staff are already planning to jump before they are pushed .
the documents generated for the 28 july meeting suggest the company is making contingency plans for large-scale redundancies in the wake of the announcement .
in them , the company insists it has no choice but to save money with the switch to india , in order to remain competitive .
the content division was recently swelled by the acquisition of data company multex .
staff who had joined reuters from multex were told at the fast forward day that their jobs were safe .
but bbc news online has heard that within days , senior managers in the content division were being told that this was not the case .
turnaround reuters is in the middle of a 3,000-staff redundancy and cost-cutting programme dubbed fast forward , outlined at a company-wide day of meetings on 11 july .
a reuters spokeswoman said that no decision had been made yet on what , if any , functions would move to india to supplement the new products to be developed there , but that an announcement would be made by mid-september .
any job losses , she said , would be included in the 3,000 already planned into fast forward .
the fast forward programme is an attempt to keep up with the burgeoning sales of competitors bloomberg and thomson financial - both of whom claim their data is more accessible to users .
reuters pulled itself back to profit in the first six months of 2003 .
but it warned that sales of subscriptions for data were down 10 % on the previous year - and that another two years of tough times still lay ahead .

long-term stress is worse for the heart than putting on 40lbs or ageing 30 years because workers deal with stress by smoking , drinking and " slobbing out " .

the recommendations cover the method and frequency of cleaning , internal monitoring of standards and the training of relevant staff .
they will act as an interim guide until further recommendations are available from the scottish executive task force on hospital acquired infections -lrb- hais -rrb- .
the new standards were unveiled on tuesday by the health minister malcolm chisholm at the royal hospital for sick children in edinburgh .
standards of cleanliness in scotland 's hospitals were put in the spotlight by two official reports earlier this year .
in january , a report by the health watchdog nhs quality improvement scotland said too many nhs trusts had inadequate procedures in place to tackle hospital infections .
training and development another report , from the financial watchdog audit scotland , called for improvement after it conducted spot checks on 74 hospitals and found only half had high levels of cleanliness on wards .
tuesday 's announcement will see clear interim guidelines issued to healthcare professionals in an attempt to improve cleanliness .
the key elements include : specifications on the level and type of cleaning in different hospital areas guidance on internal monitoring , and auditing of cleaning services recommendations on the training and development of staff with cleaning responsibilities .
mr chisholm said : " clean hospitals and the highest standards of infection control are an absolute priority for nhs scotland .
" cleaning service staff are an essential part of the multi-disciplinary approach to increased public , patient and staff safety .
" as part of the multi-disciplinary team , cleaning service staff should rightly expect to be managed , supervised and trained which is why i believe it is essential that staff training and development is emphasised in the cleaning specifications . "
' matrons ' call the tories called for the return of matrons to oversee cleanliness standards on hospital wards .
the party 's health spokesman david davidson said : " our hospital wards need someone with experience , authority and the respect of the patients and staff to rigorously apply hygiene standards .
" this ' special sister ' or ' modern matron ' could assist in improving hygiene standards , and would also afford patients a recognisable person to whom they can go with problems and concerns .
" by sitting on its hands for too long , the executive allowed a long-recognised problem to deteriorate . "

last month , federal prosecutors subpoenad documents from worldcom after at & t claimed it was defrauding competitors by improperly routing domestic telephone calls to avoid paying fees to other us telecoms firms .
but worldcom has told a us bankruptcy court that the accusations are part of an escalating campaign to damage its chances of emerging from bankruptcy .
" at & t 's filing makes sensational accusations wholly unsupported by evidence or law , " worldcom said in a statement .
worldcom is trying to shrug off an $ 11bn accounting fraud by rebranded itself as mci , one of the many companies it acquired during its 1980s and 1990s expansionist drive .
but the accusations from at & t have provoked a new probe into fraudulent activity just as mci is trying to draw a line under the last one .
' malicious ' at & t accused mci of " playing fast and loose with our national interests " by disguising codes on long-distance calls to route them through canada .
" at & t 's invocation of the national interest is a transparent attempt to promote its corporate self-interest in shutting down one of its competitors by publishing malicious fabrications , " mci retorted .
" what is striking about those allegations is that ... at & t has described a process for least-cost routing that is entirely legal , " mci said in its 15-page filing .
long-distance companies have to pay a few cents a minute to other phone firms for " terminating " calls - delivering them to the person on the far end of the line .
but mci is accused of reaching deals with small local carriers to disguise its own traffic as local calls , thus avoiding paying the termination fees .
at & t denied that the claims were designed to increase the telecom firm 's competitive advantage .
" an act of fraud has been committed upon the shareholders of at & t through an elaborate scheme to dump high-cost traffic which originated on mci 's network onto at & t 's network , " at & t spokesman jim byrnes said .

ryanair , europe 's largest low-cost airline , has reported a 12 % rise in profit over the past three months .
the irish firm made 43.8m euros -lrb- £ 31m -rrb- during april , may and june , in line with expectations .
" during what ba last week described as the most testing period in aviation history , we continue to ... deliver increased profits , " said chief executive michael o 'leary .
ryanair 's european focus has sheltered it from the global slump in aviation caused by the spread of the deadly sars virus in asia .
while european passenger figures are on a par with last year , far fewer american and asians are taking to the skies , the latest figures from the air transport body reveal .
empty seats mr o 'leary told bbc radio that he had no desire to fly longhaul and that the best market was in europe .
despite the rise in profits , ryanair has seen an increase in the percentage of empty seats on its flights , a key indicator of profitability .
mr o 'leary attributed the decline in the so-called load factor to the launch of 50 new routes and insisted that things " had never been better " .
one cloud on the horizon , however , is that the european commission is currently investigating ryanair 's operation at brussels charleroi airport .

the plan has been hatched at loch duart , a salmon farming company based in remote scourie in sutherland .
the company said that despite its rubbery appearance , the aquatic plant is very similar in taste to the more expensive oyster .
seaweed has been an important part of the japanese diet for more than 2,000 years and was used as a herbal medicine by the greeks and romans .
according to the managing director of loch duart , nick joy , seaweed is packed with vitamins and minerals and could help replace nutrients which salmon farming takes out of deep sea lochs .
' early stage ' " it has a very sea-y taste , a bit like an oyster , " he said .
" it 's a very exciting idea because seaweed is very good for you , very nice to eat and can be eaten by vegetarians too . "
the company 's sustainably-farmed salmon is served in top london restaurants including nobu and the ivy .
it has also drawn acclaim from celebrity chefs including rick stein . "
it took a long time to learn how to farm salmon properly and sustainably and it 's going to take a long time for seaweed as well . "
nick joy loch duart mr joy said demand for seafood was high at the moment , largely because of the boom in popularity of sushi across europe .
his company is now aiming to expand seaweed production to around 200 tonnes annually within the next four years so that it can start exporting abroad .
but he warned that plans for mass producing seaweed on ropes were " very much at an early stage " because of the difficulty of cultivating it in bulk .
" we know it grows , the question is how to get the best quality and the right volume , " he said .
" i tasted some from our ropes last week and it was n't as good as the stuff in the spring .
" it took a long time to learn how to farm salmon properly and sustainably and it 's going to take a long time for seaweed as well . "
