boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2003 polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw actively backed the u.s.-led war in iraq as polish troops are seen here guarding the port of umm qasr .
berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .
to a great extent our common success will depend on that , " cimoszewicz said , after he discussed the proposal with u.s. secretary of state colin powell in washington .
others are willing the minister said he was not singling out germany as a partner and there were many other willing governments .
poland also made clear that it would need a u.n. mandate to take part in the peacekeeping mission .
struck is expected to discuss the proposal with his danish counterpart , svend aage jensby , in copenhagen today and take it up again at the trilateral baltic meeting may 8 of defense ministers from germany , denmark , poland and the baltic states tomorrow -lrb- thursday -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .

" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .

following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2003 polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw actively backed the u.s.-led war in iraq as polish troops are seen here guarding the port of umm qasr .
berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .
to a great extent our common success will depend on that , " cimoszewicz said , after he discussed the proposal with u.s. secretary of state colin powell in washington .
others are willing the minister said he was not singling out germany as a partner and there were many other willing governments .
poland also made clear that it would need a u.n. mandate to take part in the peacekeeping mission .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .
to a great extent our common success will depend on that , " cimoszewicz said , after he discussed the proposal with u.s. secretary of state colin powell in washington .
others are willing the minister said he was not singling out germany as a partner and there were many other willing governments .
poland also made clear that it would need a u.n. mandate to take part in the peacekeeping mission .
struck is expected to discuss the proposal with his danish counterpart , svend aage jensby , in copenhagen today and take it up again at the trilateral baltic meeting may 8 of defense ministers from germany , denmark , poland and the baltic states tomorrow -lrb- thursday -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .

" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2003 polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw actively backed the u.s.-led war in iraq as polish troops are seen here guarding the port of umm qasr .
berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq . " considering that we have n't even discussed it with a single word before , " german defense minister peter struck said the suggestion was " a complete surprise to the german government , " and showed irritation that his polish counterpart had floated the idea in the american press .
speaking to the washington times on tuesday , polish defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski had suggested that the joint polish-german-danish nato corps stationed in northwestern poland since 1999 could be used for a " stabilization force " in iraq .
denmark , which is sending soldiers and paramedics as part of a multinational stabilization force in iraq under british command , did not comment on the suggestion .
' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .
to a great extent our common success will depend on that , " cimoszewicz said , after he discussed the proposal with u.s. secretary of state colin powell in washington .
others are willing the minister said he was not singling out germany as a partner and there were many other willing governments .
poland also made clear that it would need a u.n. mandate to take part in the peacekeeping mission .
struck is expected to discuss the proposal with his danish counterpart , svend aage jensby , in copenhagen today and take it up again at the trilateral baltic meeting may 8 of defense ministers from germany , denmark , poland and the baltic states tomorrow -lrb- thursday -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

' structure in place ' " a commando structure is already in place " for the peacekeeping operation in iraq , szmajdzinkski told the post .
" we would like to have german troops . "
the polish defense minister said he was convinced that washington would be interested in such a proposal , despite strained relations with berlin .
the joint polish-german-danish nato corps in szczecin , poland , has a current force of 130 soldiers with german and danish soldiers making up the lion ’ s share of the officers .
it is widely believed that the multinational corps is the only one in the country that is capable of tackling a daunting military operation such as commanding an occupied zone in iraq .
poland - a future eu member , which sent a small contingent of troops to fight in the u.s.-led war in iraq - has been assigned by the u.s. to control postwar iraq 's northern sector .
however , a government speaker said late tuesday that poland would need a u.n. security council mandate to take part in any u.s.-organized peacekeeping mission .
the u.s. plan foresees dividing iraq into three administrative sectors and inviting troops from various nations to form peacekeeping forces to secure its reconstruction .
germany , france and russia , strong opponents of the u.s.-led war in iraq , have pointedly been kept out of discussions in washington on the shape of the international stabilization force in iraq .
german dilemma for its part , berlin has ruled out the possibility of sending german soldiers to iraq as peacekeepers for the time being , at least until the occupying forces are sanctioned by the united nations . german government spokesman bela anda reasserted this week that the reconstruction of postwar iraq must take place under a u.n. mandate .
however , berlin has indicated that it does n't rule out a nato peacekeeping force for iraq , one which would not necessarily need u.n. authorization .
at the same time , chancellor schröder ’ s government has emphasized that a nato force would not automatically mean that germany would be part of the peacekeeping deployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck defense minister struck -lrb- photo -rrb- made clear that he foresees several hurdles when it comes to deploying german troops in iraq .
" i don ’ t want to conceal my skepticism with regard to the proposal , " struck said on tuesday .
it ’ s clear that such a deployment would need a parliamentary mandate , " said struck , and ruled out making a decision on the matter by july , as urged by warsaw .
following the sharp reactions , warsaw toned down its rhetoric . polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said late on tuesday that poland would like to have as many european partners aboard the peacekeeping mission as possible .
" we would like to have as many european partners as possible to work together with us .
to a great extent our common success will depend on that , " cimoszewicz said , after he discussed the proposal with u.s. secretary of state colin powell in washington .
others are willing the minister said he was not singling out germany as a partner and there were many other willing governments .
poland also made clear that it would need a u.n. mandate to take part in the peacekeeping mission .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .

boycott of europe loses steam iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy anti-american or anti-bush ? germany -pipe- 09.05.2003 schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and president george bush have had no personal contact since a nato summit in november .
german chancellor schröder continued his efforts to smooth over u.s.-german ties friday , stressing the “ vital friendship ” between the two countries one week before u.s. secretary of state powell visits berlin . speaking at celebrations in berlin marking the 100th anniversary of the american chamber of commerce in germany , schröder said germany would remain a steadfast ally of the united states despite occasional differences of opinion . “ along with all the fundamental things we have in common , there are naturally also differences that we should calmly call by name , if we want to deepen our relations even further , ” he said , alluding to the rift caused by the war in iraq . german-american relations have been strained for months by schröder ’ s unrelenting opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
u.s. president george w. bush was angered by what schröder has called " exaggerated remarks " made on iraq during the german election campaign last autumn . powell 's visit seen as key though the two leaders have had no personal contact for over half a year , berlin has been making conciliatory gestures towards washington since the end of the war . powell ’ s visit next friday is likely to be critical in helping restore high-level ties between the two countries . powell will also use his trip to try to persuade european countries in the united nations security council that opposed the war in iraq - namely germany , france and russia - to support washington in its efforts to repeal economic sanctions against baghdad now that the regime of saddam hussein has been toppled . making clear he hoped to put the tension with washington of the past few months behind him , schröder said in his speech that he wanted to look toward the future without forgetting how the united states had helped rebuild the german economy and democracy in the aftermath of world war ii .
but he also reiterated his view that germany needed to continue to be " reluctant to use military force " to solve conflicts . eu defense no threat to nato schröder also tried to assuage fears that a recent so-called “ mini-summit ” on european defense issues could have a detrimental effect on nato .
he said germany , france , belgium and luxembourg had not proposed strengthening the european union ’ s defensive capabilities in order to decouple europe from the united states , but rather to make the eu a more effective partner in the transatlantic alliance . “ progress in european security and defense policies are in my view completely in the interest of the transatlantic partnership , ” schröder said . but schröder warned no one should try to make germany pick sides between the united states and france , saying both friendships were important to berlin .
whereas france has said it was opposed to a unipolar world led by the united states , schröder said “ freedom , peace and justice ” should be the only criteria upon which countries should orient themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel coats speaking just before schröder , u.s. ambassador dan coats said american-german ties went deeper than mere trade and business relations .
though he did not specifically mention the rift caused by iraq , he stressed that the two countries needed to work together to meet the challenges of the 21st century . “ we have had to face challenges before and we will do so again , ” said coats . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relationship on its way back to normal germany 's defense minister had a " friendly meeting " with his u.s. counterpart , donald rumsfeld , on monday .

yao fuxin was sentenced to seven years , while xiao yunliang was ordered to serve four years , according to the new york-based china labor watch .
the two men were found guilty of subversion .
mr yao and mr xiao led mass demonstrations in march and april , 2002 , in protest against unemployment and corruption .
in north-eastern liaoyang city , liaoning province , up to 30,000 people joined the peaceful protests .
the demonstrations were largely successful in helping remove corruption and getting labour issues addressed .
' hostile contacts ' the two men were arrested last year and tried in january , 2003 .
the court accused mr yao and mr xiao of having contact with " hostile elements and foreign media " , china labor watch said .
the group 's executive director li qiang said the sentences were excessive .
" it is not acceptable , " he said .
" this shows that the chinese government is suppressing chinese workers ' peaceful struggle . "
mr yao and mr xiao will appeal against their sentences , mr li said .
large-scale demonstrations are still unusual in china but correspondents say dissent is growing , as workers who used to be guaranteed wages , housing and health care are suddenly being left with little or nothing .

members of the scottish youth parliament attended with more than 200 other delegates from health organisations and the public and voluntary sectors .
the conference , which was being organised by the scottish tobacco control alliance -lrb- stca -rrb- , aimed to formulate new " ways to defuse the health time bomb of young people smoking " .
it is estimated that around 30,000 people in scotland die each year through tobacco-related conditions .
speakers debated a range of topics - from successful initiatives helping young people to quit smoking , to the policies that politicians can implement to discourage tobacco use .
brian pringle , chair of stca , said : " tobacco is still the single most significant threat to scottish young people 's long term health , and this is a vital opportunity to make sure that this threat is addressed .
' unethical behaviour ' " my experience as a youth education worker shows me how important it is to consider both fags and hash .
" it 's clear that many young people are using cannabis and tobacco together - in fact , nearly a third of scottish teenagers have smoked cannabis in the last year - so we need to make sure that we take that into account when giving information on quitting .
" we must also have up-to-date and relevant information about both substances . "
exposing the tobacco industry 's unethical behaviour has had a huge impact in other countries professor gerard hastings the conference was chaired by professor gerard hastings , of strathclyde university 's centre for tobacco control research .
he said : " our young people remain the primary target for the tobacco companies who are prepared to spend millions to protect their profits .
" they need to recruit 26,000 new smokers each year in scotland alone to replace those who die or quit .
" the recent ban on tobacco advertising was a great start , but there 's still lots more we can and should do .
" smoke-free workplaces , and restricting smoking in public places have been proved to reduce young people 's smoking rates , while exposing the tobacco industry 's unethical behaviour has had a huge impact in other countries . "

the group promoting the new flag has now contacted the flag institute , which is one of the world 's main research and documentation centres for flags .
bumper stickers commercial flag makers are already offering the devon flag at prices ranging from £ 7 for a small flag to £ 95 for a full size version .

the company will change its tariffs to include a £ 4-a-month charge for unlimited sending of picture messages , and put training staff in its 248 uk stores .
like many mobile phone firms , orange has spent the past two years concentrating on getting more money out of its customers , instead of on simply adding new users to its roster , which barely grew in the first three months of this year .
mobile data services are seen as the way to do that , and the company said it wants to double the number of customers using data to two million of its 13.5 million-strong user base .
10 % of the use orange 's finances are in a relatively healthy state , since much of its debt is held by parent france telecom .
sales were up 10 % in the first three months of the year over the same period of 2002 .
data revenue makes up 12 % of that , and orange wants to lift that to 25 % by 2005 - although mobile phone operators were saying much the same about the year 2001 during the tech boom of the 1990s .
four out of five orange customers , the company noted in a statement , use only 10 % of their phones ' capabilities .
" our customers are n't getting the most out of their phones , " said david taylor , vice-president of customer marketing for orange .
" mobile services are n't useful unless people know how to use them . "

those living near lancashire county cricket ground , where springsteen will play on 29 may , said locals would be forced to listen " to a rock concert in bed " .
but a court overturned a council decision to ban the show , saying promoters had promised to rectify past problems .
the cricket club said on friday the cancellation of the concert could have put the future of its home under threat .
more than 50,000 tickets for the show have been sold .
trafford borough council had refused to grant the event a licence after noise and crowd concerns from residents .
we wo n't go away - it 's totally selfish and just about money lynne jenkinson local resident people living nearby said there had been parking , noise and anti-social behaviour problems at oasis and robbie williams shows .
but trafford magistrates court overruled the council on thursday , saying it had to " strike a balance between the rights of the residents and lancashire county cricket ground " .
" we are extremely aware of the predicament of the local residents with regard to the disturbance caused by concerts of this type , sporting events and the growth of other activities in the locality , " said timothy jenkinson , chairman of the board .
" however , we have given a great deal of consideration to the profile of this particular artist and the maturity of the support which he attracts . "
but one local , lynne jenkinson , of greatstone road , said : " we wo n't go away .
it 's disgraceful .
it 's totally selfish and just about money . "
the club says the concert has secured its future at old trafford promoters sjm concerts and rock steady security were behind the court challenge .
the court 's decision could have a bearing on the council 's decision on whether to let the move rock festival go ahead at the venue in july .
the council refused to consider the licence application for the festival , which will feature rem and the manic street preachers , until after the springsteen ruling .
jim cumbes , chief executive of lancashire county cricket club , said the decision was critical for securing the future of the 146-year-old ground .
he added : " had the decision gone against us then that would have been the end of pop concerts at old trafford .
" if that was the case we 've got to look at where our other income sources come from and where our costs are .
" clearly one of them is an old stadium so it follows that you ask , does lancashire county cricket club actually move from old trafford and build a new stadium from scratch , where maintenance costs are going to be lower ? "
