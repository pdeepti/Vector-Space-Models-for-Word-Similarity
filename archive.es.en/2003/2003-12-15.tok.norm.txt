program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .

with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .

by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 saddam 's uncertain future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will the ex-dictator stand trial ?
great britain is in favor of trying saddam hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and iraqi leaders say such a trial will have an “ international dimension . "
but the u.s. has stayed quiet on the captive 's future . two days after his capture saturday night , the location where u.s. forces are holding and questioning saddam hussein remained a mystery . uncertain as well was the future of the deposed dictator , found by u.s. special forces hiding in a eight-foot hole in the backyard of a farmhouse near hussein 's hometown of tikrit .
u.s. president george w. bush , in a three-minute speech on sunday , said the former iraqi leader would be given the “ justice he denied to millions . ” on monday , bush told canadian prime minister paul martin during a phone conversation that he wanted the iraqi people involved in trying saddam hussein and that the tribunal must also be credible , reuters news service reported . whether that meant hussein ’ s handover to the newly-established iraqi war crimes tribunal or a trial elsewhere remained unclear .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said hussein , for the time being , would be treated as a prisoner of war . rumsfeld said the 66-year-old has so far been “ uncooperative ” in talks with u.s. intelligence officials .
members of the iraqi governing council had the same to say after a 30-minute meeting with hussein monday . “ he was defiant .
he tried to justify his crimes by saying he was a just ruler , " adnan pachachi , iraq 's foreign minister before hussein took power , told the washington post . iraqi trial with “ international dimension ” council members already said they are ready to try hussein at the country ’ s first tribunal .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .

great britain is in favor of trying saddam hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and iraqi leaders say such a trial will have an “ international dimension . "
but the u.s. has stayed quiet on the captive 's future . two days after his capture saturday night , the location where u.s. forces are holding and questioning saddam hussein remained a mystery . uncertain as well was the future of the deposed dictator , found by u.s. special forces hiding in a eight-foot hole in the backyard of a farmhouse near hussein 's hometown of tikrit .
u.s. president george w. bush , in a three-minute speech on sunday , said the former iraqi leader would be given the “ justice he denied to millions . ” on monday , bush told canadian prime minister paul martin during a phone conversation that he wanted the iraqi people involved in trying saddam hussein and that the tribunal must also be credible , reuters news service reported . whether that meant hussein ’ s handover to the newly-established iraqi war crimes tribunal or a trial elsewhere remained unclear .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said hussein , for the time being , would be treated as a prisoner of war . rumsfeld said the 66-year-old has so far been “ uncooperative ” in talks with u.s. intelligence officials .
members of the iraqi governing council had the same to say after a 30-minute meeting with hussein monday . “ he was defiant .
he tried to justify his crimes by saying he was a just ruler , " adnan pachachi , iraq 's foreign minister before hussein took power , told the washington post . iraqi trial with “ international dimension ” council members already said they are ready to try hussein at the country ’ s first tribunal .

more than 300,000 iranians died in the war from 1980-1988 , including thousands in poison gas attacks waged by iraqi troops . “ i hope we can defend iranians ' rightful demands at a proper place , ” a government spokesman told a news conference . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. forces capture saddam hussein u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

members of the iraqi governing council had the same to say after a 30-minute meeting with hussein monday . “ he was defiant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

u.s. president george w. bush , in a three-minute speech on sunday , said the former iraqi leader would be given the “ justice he denied to millions . ” on monday , bush told canadian prime minister paul martin during a phone conversation that he wanted the iraqi people involved in trying saddam hussein and that the tribunal must also be credible , reuters news service reported . whether that meant hussein ’ s handover to the newly-established iraqi war crimes tribunal or a trial elsewhere remained unclear .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .

"
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .

however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

great britain is in favor of trying saddam hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and iraqi leaders say such a trial will have an “ international dimension . "
but the u.s. has stayed quiet on the captive 's future . two days after his capture saturday night , the location where u.s. forces are holding and questioning saddam hussein remained a mystery . uncertain as well was the future of the deposed dictator , found by u.s. special forces hiding in a eight-foot hole in the backyard of a farmhouse near hussein 's hometown of tikrit .
u.s. president george w. bush , in a three-minute speech on sunday , said the former iraqi leader would be given the “ justice he denied to millions . ” on monday , bush told canadian prime minister paul martin during a phone conversation that he wanted the iraqi people involved in trying saddam hussein and that the tribunal must also be credible , reuters news service reported . whether that meant hussein ’ s handover to the newly-established iraqi war crimes tribunal or a trial elsewhere remained unclear .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said hussein , for the time being , would be treated as a prisoner of war . rumsfeld said the 66-year-old has so far been “ uncooperative ” in talks with u.s. intelligence officials .
members of the iraqi governing council had the same to say after a 30-minute meeting with hussein monday . “ he was defiant .
he tried to justify his crimes by saying he was a just ruler , " adnan pachachi , iraq 's foreign minister before hussein took power , told the washington post . iraqi trial with “ international dimension ” council members already said they are ready to try hussein at the country ’ s first tribunal .
they added that the trial should have an “ international dimension , ” because of the nature of the crimes hussein has committed since assuming power in 1979 . " we believe he should be tried by an iraqi court , but many of his crimes have an international dimension - like war crimes , like crimes against humanity , " said interim iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari . great britain , america ’ s closest ally , came out in favor of putting hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and said it would refuse to play a part in any trial where hussein faced a death sentence . great britain : iraq should handle saddam ” domestic tribunals … should wherever possible try war criminals – and only where that is not available or not appropriate does one make use of international courts , ” british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference .
he added that iraqi had a “ few good judges ” and “ good legal traditions . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw came out in favor of trying saddam hussein in iraq . straw echoed the opinion of many european leaders , who followed their congratulations to bush with requests that hussein ’ s fate be decided by the iraqis themselves or another international court . iran , which waged a bloody eight-year war against hussein ’ s iraq in the 1980s , announced monday it was preparing to file a suit against hussein in the international criminal court in the hague .
more than 300,000 iranians died in the war from 1980-1988 , including thousands in poison gas attacks waged by iraqi troops . “ i hope we can defend iranians ' rightful demands at a proper place , ” a government spokesman told a news conference . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. forces capture saddam hussein u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .

great britain is in favor of trying saddam hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and iraqi leaders say such a trial will have an “ international dimension . "

"
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .

pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .

german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .

this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .

" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .

“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .

"
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

great britain is in favor of trying saddam hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and iraqi leaders say such a trial will have an “ international dimension . "
but the u.s. has stayed quiet on the captive 's future . two days after his capture saturday night , the location where u.s. forces are holding and questioning saddam hussein remained a mystery . uncertain as well was the future of the deposed dictator , found by u.s. special forces hiding in a eight-foot hole in the backyard of a farmhouse near hussein 's hometown of tikrit .
u.s. president george w. bush , in a three-minute speech on sunday , said the former iraqi leader would be given the “ justice he denied to millions . ” on monday , bush told canadian prime minister paul martin during a phone conversation that he wanted the iraqi people involved in trying saddam hussein and that the tribunal must also be credible , reuters news service reported . whether that meant hussein ’ s handover to the newly-established iraqi war crimes tribunal or a trial elsewhere remained unclear .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said hussein , for the time being , would be treated as a prisoner of war . rumsfeld said the 66-year-old has so far been “ uncooperative ” in talks with u.s. intelligence officials .
members of the iraqi governing council had the same to say after a 30-minute meeting with hussein monday . “ he was defiant .
he tried to justify his crimes by saying he was a just ruler , " adnan pachachi , iraq 's foreign minister before hussein took power , told the washington post . iraqi trial with “ international dimension ” council members already said they are ready to try hussein at the country ’ s first tribunal .
they added that the trial should have an “ international dimension , ” because of the nature of the crimes hussein has committed since assuming power in 1979 . " we believe he should be tried by an iraqi court , but many of his crimes have an international dimension - like war crimes , like crimes against humanity , " said interim iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari . great britain , america ’ s closest ally , came out in favor of putting hussein before the iraqi war crimes tribunal and said it would refuse to play a part in any trial where hussein faced a death sentence . great britain : iraq should handle saddam ” domestic tribunals … should wherever possible try war criminals – and only where that is not available or not appropriate does one make use of international courts , ” british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference .
he added that iraqi had a “ few good judges ” and “ good legal traditions . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw came out in favor of trying saddam hussein in iraq . straw echoed the opinion of many european leaders , who followed their congratulations to bush with requests that hussein ’ s fate be decided by the iraqis themselves or another international court . iran , which waged a bloody eight-year war against hussein ’ s iraq in the 1980s , announced monday it was preparing to file a suit against hussein in the international criminal court in the hague .
more than 300,000 iranians died in the war from 1980-1988 , including thousands in poison gas attacks waged by iraqi troops . “ i hope we can defend iranians ' rightful demands at a proper place , ” a government spokesman told a news conference . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. forces capture saddam hussein u.s. officials confirmed on sunday they had captured former iraqi dictator saddam hussein near his hometown of tikrit .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .

“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .

his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .

“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 european press review : saddam captured , but iraqi problems still persist the european press on monday focused on the arrest of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , but stressed it would n't necessarily make life easier for coalition forces in iraq . the spanish daily el mundo commented on the extraordinary images of saddam hussein 's capture , saying " whoever saw the american video footage was surprised at how compliantly saddam let himself be taken prisoner . "
the paper noted the irony of his peaceful surrender , pointing out that " he had demanded his followers fight to their death . "
the paper also observed that the americans deserve praise for capturing saddam alive . britain ’ s left-leaning guardian also rejoiced in saddam ’ s arrest , but pointed out that other questions remain , saying that " seizing saddam was not the primary stated aim or justification for the war .
saddam ’ s capture does not wipe that contentious slate clean .
indeed , it presents a unique opportunity to establish at last the truth of u.s. and british claims about his weapons of mass destruction and his links to al qaeda and to september 11 . "
the guardian added that saddam 's testimony may shed light on his covert dealings with the west , where he was treated more like an ally than a foe before his 1990 invasion of kuwait .
" it is vital that the world hear his full , unexpurgated testimony , " the paper wrote , stressing that " saddam was a horror of our age .
but the guilt for his deeds is not entirely his alone . " france ’ s leftist la libération writes that " the unglorious manner in which saddam was captured , without giving a fight , at the bottom of his hole , might now finally destroy the myth of saddam as saladin .
even if his role in the anti-american attacks remains unclear , even if it is not the work of his supporters , his arrest will discourage those who have been keeping up violent resistance to the occupation . "
the paper says the new regime will be aided by saddam ’ s arrest , but it points out that the opposition of the iraqis to a humiliating occupation , the frustrations born from the slow pace of reconstruction , as well as ethnic and religious divisions , remain . germany ’ s bild zeitung applauds the americans ' role in capturing saddam . " patience and perseverance have finally paid off .
the sudden capture of the cruel tyrant , saddam hussein , is a deserved american triumph .
despite some mistakes , u.s. president bush , mocked and attacked by some , can now feel validated in his fight against terror and its manipulators . "
the bild zeitung adds that " saddam ’ s fanatic followers ' dreams of a return to power are finally gone .
now the coalition of the willing has a real chance to crush terror and tackle the peaceful construction of the country .
saddam ’ s capture shows that the fight against terror takes time .
and sooner or later , osama bin laden will share saddam hussein ’ s fate . " and finally , the neue zürcher zeitung comments that " it 's not everyday that a dictator like saddam hussein is taken alive as prisoner . "
the paper draws parallels with other deposed and cruel dictators , writing that " one can imagine what would have happened had hitler been captured and judged in nuremberg after world war ii " , and pointing out that considering 12 death sentences were given and ten carried out , hitler would inevitably have met a similar fate . it observes that saddam may not belong directly to this category of criminals or mass murderers such as stalin , mao and pol pot , but if he should be given the death penalty , it would be best if it were handed down by the iraqis . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .
“ these tiny reforms won ’ t lead germany out of the crisis , ” said hermann sturm of the union of small-business owners . big boost to economy unlikely while german labor minister wolfgang clement said he expected the reforms to boost the economy by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points , others doubted that recovery would happen quickly . “ this was a long sprint for such a short leap , ” said klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
“ it is neither a strong signal for economic recovery nor long-term structural reforms . ” municipalities welcome extra money but the compromise did draw praise from local government leaders , who stand to see more funds flowing into their empty coffers . finance directors in germany 's municipalities will have an additional € 2 billion in 2004 , according to gerd landsberg of the german association of municipalities .
“ this will give us some breathing space for desperately needed investments , ” he said . germany ’ s two parliamentary chambers , the bundestag and the bundesrat , still have to vote on the compromise in the coming week for it to become law on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.12.2003 experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , left , and schröder , right , are smiling , but will the rest of the country do the same ?
germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new home-owners will get less subsidies from the government starting in 2004 . because of the subsidy cuts as well as increased health care costs , many germans will not end up with much more money in their pockets come january , economic experts said . “ this isn ’ t going to help any more , ” said herbert buscher of the halle institute for economic research , adding that he didn ’ t expect to see any effects of the tax cuts until next fall . small business representatives agreed .

germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect . talking about monday ’ s compromise on tax and welfare reforms , german chancellor gerhard schröder called it “ an absolutely respectable result . ”
his opponent , christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , said that it gave germany every option for growth . the agreement , reached after three days of secret negotiations in a parliamentary mediation committee , doesn ’ t look like the government ’ s original plans . instead of leaving an extra € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in workers ’ pockets , the tax cut now only amounts to € 7.8 billion . the cut reduction is the result of dogged negotiating by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union .
both were against a massive tax cut because they said it would increase borrowing and the german national debt . the opposition also pushed the government into encouraging legislation that will loosen hire and fire laws in germany , a major stumbling block for foreign investors . “ this agreement is a very bad decision for those affected by it , ” said michael sommer , the head of the german trade union federation .
he added that an additional 2.8 million employees would now lose their protection against getting fired . opposition leaders didn ’ t succeed in throwing out the system of industry-wide collective bargaining , vigorously defended by trade unions who traditionally support schröder ’ s social democratic party . too little too late ? the financing of the tax cut had been a major stumbling block in negotiations between government and opposition , which did n't want to ratchet up the national debt in order to finance tax cuts .
now most of the cut , an estimated € 5.3 billion , will be paid for by privatizing state property .
additionally , subsidies for commuters and home-owners will be reduced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .

german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2003 the eu question : integrate or separate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi puts on a brave face but the damage appears to be done as the summit ends .
the failure of the eu constitution summit in brussels has led to a new set of buzzwords which have little to do with “ one europe ” and more to do with “ two-speed ” reforms led by like-minded “ pioneer groups . ” the handshakes were firm but non-committal and the expressions pained after european union leaders emerged from the eu constitution summit in brussels on saturday to face an uncertain future after the talks ended in acrimony and failure .
“ to look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided , ” said british prime minister tony blair .
things may not be apocalyptic just yet , but rather than being set on the road to agreement and togetherness , the eu now seems to be progressing down the road to fragmentation , as member states position themselves for retribution .
the inability to reach agreement on the constitution and sign off on the redistribution of voting rights has thrown a number of ominous phrases and ideas into the european ether .
where once , the bloc wished to present itself as “ one europe , ” there are now talks of a “ two-speed ” eu , the formation of “ pioneer groups ” made up of like-minded member states and even dark rumors of retribution aimed at those perceived to be the architects of failure .
german veiled threats of financial revenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister jose maria aznar .
spain and poland , the countries who stubbornly held their position on the allocation of votes , have now positioned themselves in the sights of a wounded germany which had failed to secure more voting power for itself .
by refusing to adopt the proposed eu voting system that would have sealed a deal on the new constitution , josé maría aznar -lrb- picture -rrb- , the spanish prime minister , and leszek miller , his polish counterpart , now face the possibility of german financial retribution .
this may come as early as the start of next year when member states start discussing the next eu budget round .
after the divisive talks ended , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned there were " certain parallels " between the treaty negotiations and the seven-year eu budget period , which starts in 2007 .
this statement hinted at a possible budgetary squeeze on spain and poland in an attempt to force them to back down on the voting issue .
germany is the biggest net contributor to the eu budget , and has said it wants to keep spending pegged to just 1 percent of the eu 's gdp , or roughly € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- a year .
that figure is about € 25 billion a year less than many inside the european commission argue is needed to sustain aid to the poorest eu regions , including southern spain and all of poland .
warsaw-berlin relationship heading for rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister leszek miller .
such strong-arm tactics , effectively a sanction policy on fellow member states , could cause severe divisions .
“ certainly the relationship between warsaw and berlin has deteriorated over the past year , ” daniel keohane at the centre of european reform in london told dw-world , “ and this won ’ t help . ”
germany stood up for poland at the nice and copenhagen summit , keohane said , and its behavior towards germany now may cause lasting damage .
“ madrid has a different relationship with berlin .
they have dealt with each other before and have experience of each other , " keohane said .
" that division may recover sooner but things look bleak for poland . ”
just as many of the stances taken by leaders at the eu summit have reflected the habit of some nations to pander to domestic prejudices , the flexing of power by the larger states is also an increasingly common factor in eu malcontent .
however , such mutterings could well play into the hands of some at the expense of the others .
it would appear that everyone had a motive for killing the summit .
aznar could return to spain and imminent retirement following elections next march , as the defiant patriot while miller could silence his nationalist critics in poland for a few days .
for schröder and french president jacques chirac , the collapse of the talks was proof that europe could not operate with a membership of 25 nations , and provided an excuse to start talking again of a multi-speed europe with a franco-german core .
pioneer groups to drive eu forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders of the alternative eu ?
chirac took the opportunity to reopen his warnings that a europe of 25 was heading for deadlock , and that " pioneer groups " would be needed to push ahead with integration .
" this will provide an engine , an example that will allow europe to go faster , further and better , " he said , adding that the impasse was evidence of the need for a so-called “ avant-garde , ” or vanguard to push european reform in the fields of economics , defense , crime-fighting and immigration .
france , germany , belgium and luxembourg are already exploring joint initiatives with a core of like-minded states , diplomats say .
in much the same way as the “ two-speed ” concept brought about the single currency and the abolition of internal borders , those in favor of pioneer groups in the european driving seat feel that the other eu members would benefit from their direction .
plan b could lead to real split “ this is an effective tactic , ” keohane explained .
“ present an unfavorable alternative plan b and push for compromise .
however , if france and germany go ahead - and they ’ re in the kind of mood to risk something - and others join , it would be a split . ” keohane added that the logistics were complicated .
“ -lrb- france and germany -rrb- would need a separate treaty and then of course , the question is who would join them ? ”
daniel gros , director of the centre for european policy studies in brussels agrees .
" this core europe stuff is a pipe dream , " he told reuters .
gros argues that paris and berlin had forfeited much trust as leaders of the european project after they trampled on eu budget rules last month to avoid disciplinary action for their excessive deficits .
with that in mind , those countries considering joining with them would be keeping one careful eye on the exit door .
with these concepts and proposals floating around in the wake of the inconclusive summit , fears abound that the future of the eu is not just one that the member states can not agree on but one where the eu itself no longer exists as they know it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback is the eu heading towards fragmentation after failing to agree on the constitution ?

in a decision that ’ s been called “ long overdue , ” the german parliament has approved plans to build a memorial for thousands of homosexual men persecuted or killed by the nazis . the government ’ s decision is the result of more than a decade of lobbying by germany ’ s gay and lesbian federation . “ it ’ s a big success for us , ” said , günter dworek , one of the federation ’ s directors . “ germany has always had a hard time dealing with this part of its history in particular .
even after the war , the persecution of homosexuals wasn ’ t recognized , and gays continued to be treated as criminals . ” christina weiss , the government 's commissioner for culture and media policies , said the decision to approve a memorial was “ long overdue . ” " we want to and we will remember this group of victims , because we must not be allowed to be silent about what price those who revealed their sexual orientation had to pay , " she said . brutal persecution some 50,000 gays were branded criminals and degenerates by the third reich , and forced to wear a pink triangle . between 10,000 and 15,000 gays were sent to concentration camps , and many were castrated or sterilized because their sexual orientation was seen as a threat to the purity of the arian race . germany ’ s law against homosexuality was only repealed in 1969 .
in 2002 , despite objections by conservatives , the german government granted a formal pardon to homosexuals convicted under nazism . “ that pardon was a breakthrough , ” dworek said .
“ it represented a clear break with the thinking of the past . ” the government has allotted € 50,000 -lrb- $ 61,500 -rrb- for the building of the memorial , to be located in berlin ’ s central tiergarten park , near the brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the holocaust memorial that 's currently being built in berlin .

2 of 9 but tucked away is st anne 's gardens which residents campaigned to be returned to the public .
3 of 9 around it is a fence made from 16 oak tusks supporting a 45-metre steel mesh that by day appears to be a security fence .
4 of 9 but by night wardour street is illuminated by its white light ...
5 of 9 ... and its green light ...
6 of 9 .. and other colours in-between .
7 of 9 the gardens were originally part of st anne 's churchyard and contain 60,000 bodies , including the essayist william hazlet .
8 of 9 a memorial to the soho nail bomb victims was unveiled in the gardens , which are near the admiral duncan pub .
9 of 9 the next stage of the project will involve more landscaping and seating , once plans have gone to public consultation .

everyone tries to put a label on soho .
people will say it 's the gay village , it 's a residential area , it 's theatreland , it 's london 's entertainment scene , it 's a sex area and some people say it 's where you get your drugs .
it is all those things , but that 's what makes it such an interesting place to live .
i think it 's a fantastic area , it 's very exciting and great fun in many ways bringing up children here because everything is on your doorstep .
they can walk to school , we walk to the tate or jump on a bus to the science museum .
take a look around soho there 's an incredibly strong community as well .
we have a school , a church , an over-60s club , christmas bazaars , village festivals , sports days , tombolas and all the things you traditionally associate with a village .
but most children in soho are living in a flat and have very little outdoor space .
it 's cramped , there are not many places to play outside and that 's hard for them .
we approached the council about st anne 's gardens because it was a no-go area for the public , even though it was a public area .
for years it had been a place of dealing and abuse .
there was a lot of rough sleeping and all the consequences of that , faeces and needles .
various people at times had tried to improve things by planting prickly bushes and closing it at various times .
we wanted to find a long-term solution so it would become a very nice public space .
the wall of light was switched on in july 2003 soho does n't have much outdoor space and what there is , are roundabouts like soho square and golden square .
i think the project was born out of a huge sense of indignation that what little we had was n't available to us .
we wanted to generally improve the use -lsb- of the gardens -rsb- by having events like sports days and things that have happened traditionally like the soho festival .
we consulted people , got plans drawn up and found that the biggest concern was security .
what 's the point of doing nice things inside the space if no-one will actually go there ?
that 's why we have the fence , what we call the wall of light .
we spent a year drawing up the plans , we had to get permission from the church and involve so many people .
it was a big learning curve .
the wall of light was switched on in july this year , the whole street was packed with people .
we wanted to create tranquillity in the heart of soho katherine william-powlett we had old ladies from the over-60s club , children , the school , transvestites and people coming out of clubs .
we had a really good cross section of everyone that makes up soho .
it -lsb- the wall of light -rsb- tends to provoke a strong reaction .
some people hate it , but overall i think people are very pleased because of the positive impact it has had on what was a no-go area .
in our survey about 80 % liked the look of it and 100 % think it improves the gardens .
i think that 's a damn good result .
it is innovative and it was an opportunity to secure the space and light up that part of wardour street which was quite dark .
we have made it a more attractive place for people to come so they wo n't be intimidated .
we wanted to create tranquillity in the heart of soho .
it 's changed the character of the space .
that 's all we wanted , an open space we could feel safe in and enjoy .

ebola kills in up to 90 % of cases , causing massive internal bleeding - and there are few options for doctors .
the latest treatment , developed by the us army research institute , works to inhibit blood clotting , and was injected into ebola-infected monkeys .
a third of the animals survived their infection , while all of those given no treatment died as result of ebola .
the results of the experiments were published in the medical journal the lancet , and offer a possible weapon against sudden outbreaks of the highly contagious virus in africa .
so far , outbreaks have been confined mostly to remote areas of africa , although experts fear outbreaks in major cities , where the chances of large numbers of cases are much higher .
killer outbreak the latest outbreak , in the republic of congo , has so far killed 29 people , while an epidemic in the same region in 2001 claimed more than 100 lives .
our results have great clinical implications dr thomas geisbert , us army medical research institute of infectious diseases the us army treatment is called rnapc2 , and works on a chemical chain of events that leads to blood coagulation .
despite the fact that one of the symptoms is extensive bleeding , ebola is thought to cause most damage because it boosts blood coagulation , causing the failure of major organs .
the drug was designed to interfere with the coagulation process and hopefully buy time for the body 's natural defences to destroy the ebola viruses .
survivors in total , 26 monkeys were infected with ebola , and nine given the drug .
six of these survived , and are in good health nine months after the study ended .
dr thomas geisbert , who led the study , said : " our results have great clinical implications , since our treatment approach of ebola haemorrhagic fever targets the disease process rather than replication of the infectious agent .
" our findings raise the possibility that rnapc2 could be useful in the treatment of other viral haemorrhagic fevers . "

the stop the war coalition said finding saddam in a hole proved he was not masterminding iraqi resistance .
spokesman andrew burgin said the " we got him " line from paul bremer , iraq 's us administrator , was " very cowboy " .
and new york-based human rights watch said there should be no " political show trial " for saddam .
mr burgin said violence and instability in iraq was largely due to the " heavy-handed " nature of the british and american forces .
" this is a pathetic , isolated figure .
he was apprehended in an underground cell that he himself had created with a single air vent , cut off largely from the outside world .
" he has been allegedly directing the operation of so-called resistance from what it now appears to be a hole in the ground .
he obviously had been cut off since the fall of baghdad .
" it 's quite incredible that he was built up by the british and americans as the person who was single-handedly masterminding the resistance .
" in large areas of iraq , the heavy-handed nature of the british and american forces in the operations is what is fuelling the resistance , not some loyalty to saddam .
" to some extent it shows how ludicrous the whole project was in the first place . "
while people would welcome the capture of the iraqi dictator , they would be " just as happy to see the end of occupation by foreign forces , and that is what is fuelling the resistance " .
pull-out call mr burgin said it was ridiculous to assume that saddam would have any specific knowledge of where supposed weapons of mass destruction might have been disposed of .
he said now saddam was gone there was no reason for the us and uk not to pull out .
human rights watch said saddam 's apprehension was a " welcome development " , but stressed how important it was for the iraqi people to have " ownership of his trial " .
" but it 's equally important that the trial is not be perceived as vengeful justice .
" for that reason , international jurists must be involved in the process .
" the iraqi governing council should partner the united nations to create an accountability process that works .
there wo n't be a second chance to do this right . "

the stop the war coalition said finding saddam in a hole proved he was not masterminding iraqi resistance .
spokesman andrew burgin said the " we got him " line from paul bremer , iraq 's us administrator , was " very cowboy " .
and new york-based human rights watch said there should be no " political show trial " for saddam .
mr burgin said violence and instability in iraq was largely due to the " heavy-handed " nature of the british and american forces .
" this is a pathetic , isolated figure .
he was apprehended in an underground cell that he himself had created with a single air vent , cut off largely from the outside world .
" he has been allegedly directing the operation of so-called resistance from what it now appears to be a hole in the ground .
he obviously had been cut off since the fall of baghdad .
" it 's quite incredible that he was built up by the british and americans as the person who was single-handedly masterminding the resistance .
" in large areas of iraq , the heavy-handed nature of the british and american forces in the operations is what is fuelling the resistance , not some loyalty to saddam .
" to some extent it shows how ludicrous the whole project was in the first place . "
while people would welcome the capture of the iraqi dictator , they would be " just as happy to see the end of occupation by foreign forces , and that is what is fuelling the resistance " .
pull-out call mr burgin said it was ridiculous to assume that saddam would have any specific knowledge of where supposed weapons of mass destruction might have been disposed of .
he said now saddam was gone there was no reason for the us and uk not to pull out .
human rights watch said saddam 's apprehension was a " welcome development " , but stressed how important it was for the iraqi people to have " ownership of his trial " .
" but it 's equally important that the trial is not be perceived as vengeful justice .

if their action fails they know they could be left with a large legal bill that could run into tens of thousands of pounds .

campaigners have been awarded legal aid to cover the costs of the judicial review .

they have written to primary schools throughout the uk requesting financial backing and have also enlisted the support of celebrities including singers cerys matthews and bryn terfel , actor rhys ifans and snooker player matthew stevens .
" our campaign at hermon will be a test case which could influence many similar challenges all over the country , " added mrs nicholas .
" if the verdict is finally secured and hermon school saved from closure , the costs of the case will be born by the county council .
" all donations will subsequently be returned to the individuals who have contributed . "
pembrokeshire council 's case is that it does not have the funds to expand hermon school which is only supposed to have a 46-pupil capacity .
it says a single area primary school would be more cost effective and provide better education standards .

aberdeen university bacteriologist professor hugh pennington said organic birds could be the biggest carriers of the campylobacter bug .
it causes chronic diarrhoea and is the most common cause of food poisoning in white meat hitting 400,000 people a year .
prof pennington wants the scottish executive to ensure birds are free from the bug .
the annoying thing is that for most people who will suffer food poisoning this christmas it could have been easily avoidable prof hugh pennington a member of the scottish food advisory committee of the food standards agency , prof pennington said he was concerned about the bug 's capabilities .
" campylobacter is not going away .
the latest studies show that about 60 % of chickens are infected - and i would be staggered if it was not the same rate in turkeys , " he said .
" they may look appetising but some have thousands of organisms and if they are not cooked properly people will pick up the bug .
organic fears " it is also rampant among wild birds so that means pheasants and partridges also have high rates .
" in fact a study in denmark among chickens has shown that organic birds had even higher rates than non-organic birds . "
organic birds live longer and have more time to spread the bug .
" people should treat their turkeys as if they have come straight off the farm , " prof pennington added .
" there is a strong chance that their turkey will have bacteria on it .
' food poisoning ' " the annoying thing is that for most people who will suffer food poisoning this christmas it could have been easily avoidable .
it is not an act of god . "
for most sufferers food poisoning will mean two or three days of sickness but in extreme cases - such as in the sick or old - it can prove fatal .
but if a bird is cooked thoroughly most of the risk of food poisoning is gone and to avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen separate implements should be used .
storing the bird on the bottom shelf in the refrigerator - so it does not drip on other food - washing hands thoroughly , using separate chopping boards and defrosting thoroughly frozen turkeys can also help prevent infections .
george paterson , director of food standards agency scotland , said : " most food poisoning incidents are easily prevented and with a little extra thought and planning everybody can enjoy a delicious and safe christmas dinner . "

but the lucky tea stall in india 's north-western city of ahmedabad has become a landmark , even if its tables are flanked by muslim graves .
people from all walks of life come to relish a cup of tea and a famous maska bun -lrb- buttered bun with jam -rrb- .
the graves form an integral part of the tea shop. located close to the banks of the sabarmati river in the mirzapur district of old ahmedabad , in gujarat state .
the graves are kept according to tradition , with a boundary mark on each to leave them untouched .
kerala heritage patrons have only a vague idea of how the stall came to be on a graveyard .
ahmedabad is wracked with tensions between hindus and muslims and no one was too willing to discuss it .
i always wanted to ask about the history of the shop but i could never gather the courage ramesh dutt , patron however , krishnan kutti nair , a malayalee hindu who migrated from the southern indian state of kerala to serve as manager , says the shop was started about 50 years ago by a certain k mohammed from calicut in kerala .
mr nair has been serving here since 1973 .
" it started as a very small kiosk selling pan -lrb- betel leaves -rrb- and tea but it slowly grew , " he says .
" the original owner , who died some years back , entered into a partnership with a mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- -based party . "
although covered by the tea shop , the graveyard remains untouched .
a tree trunk still springs through the roof of the shop .
the graveyard is respected - a tree still grows through the roof arvind bhai , an employee for the past 19 years , says : " the quality of our tea remains the same as it was when the shop started .
we have had customers who have been coming here for years .
" once someone comes here , they return to take tea with friends . "
mr bhai admits some people are sceptical before entering a premises where graves flank the tables .
" but once they overcome their fears , they become regulars , " he says .
ramesh dutt has been one such regular for the past 10 years .
he first came here as a student of a nearby college but still comes regularly even though his house is now a considerable distance away .
" ' these graves have always intrigued me .

the tale of the demon barber of fleet street - a particular favourite with amateur operatic groups the world over - sees a rare outing for a musical on the covent garden stage .
in general , the roh leaves the musicals to the west end , but it has brought together a cast of opera stars for this production .
but it is taking a risk by staging the production because as a publicly-funded opera house it has a loyal core audience that expects the highest standards .
but according to director of opera elaine padmore , ticket sales are proving the roh was right to be take a detour over the festive season .
audience mix stephen sondheim 's creation is a complex production - a borderline musical / opera rather than a play with music .
it is expected to attract a mixture of regular opera-goers as well as those who may not have visited the famous auditorium before , according to ms padmore .
but she does admit the macabre nature of the story will not be to everyone 's tastes .
" it is dark and dramatic , with a touch of cannibalism , " she explained .
but with just nine performances being staged , the seasoned opera buff will not have long to wait before the usual fare of classics and ground-breaking productions return .
sweeney todd is a co-production with the lyric theatre in chicago , which ran the show last year .
in the title role in the us was the welsh singing sensation bryn terfel , who wowed the critics , and ms padmore is confident the covent garden stage is even more suited to the show because it is less cavernous than its chicago counterpart .
for its london transfer an entirely new cast has been employed , with sir thomas allen , known for his outspoken views on the arts , taking on sweeney todd .
pie shop he has previously accused opera singers of " dumbing down " , criticising crossover artists such as bond and russell watson in their populist approach to marketing their art .
the character of sweeney todd is cast out of society only to return to seek his revenge , killing his victims in his barber 's chair before sending them down a chute to the pie shop below .
" although it is a witty and clever script , there are not many laughs to be had when sweeney todd is around , " said ms padmore .
sondheim visited the cast and crew during the final week of rehearsals to cast his eye over the roh 's version of his famous composition .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- commonwealth and mugabe : your reactions home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 15 december , 2003 , 09:34 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version commonwealth and mugabe : your reactions click here to listen to our talking point discussion zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe says he is pulling his country out of the commonwealth with immediate effect .
he said he did not accept the decision made at the abuja summit , to maintain zimbabwe 's suspension indefinitely .
zimbabwe was suspended from the 54-nation commonwealth last year after president mugabe was accused of rigging his own re-election .
a group of african states wanted the suspension lifted , arguing that dialogue is the only way forward while other members say zimbabwe ca n't be re-admitted unless it introduces democratic reforms .
how should the international community deal with zimbabwe ?
can the commonwealth influence the behaviour of its members ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : the commonwealth is not being fair on zimbabwe .
it is mugabe as an individual they should punish , not the innocent people of zimbabwe .
why do n't britain and usa overthrow him the way they did to saddam .
he is even worse than saddam !
donnell chinave , england mugabe made an absolutely right decision to quit the commonwealth because it is an organisation that , unfortunately , is being run along racial lines and hypocrisy .
poor member states are being coerced overtly and covertly to follow c / wealth values as they are being interpreted from the perspective of white " big brothers " of the organization - britain , australia , new zealand and canada .
others particularly , black member states are being forced to accept " junior brother status " through a lot of dirty diplomacy that include aid .
this is what is destroying the commonwealth .
in the eyes of tony blair mugabe committed the sin of seizing land from white settlers and giving it to his landless fellow africans .
but in doing so he was absolutely right because , the british government , since the inception of the commonwealth has not committed itself seriously to resolving the colonial imbalances it caused in its former colonies .
i wish all african leaders would follow his footsteps .
nyamita matonjeni , zimbabwe the commonwealth was created as a collection of independent nations who were once british colonies - in order to help guide the first steps of these new countries and to provide guidance and help to them as they made their own way in the world .
it is a body of membership open to any nation that seeks to modernise and improve the lot of the common man , under the umbrella of just law and democracy .
why would mugabe be interested in being a part of such an organisation , and why would we want him there ?
it is now for the people of zimbabwe to decide where their future lies .
iain howe , netherlands -lrb- uk expat -rrb- how could the commonwealth deal if not by suspending zimbabwe further ?
pacifica , zimbabwe unfortunately when you witness what is going on in zimbabwe you feel hopeless .
as you think that there is light at the end of the tunnel , the one person , the so called " liberator " -lrb- is n't this how his african comrades see him ? -rrb- does all he can in his power -lrb- which he unfortunately still has quite a lot of -rrb- to assure that this country goes to hell before he does .
how could the commonwealth deal if not by suspending zimbabwe further , until some positive results would be produced ?
as long as the heads of the neighbouring countries will continue to support mugabe , i 'm afraid the future will not only be bleak for this country but also for the rest of africa .
the matter of the fact is that zimbabwe at the moment is hell for more than 80 % of its population -lrb- and an insignificant part of it consists of whites -rrb- .
pacifica , zimbabwe robert gabriel mugabe is our source of pride .
there is no better qualified person to deliver to the zimbabwean people their dignity than pres mugabe .
why you may ask .
you need a man with a stiff back to salvage your belongings from the west .
c 'mon folks you know as well as i do that ownership of the means of production , land being top of the list bestows pride , dignity , both political and economic freedom , respect and above all independence .
do you have any quarrel with that ?
that 's what everybody wants is n't it ?
so give mugabe a break please .
pelontle brewer mosweu , botswana it is unfortunate that mugabe still does not believe that he is the problem of zimbabwe .
the hope that was zimbabwe in 1980 has become a disaster of unimaginable magnitude .
zimbabwe can still be the land of promise it was in 1980 but that must be after president mugabe has gone .
ebisike a.o , abuja nigeria i think mugabe has made the greatest mistake by pulling out of the commonwealth .
he should know that the world is a web which every nation is part of and the commonwealth is part of it .
so , he ca n't be alone at all .
davies zinnass , nigeria the only reason why the so called african leaders support mugabe is because they are all the same .
they muzzle the people , reward cronies , loot the country and pretend to be statesmen .
it 's an african tragedy .
a yohannes , canada the people of zimbabwe are the only ones who can save the country for them and the future generations trevor jongwe , chinhoyi mugabe has had his time .
he 's now too old , too sick mentally and physically and too scared .
he is acting like a trapped and wounded animal - lashing out at all and any who may threaten his position .
if he had followed the great mandela 's footsteps and let a successor carry on from his early success he would have gone down in history as a global icon of freedom and fair play .
now he 's going to end his days violently and be remembered as a foolish old man in the shadows of amin , and ceausescu .
as for the commonwealth - well it 's passed it sell by date now anyway and should be disbanded and fade away into the past .
we have no oil or other coveted resources like iraq - so no superpower will bother to help us .
the people did n't get the land in the end anyway , so now they 're hungry , angry and need change to simply survive .
the people of zimbabwe are the only ones who can save the country for them and the future generations .
pamberi na zimbabwe .
trevor jongwe , chinhoyi a point of information to our african brothers and sisters who voice their support for mugabe : we 're not calling for his removal because of his anti-colonial stance or economic mismanagement -lrb- both are political points on which only the people of zimbabwe must be the judge -rrb- .
no , we 're calling for his removal because of the 20,000 dead ndebele , who were massacred during the early 80s .
robert sharp , edinburgh , uk zimbabweans are in reality under siege , we can not exercise basic rights amos phiri , zimbabwe i believe in the just ruling made by the commonwealth .
why would a leader who has failed to uphold his country 's constitution be allowed to lie to the world ?
zimbabweans are in reality under siege , we can not exercise basic rights and we shudder why other african leaders are so eager to have mugabe and not the people to be a member of the commonwealth .
is it that they would want to have the same sympathy when they happen to one day practise dictatorship in their countries ?
to all responsible world leaders it is high time dictatorship is eradicated we have suffered enough .
amos phiri , zimbabwe zimbabwe , it 's time you feed your own destiny likwa moyo , usa there are two hungry wolves inside every one of us , so the old tale goes .
the first wolf is proud , unmerciful , commits atrocious things , malicious , corrupt , knowledge to do evil , and without affection .
the other wolf within has peace , joy , love , working for the good of others , respect , mature .
which one wins ?
that depends on which one you feed .
zimbabwe , it 's time you feed your own destiny .
likwa moyo , usa the commonwealth is a voluntary association and can not take the place of a security body in a world that has thus far shunned a democratic global system of security .
no country on the planet can withstand the united action of the rest of the world 's nations .
this is the only global system that will give everyone , from the best armed soldier to the most fragile baby , peace .
can we start with a surrender of the veto power in the security council by those who are still celebrating victory in world war two ?
to achieve peace we must end war mentality .
ndumiso dlamini , south africa odd how many africans living in safety in other commonwealth countries choose to rubbish the organisation which in no small part creates that security .
john , france viva mugabe , how i wish we had more men in africa like him .
god bless zimbabwe !
lubengu joe , zambia i think that zimbabweans must rise up and kick mugabe out of their land now .
he has refused to understand that his people are seriously suffering and that his continued stay in office will definitely not help them as a nation .
as such , i implore other african leaders who can not see beyond their nose on this issue by siding him , to have a sensibly and logical understanding of this all important issue .
alexander marlin , nigeria no country on earth can go it alone gordon , uk mugabe should realise that isolation is not the same as sovereignty .
no country on earth can go it alone .
he should step down because he has been an abject failure as a leader and an abuser of human rights .
his unilateral decision to pull out of the commonwealth without even consulting the cabinet , let alone parliament , shows what an arrogant tyrant he truly is .
gordon , uk whether we like it or not mugabe has law on his side .
not because what he is doing is legal but because britain has had its fingers burnt by iraq .
it can not call for regime change at the un simply because it is illegal under the un charter and i note that when britain needs an ally , where is the us ?
there is simply no way of imposing a military solution on mugabe .
but we should be quite clear on the matter we should be applying for un sanctions on mugabe 's regime with a view to creating the civil disorder that unseats him , then prosecute him in the court of human rights tony , welling kent the members of the commonwealth were right to continue the ban matt , germany the commonwealth is a good organisation fighting for human rights , education , democracy , etc , as well as providing a ground for trade .
mugabe is nothing other than a dictator our for his own interests .
perhaps his reasons are worthy and his methods ill-advised , however one thing is clear , before his so called land reforms zimbabwe was a financially self sustaining country .
now unemployment stands at over 65 % and inflation at over 600 % .
he has laid down laws which make it almost impossible for anyone to oppose him and is creating what can only be described as a dictatorship !
the members of the commonwealth were right to continue the ban and good on them for standing up for the rights of the common zimbabweans .
matt , germany president mugabe , you have my support .
it is time african leaders should wake up and define their destiny .
commonwealth or whatever will not do that .
colonialism has done more harm to african development than any other modern crime .
not only that , it is the same colonial masters that are collaborating with some african leaders who stash away stolen funds in their banks .
i hope other african leaders / countries would emulate mugabe and pull out of the deadwood called commonwealth .
sylvester i. okoro , usaka-ukwu city , nigeria / usa economic sanctions , cultural and sporting boycotts all proved effective in ending apartheid in south africa .
mugabe is systematically oppressing all who oppose him with the exact same methods and mechanisms deployed by the white regime we in south africa are glad to be rid of .
why should the international community respond any differently to zimbabwe ?
or are we to accept that black rulers should be given more latitude to abuse simply because their victims are the same colour as the tyrant ?
cliff smith , south africa so be it - let the man do what he will .
no one has made any effort to stop anything he has done since the 1980s , so why stop now ?
the country can only get worse and more people can only die .
why now the sudden loud speakers on the issues ?
too much too late .
tsitsi , uk the expulsion is one step in the right direction mw , harare , zimbabwe the expulsion is one step in the right direction .
this regime has let down a lot of young lives in zimbabwe and has reduced a once prosperous nation to rubble .
they are solely to blame for all this but they point fingers at everyone else but themselves .
laws have since been put in place to kill off the little that remains of democracy .
vote rigging , serious as it may be , aside , this regime is incompetent .
i 'm utterly disappointed that the world has afforded the old man a place to air his long and venomous speeches at the world summit that 's on-going in switzerland .
he sounds like he is fighting for ' his people ' when in actual fact what he is doing on the ground is the opposite .
help us change governance in this country .
mw , harare , zimbabwe if i was a leader , i would have done the same as mr mugabe has decided - to get zimbabwe out of this group of neo colonialists and their african puppets .
the commonwealth has nothing more than promoting neo colonialism .
this organ , like the un , has nothing to offer people in developing countries .
with the global situation , its main function is to protect western interests all over the world .
they are going to destroy all of us using their organizations .
why do n't we all leave them and strengthen our african unity ?
charles rwezaula richard , tanzania mugabe , like many african leaders , has two things on mind .
money and power .
he is corrupted beyond imagination , using the power he has to serve one man : mugabe .
who cares if he is in or out the commonwealth ?
his country is bleeding and shredded into pieces .
he feels no pain .
it is the zimbabweans that are paying high price .
my heart goes out for half of the universe nations that are under dictatorships one way or the other .
the names , languages and nationalities vary but one thing remains : the sufferings of all these unfortunate humans .
ronda , uk , uae the commonwealth needs to examine the human rights records of all member states and suspend them accordingly .
several african commonwealth states have leaders who came to power through flawed elections , and have human rights records that are arguably worse than zimbabwe 's .
i wonder if zimbabwe was not suspended because the president rightfully seized land which was acquired from zimbabweans by force and gave it back to the zimbabwean people .
angu , canada of what use is the commonwealth in the first place ?
personally , i think it should be rubbished .
how can we as africans continue to respect and bow down to a queen of a foreign land ?
we have our own traditional kings and queens and we do n't even respect them that much , and giving the ultimate respect to elizabeth because she 's white .
this is a shame .
jibola , nigerian in canada the issue of land redistribution is a thorny issue but was handled poorly by mr. mugabe .
in civilized politics , he could have achieved his aim using the legal apparatus available to him without driving his country into chaos .
all he needed to do was to make parliament -lrb- which his party controls anyway -rrb- pass a land property tax law with step-wise and escalating tax liability as the size of one 's land increases -lrb- squeezing by the book ! -rrb- .
tax breaks will be available to those who relinquish portions of their land to the government .
i guess african leaders prefer to achieve aims by use of force and not by brains .
a osei , usa what do the former colonies of britain gain from the commonwealth ?
hughes wurakomatitu , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's exit marks the beginning of the gradual end of the commonwealth .
what do the former colonies of britain gain from the commonwealth ?
mugabe has shown the way and others will follow , but how soon ?
hughes wurakomatitu , zimbabwe i appreciated president mugabe decision for pulling out his country , because there is nothing to gain for being commonwealth member .
abiel kon , canada as a son of rhodesian born immigrants , me , and my whole family have watched with great sadness as zimbabwe has been destroyed economically and politically under mugabe .
it comes as no surprise that zimbabwe has been kicked out of the commonwealth .
i feel there is no hope for zimbabwe under mugabe , there 's been no hope in 10 years .
the international community and commonwealth can put restrictions on mugabe but they wo n't work .
as long as mugabe is in power , we ca n't do anything that will be effective in making zimbabwe great again .
ca , usa mugabe like most african leaders is power drunk akua afriyie , ghana mugabe like most african leaders is power drunk .
it 's time for a power-change in zimbabwe as the old adage says " water left for too long in the flask stinks " likewise mugabe and his government , his actions are a violations of the fundamental rights of the people of zimbabwe and it 's time .
i agree with the commonwealth suspension though it is at the expense of the good people of zimbabwe .
akua afriyie , ghana if he is pulling out , so be it .
on a second note , i would have thought that a major decision like that should have been taken by the country 's parliament .
zimbabwe is greater than mugabe and his party .
as an african , he might have a rethink and rescind his decision after pressure from big brother ' obasanjo of nigeria .
akinlolu oluwamuyiwa , lagos , nigeria the commonwealth has become a dinosaur themba nkala , south africa mugabe is right in pulling his country out of the commonwealth and i think other countries should also evaluate membership to an organisation that refuses to engage or tolerate the views of developing countries .
what is the use of the commonwealth in any case ?
the commonwealth has become a dinosaur .
themba nkala , south africa leaving the commonwealth is the least of zimbabweans ' problems .
mugabe is .
get rid of him and the zimbabweans can start to rebuild their lives .
wairimu , kenyan in the uk good riddance !
zimbabwe has no place at any international gathering .
expelling him from all international forums would perhaps make the people realise that enough is enough and up rise to topple him like in georgia .
gordon mbongwe , cape town mugabe is not the legitimate ruler of zimbabwe , so all he says and does has nothing to do with zimbabweans joseph chibvo , uk we zimbabweans really know what we need .
we need a regime change , full stop .
let 's call a spade a spade , mugabe and company needed to go yesterday .
we do n't care about commonwealth membership etc .
that does not change our situation .
mugabe is not the legitimate ruler of zimbabwe , so all he says and does has nothing to do with zimbabweans .
please mr bush , help us to remove this evil dictator and do n't bother about the un , commonwealth and other talk shops .
joseph chibvo , uk the commonwealth is not being sincere , they said the elections in nigeria were not free nor fair but they could do nothing .
they did not make a big fuss out of it because that would have disrupted the white members continuous attack on zimbabwe whose real sin is driving the white farmers away from the land .
if the commonwealth is genuine in its desire for democracy and fairness then it should have done the same thing on nigeria and tony blair could not even have talked about the return of pakistan .
i think mugabe has done the right thing to get out of it and i wish sa , mozambique and zambia did something other than just empty words in exposing the paternal approach of the white members .
zvese marara , norway its very unfortunate that the aging dictator and his zanu-pf thugs have decided to quit the club without a national consensus .
his latest move shows the man has no regard for democracy .
the decision should have been made in parliament not at a party forum .
shepherd , harare mugabe has done nothing wrong to the people of zimbabwe , in fact he is just trying to correct the colonial imbalances created by the white regime period .
silver bhebe , zimbabwe , chinhoyi what is there to gain by being in the commonwealth anyway ?
kieron , ireland what is there to gain by being in the commonwealth anyway ?
we in ireland left it long ago and have never looked back .
who wants to be bowing to some foreign countries queen ?
so much for all this so called " patriotism " being bounded around the planet. and as for mugabe , well his card is marked and the people never forget ... no matter how long it takes .
kieron , ireland mugabe is a poor leader and visionary .
he is selfish as seen by the fact that the majority of forcibly-taken farms are not in the hands of the black populace but in the hands of the ruling elite .
ross , zimbabwe it is unfortunate that some african leaders support mugabe for his dictatorship and mistreating his own people .
do not promote his silly and unreasonable behaviour , instead talk to him and let him see sense .
if you are not wise enough to make him understand , please stop it .
the president of zambia is a qualified and respected lawyer and now that he is a politician , he has changed all what people respected him for .
he is now trying to follow the dictators of tomorrow who are looking forward to stay in power for the rest of their lives .
mugabe is zambia 's neighbour but that does not mean it should support every rubbish he does .
gudel , zambian in uk if tony blair had done his job properly and gone after mugabe as well as saddam hussain , this would never have happened .
jared griffiths , uk i am very sure there are millions of zimbabweans that are a lot more intelligent than mugabe and would do a better job at leading the country muhammed , lagos mugabe is an old corrupt leader whose time as zimbabwe 's leader had run out years ago .
come on , does he think he is the only one capable of ruling zimbabwe ?
i am very sure there are millions of zimbabweans that are a lot more intelligent than mugabe and would do a better job at leading the country .
i do n't know why one man is allowed to make the lives of millions miserable .
this is unfair and simply unacceptable .
mugabe 's withdrawal from the commonwealth is a sign of his state of mind .
he now believes he is above criticism , that he is above all zimbabweans .
his land reform policy was nothing more than a populist move for perpetuate his grip on the poor citizens of zimbabwe .
blaming the country 's problems on colonialism is an insult to the entire population of the country , and the rest of africa .
he should , and must , go .

the chancellor delivered an upbeat view of the economy but admitted that the uk will have to borrow £ 10bn more than originally predicated in april .
he also revealed that the measure of inflation would be switched from the retail price index to the harmonised consumer price index which is used by the eu .
mr brown also announced a series of measures aimed at widening childcare provision and bringing more young people out of poverty .
what did you think of the chancellor 's pre-budget report ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : i know the uk economy is buoyant , i know the chancellor is borrowing significant sums to balance the books ...
what i do n't know is where the money is going .
paul , belgium -lrb- expat -rrb- it sounds to me like an election gimmick j b lear , witham it sounds to me like an election gimmick .
all about child care and nothing about pensioners , their poverty and the poor state of care homes .
today 's papers predict an increase of over 8 % in council tax next year .
j b lear , witham there is no viable option for our country other than to support gordon brown 's spending programme .
this government has at least stopped the rot and begun to clear up the devastation of four terms of the tories .
does anyone really think that the country could take another bout of that ?
robert crosby , nottingham , uk when people praise redistribution so highly , let it be remembered that a lot of what the low paid get back is money taken from them in income tax and national insurance in the first place because the starting point for tax and nic is so low .
brian w , chelmsford , uk with reference to mr brown 's increase in borrowing by a further 10 billion , resulting in an approximate deficit of £ 47 billion .
please justify how a man who is in financial control of the countries biggest company i.e. great briton uk plc has still got a job at all ?
any other person would have been dismissed billions of pounds ago !
martin spencer , telford what a lot of mean-spirited and selfish people there are out there .
the corollary of their argument is that many children would be living in poverty and misery - as they were in the 1980s .
gordon brown is a redistributive chancellor , giving us the best economy in europe and dishing out some of the proceeds to prevent hardship .
the tory alternative may mean lower taxes - for those lucky enough to have a job .
many jobs have been gained under gordon brown 's policies - one of them could be yours .
think about that before complaining .
andrew , burnley , uk there is far to much waste on so-called management consultants and sundry spivs .
taxes are already too high , but at least he is going to do something with the lunatic " planning " system that has made housing unaffordable in the uk - preferably take an axe to it !
the barker report that accompanied the statement was a breath of fresh air !
mark , hitchin , uk i know of people who will be entitled to more child tax credits and they will be used as spending money on their next annual holiday !
susan , uk i 'm annoyed that people without kids seem to think they are the only ones paying tax !
my husband and i have two children and we will not be better off under the new proposals , however i know of people who will be entitled to more child tax credits and they will be used as spending money on their next annual holiday !
this does need to be addressed at the next budget .
susan , uk if i had to ask for a loan that mr brown will be asking for , i 'd be having sleepless nights .
sleep well gordon !
mh , hinckley great , so now childcare is going to cost me more than it does already .
mr brown is pricing people like me out of the uk job market .
fortunately , i can always emigrate and thus earn more and have a lower cost of living .
its getting to the stage where the majority of graduates will be better off abroad than here - surely this is crazy !
sarah , cambridge the economy faces a good many challenges but gordon brown is the best chancellor we 've had in decades .
at least he can think beyond the next election , unlike his tory predecessors .
no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible .
ron , uk if i 'd been that far out on my budget estimate , i 'd have been fired .
scott , uk those in glass houses should not throw stones peter , plymouth ironic really is n't it .
in the same week as mr brown expresses criticism about the mounting burden of debt on families , he is quite happy to burden the tax payer with ever increasing levels of public debt .
so , who is more prudent ?
is it joe public who borrows to buy a better house or a new car ?
or is it a chancellor who borrows to fund increasingly bureaucratic and wasteful government departments .
those in glass houses should not throw stones .
peter , plymouth why give tax credits to families earning upwards of £ 50,000 a year to look after their children !
do n't pensioners struggling by on £ 71.50 a week deserve recognition for their efforts in building up this country so that these young families have the benefit of their hard graft through the 30s , 40s and 50s ?
come on brown look after those who rebuilt this country after the war .
john , birmingham many of the responses on this page seem unbelievably selfish , along the lines of " what 's in it for me ? "
i take heart from a news headline published on the bbc website earlier today -lrb- and very quickly consigned to the archive -rrb- : " uk moving up poverty league " with experts noting " real progress " by the government .
credit where credit is due .
noel , london he should have scrapped child benefit .
if you choose to have a child , pay for it .
it is utterly immoral to expect anyone else to have to go out to work and pay for another 's choice to have children .
joe , uk joe , uk , misses the point about kids .
you need to encourage people to have kids otherwise there will be no-one around to prop up your pension scheme .
i know you pay your own way and you save for the future , but please bear in mind that without customers and workers in 30 years time the company that has promised to pay you a pension will be gone .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire £ 10 billion more than planned ?
unacceptable .
even a banana republic like south africa does better than that .
perhaps mr brown should go for lessons with trevor manuel -lrb- the south african minister of finance -rrb- to learn how to spend frugally .
disgraceful !
stefan , london let me see , i work my way up from being a student , get taxed more to help public services ?
pay for my own pension , have private health care yet even though i use less i am expected to pay more , we are paying through our noses for a war we did n't want , and paying for asylum for umpteen thousands of people , why do n't we all just become unemployed , have kids and get more money .
why should those who have worked blooming hard to earn a great wage be penalised for it ?
jo , aberdeen if you want good public services you have to pay for them gwilym , london good grief !
what a bunch of moaning , mean spirited people the british are !
the simple fact is if you want good public services you have to pay for them .
if you want european levels of public transport , health service , social services etc. you have to pay european levels of tax -lrb- which are on average are a lot higher than here -rrb- .
i agree that there are definite savings that can be made by better management but in the end you get what you pay for .
i do n't agree with many things the government has done but the increase in finance for the public sector is a welcome change from the penny pinching of previous governments .
gwilym , london once again , we are being asked to subsidise other people 's lifestyle .
having children is a matter of choice , not right .
i am not expected to pay for your car , satellite television or holiday in florida - why expect me to pay for your children ?
philip , southend-on-sea my mate 's father died at home today , because there was no hospice place for him .
around the corner , an elderly lady , living in sheltered accommodation was murdered last week .
now gordon , you show me how your taxing has benefited my community ?
ian , birkenhead allowing couples with children to file tax returns together so that single income families can benefit from both tax-free allowances .
it is hard enough to raise children on two incomes and is becoming impossible on a single income which reduces each year as more tax is taken from it .
david , frinton simplification of the tax system is would save huge amounts of cash .
combine everything into income tax - it is after all the fairest tax we have - the greater your ability to pay - the more you pay - simple !
lee , stevenage why why why do i always come out of a budget worse off ?
karl , northants , uk why why why do i always come out of a budget worse off ?
i do n't smoke , i 'm reasonably fit , i own my own home and car and have two children .
mr brown , what the hell are you wasting my money on ?
stop giving it away to those who refuse to work for a start , and get rid of middle management in money eating monsters such as the nhs .
karl , northants , uk i like to think i am a compassionate and charitable person .
however , like karl , i am tired of my husband and i having to work hard to maintain a standard of living that others on a lot less income -lrb- and therefore a lot less responsibility at work -rrb- are maintaining with tax credits and other forms of supplementary income from the state .
i have three children and have financially shot myself in the foot by getting an education and a decent job .
new labour has done little for the middle income households - these are not the previous ' middle classes ' , they are hardworking individuals who have sufficient drive and determination to not want to be supported by the state .
lesley-anne , uk there would be no need for any further tax rises if this wretched government stopped wasting our money and stopped paying people to do nothing .
philip cleveland , uk perhaps if the £ 6bn or so the chancellor and the government have so far on a fruitless war , then perhaps we might have seen more value for our money , i.e. better services etc .
this government is just full of spin .
say one thing , do another , and then shamelessly at the end of the day do what you promised you would n't do / or would n't happen .
john , aberdeen if the european harmonised rate of inflation is to be adopted , it seems likely that the published rate of inflation will reduce .
since , most pay rises are linked in some way to inflation , it seems to be a sensible conclusion that pay packets wo n't grow as quickly , which will also mean lower than forecast tax revenues .
this may result in a need to increase taxation - so the future seems to be lower pay and higher taxation , does n't it ?
phil hughes , selby no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible ron , uk the economy faces a good many challenges but gordon brown is the best chancellor we 've had in decades .
at least he can think beyond the next election , unlike his tory predecessors .
no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible .
ron , uk why not means-test child benefit and restrict it to those who need it i.e. those on below-average wages ?
why should middle-class people who choose to have children be subsidised by other tax payers ?
glyn perrens , christchurch i work in manufacturing and the support the government has offered is a disgrace .
talk is cheap it 's time real action was taken to save some of the tens of thousands of jobs that have been lost .
andrew , glasgow , uk brilliant !
so because my wife has taken the courageous decision to give up her promising career to care for our young baby at home , rather than leave her in " registered childcare " , we do n't qualify for any of his extra tax relief and will continue to struggle to pay the mortgage whilst our taxes continue to climb .
gareth , newbury £ 37 billion borrowed , and most of it wasted .
three issues could have halved the costs .
1 .
let 's have a national debate about what care should be free on the nhs .
2 .
when two million people march to say no to a war , why should they pay the £ 6 billion for it ? 3 .
the combined issues affecting the elderly need addressing .
a cross party system incorporating enforced ring-fencing of money for care and pensions in old age is essential to rebuild the public 's trust in pensions .
haydn latham , stafford so gordon brown was £ 10 billion out on his forecast .
is it just me or does that sound like a big chunk of change ?
will that 10bn eventually translate to tax rises ?
mark j , birmingham he could have made his speech much shorter .
" tax , borrow and spend " - that about sums it all up .
david howe , chelmsford nothing mr brown announces ever helps the average working woman or man andrea , london the government is continuing to treat the electorate as a cash cow .
nothing mr brown announces ever helps the average working woman or man .
it is all geared toward taking from the workers to give to the lazy .
andrea , london despite gordon brown 's confidence , i just ca n't shake off the feeling that the government is slowly losing its grip on the nation 's finances , having to pedal ever more furiously to prevent the economy from being carried completely away from all the chancellor 's targets - such as the level of borrowing , which strikes me as increasingly frightening paul , london , uk the service sector is propping up the uk economy - and is starting to be outsourced to india and china .
action needs to be taken to stimulate the rest of the economy before it 's too late for uk plc .
paul , swindon , uk i am concerned about the change in measuring inflation from rpi to the harmonised eu index .
if this is a lower figure , then pension providers should not be allowed to reduce inflation proofing payments .
these are currently based on rpi .
peter child , rugby why not some kind of tax incentive to manufacturing ?
i believe that one of the reasons for our current financial predicament is that britain started to move away from supporting our manufacturing base to the service industry .
now that service industry , especially it and the financial services are in trouble and call centres are moving abroad we are purely relying on the loans that consumers take to prop the economy up .
carl , london i would like the chancellor to help out first time buyers luke , grays , uk i would like the chancellor to help out first time buyers .
my partner and i both work full-time and are still unable to get even a flat in our area .
perhaps by relieving stamp duty for first-time buyers under £ 150k would help us .
luke , grays , uk i am not a high earner , but an ever increasing proportion of my salary in lost in taxes , both direct and indirect .
it has got to the point where getting into debt is the only way for me to fund , for example , college for my son .
and where has all this tax money gone ?
it has been poured down the drain into a sewer of bureaucratic over-regulation , welfare benefits for the feckless and worsening public services .
enough is enough .
david , england reading your contributors comments it is clear that a vast majority expect to pay less tax but at the same time demand more and better services to be provided - you ca n't have both .
it may be an old mantra but you can not expect 20 years of underinvestment by a conservative government to be sorted out in 6 years !
stop complaining and thank your lucky stars that you live in a country where a long term illness does not result in bankruptcy as it often does in that great capitalist icon the usa !
iain monaghan , brighton i would like to see a commitment to reduce both bureaucracy and taxation .
an acknowledgement by gordon brown that there is actually no such thing as " government money " , only taxpayers ' money .
david moran , scotland / australia i would like to see the chancellor tackle buy to let housing .
how many people now own more than one home ?
that 's stopping first time buyers more than a shortage of house building .
i live on a new estate , out of a row of 12 new houses 3 are to-let , that i know of .
multiply that statistic across the country and that 's where the problem lies .
richard fordham , england capital gains tax on individual housing profits would restore sense to housing market and help ' affordable ' housing .
jim ritson , great britain gordon needs to return to his socialist roots and introduce a 50 % -lrb- at least -rrb- top rate of tax for those earning over £ 80,000 .
also need pensions linked to average earnings once more , a ghost of thatcher that needs to be exorcised once and for all sam russell , canterbury , uk call me selfish but i earn my money and would like to see more of it for me to make decisions with marc , uk i have a good job and by many people am probably considered a good earner .
i pay my mortgage , save some , invest some and sometimes even shock horror spend some on myself .
what i am not expecting back from the budget is a " hey you work hard for your money , have a little more back after all you earned it " .
i have never really had anything from the government except my tuition fees paid .
i might earn well but like many good earners i worked my way up to this level and only now have begun to have even some money to myself .
call me selfish but i earn my money and would like to see more of it for me to make decisions with not for brown et al to throw around .
marc , uk the level of public spending is rapidly approaching 50 % of the nation 's income .
put another way , everyone employed in private enterprise is keeping himself and a public sector worker .
gordon , we ca n't afford that .
that 's why tax revenues are n't increasing at the rate you think you can decree .
the game is up !
neil , uk a fairer tax on self employed .
so many get away with paying so little compared with the paye employed richard davie , scotland i do n't need to bother with the budget because the bottom line is i 'll be a few quid worse off than before , the same as every other budget .
chris boyle , wales huge increases have gone into the nhs and education budgets , and the result has been longer nhs queues and inflated a-level grades .
so what do people want - why , more taxes .
when are the people who carry on about " proper funding " going to realise that improved services require improved management .
more funding without tighter management gets you absolutely nowhere .
jon livesey , usa does it really matter ?
every year it is the same no matter which party is in power .
the middle class is always the one to foot the bill of funding the country .
stephen , wales what does it mean for me ? - nothing - i got out in ' 97 when labour came to power when brown was preparing his tax and spend bonanza .
edwin , uk / romania when will people realise that ' fair ' taxation is not increasing the rates of higher earners .
it is the economics of spite duncan , uk to the financially illiterate amongst the contributors here - it is not just call centre jobs that can be taken offshore .
finance houses are not inextricably wedded to the uk , they can still run international finance from any country in the world .
so if you want the city ' fat cats ' to walk just keep up your proposals to increase taxes on higher earners and you will get umpteen percent of nothing .
when will people realise that ' fair ' taxation is not increasing the rates off higher earners .
it is the economics of spite and will take us back to the dark ages of the 70 's .
duncan , uk more tax is needed to pay for our illegal wars .
the tax budget ' books ' should be published fully on the internet so we can see where ' all ' the money we are robbed off goes .
only fully open-government equals democracy , anything else is a dictatorship .
colin harrison , england restore the pensions link with earnings and stop this stupid means tested benefits , and regulate income through the inland revenue , like working people dc waller , wales how about cutting the useless quangos at government , disposing of red tape and reforming local government .
then use the money saved to provide decent public services , and if there is any money left over , why not abolish tuition fees ?
john harding , lancaster , uk its pretty clear that the average person is living well above their means - encouraged by a government that will soon be forced to raise interest rates and taxes and leaves millions in a disastrous debt trap colin bond , england stop wasting money on so called outreach co-ordinators and pen pushers and paperclip movers and spend it where it is most needed i.e. nurses , doctors etc .
stop giving money to pensioners with one hand and taking more away with the other , for instance council tax .
and sort out john prescott , he 's been a disaster in every department he 's been in .
j penney , england tax simplification seems well-supported here .
how about taking the ultimate step - just 2 taxes ; income and vat .
scrap the rest - all of them .
adjust tax levels to compensate for all the others .
just think of the stupendous cost saving of no more employment tax -lrb- ni -rrb- , 2nd income tax -lrb- employees ni -rrb- , fuel tax , alcohol tax , council tax , house buying tax -lrb- stamp duty -rrb- , tax tax -lrb- e.g. vat on fuel tax -rrb- , insurance tax , health-premium tax -lrb- for gods sake -rrb- and all the other taxes whose processing sucks the life out of tax payers .

please sir can i have some more ? ! !
graham , uk i earn £ 5000 more then i did in 2000 yet i end up £ 30 a month worse off before council tax is included !

karen , uk as someone about to have a second child and facing childcare bills of over £ 1000 a month , how about making all childcare tax deductible ?
after all , it 's a business expense - i only incur the cost because i work and hence only continue to be a taxpayer because i shell out for childcare .
please take note mr brown !
karen , uk it seems that the chancellor is keen to try to sell us the idea of fixed rate mortgages .
whilst the rational behind this seems sensible , it smacks a little of closing the stable door once the horse has bolted .
who in their right mind would take out a fixed rate mortgage on today 's astronomical house prices , where low interest rates have already priced themselves into the -lrb- exorbitantly high -rrb- value ?
martin , uk tax incentives to encourage personal responsibility for health .
throwing ever more money into the nhs is doing nothing for the nation 's health .
sa , uk who in their right mind is going to pay £ 600 a month for a 100k fixed rate mortgage over 25 years when they can pay as little as £ 250 for the same loan on a shorter variable rate .
this is yet another example of how the government wants to interfere with people 's lives .
c. beaven , uk when oh when , will gordon brown do something for the many who have worked all their lives and who have to look after a loved one ?
the carers get a very bad deal from this labour government .
pete , uk i just wish they 'd drop the red tape .
tell us how much tax you need - we have no choice but to pay it .
i 'd also like to see a receipt indicating how it 's really been spent .
russ , uk let 's see the whole system simplified brendan maclean , birmingham , uk income tax should be set at a level that allows us to actually fund the services we pay for .
council tax and national insurance should be abolished and the shortfall added to income tax .
let 's see the whole system simplified .
tax cuts have no value if the result is service cuts .
brendan maclean , birmingham , uk i 'd like to lower taxes which would be paid for by the disbanding of the multitude of quangos that soak up so much public money and give so little in return .
paul , uk cutbacks .
cut bureaucracy , cut quangos , cut government sponsored junkets , cut luxury limousines , cut ministerial entertainment budgets and luncheons , and finally , cut tax , with all the money we 've saved !
rob holman , chislehurst , kent , england let 's get rid of the road fund licence and put the tax on petrol .

why should a pensioner pay the same to use their car once a week , as the rep hammering up and down the motorway everyday ?
it does n't make sense .
terry watson , uk how about merging the current 36 nhs regulators into 1 , cut all the red-tape associated with target-meeting paperwork and pump the funds into the front-line rather than the bureaucrats ' offices .
i would like to see business taxes cut to encourage entrepreneurship and higher tax breaks for r & d nearer the 10 % in europe up from the uk 's 3.5 % .
how about merging national insurance with income tax to further reduce administration costs ?
just a thought gordon !
harry , uk blocking tax loopholes that are exploited by the wealthy john c , bath , england an end to rip off pfis , national insurance thresholds scrapped , funds raised by way of one-off tax on higher earners to re-nationalise public transport , tax grab on companies exporting jobs to the third world , blocking tax loopholes that are exploited by the wealthy , and a hint that blair will finally resign .
john c , bath , england i propose increased tax - for anyone who complains about taxation !
neil , uk some tax relief for savers would be a good idea .
the government want us to save more but does little to encourage us .
it 's hardly surprising that a lot of people take the view that you might as well spend it while you have it .
al , uk provide tax incentives for the development of brownfield sites for housing to encourage further sustainable housing development .
at the same time levy tax on the use of greenfield sites .
jw , uk tax incentives to commuters who use public transport al , uk i would like to see the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings , tax incentives to commuters who use public transport -lrb- rather than just milking the motorist who may not have a choice about how he commutes -rrb- , and some tax penalties to companies who employ off-shore staff , such as call centres al , uk just where has all the extra tax money taken from us for improved public services gone ?
i ca n't honestly think of any public service that i have encountered where there has been an improvement in the last 5 years .
kev , uk it wo n't happen but there are to things that i would like to hear him say .
the first is that he will stop raiding all the pension funds for his £ 5bn per annum as this currently means that " ordinary " workers are penalised for prudent saving .
the second thing would be say that joining the euro is a non-starter whilst the french and germans keep breaking the rules that they themselves initiated .
richard , uk i 'd like to see incentive rewarded .
i work hard to make a little go a long way , and i wish the government would stop bashing me down .
they treat me like a high earner because the tax bands have n't moved with the cost of living .
annie , uk money to keep old peoples homes open and proper funding for those who have paid their dues and now deserve decent treatment in old age .
jim rose , england how about a simplification in the absurdly complex taxation system ?
this will be cheaper to administer so for once those of us who pay five figures in direct tax each year can get a reduction instead of paying more and receiving less .
we could also see a restructuring of public services since it is now abundantly clear that simply throwing more money into the bottomless pit is achieving nothing other than even less value for money .
john b , uk what would be nice is a lower rate of interest on mortgages and lower stamp duty rates for first time buyers .
also , as the lib dems propose , taking an extra tax off those earning over £ 100,000 per year , e.g. £ 5 .
just this small deduction would raise something like £ 30b and then that money could be distributed to needy areas , e.g. health , security and education .

the chancellor delivered an upbeat view of the economy but admitted that the uk will have to borrow £ 10bn more than originally predicated in april .
he also revealed that the measure of inflation would be switched from the retail price index to the harmonised consumer price index which is used by the eu .
mr brown also announced a series of measures aimed at widening childcare provision and bringing more young people out of poverty .
what did you think of the chancellor 's pre-budget report ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : i know the uk economy is buoyant , i know the chancellor is borrowing significant sums to balance the books ...
what i do n't know is where the money is going .
paul , belgium -lrb- expat -rrb- it sounds to me like an election gimmick j b lear , witham it sounds to me like an election gimmick .
all about child care and nothing about pensioners , their poverty and the poor state of care homes .
today 's papers predict an increase of over 8 % in council tax next year .
j b lear , witham there is no viable option for our country other than to support gordon brown 's spending programme .
this government has at least stopped the rot and begun to clear up the devastation of four terms of the tories .
does anyone really think that the country could take another bout of that ?
robert crosby , nottingham , uk when people praise redistribution so highly , let it be remembered that a lot of what the low paid get back is money taken from them in income tax and national insurance in the first place because the starting point for tax and nic is so low .
brian w , chelmsford , uk with reference to mr brown 's increase in borrowing by a further 10 billion , resulting in an approximate deficit of £ 47 billion .
please justify how a man who is in financial control of the countries biggest company i.e. great briton uk plc has still got a job at all ?
any other person would have been dismissed billions of pounds ago !
martin spencer , telford what a lot of mean-spirited and selfish people there are out there .
the corollary of their argument is that many children would be living in poverty and misery - as they were in the 1980s .
gordon brown is a redistributive chancellor , giving us the best economy in europe and dishing out some of the proceeds to prevent hardship .
the tory alternative may mean lower taxes - for those lucky enough to have a job .
many jobs have been gained under gordon brown 's policies - one of them could be yours .
think about that before complaining .
andrew , burnley , uk there is far to much waste on so-called management consultants and sundry spivs .
taxes are already too high , but at least he is going to do something with the lunatic " planning " system that has made housing unaffordable in the uk - preferably take an axe to it !
the barker report that accompanied the statement was a breath of fresh air !
mark , hitchin , uk i know of people who will be entitled to more child tax credits and they will be used as spending money on their next annual holiday !
susan , uk i 'm annoyed that people without kids seem to think they are the only ones paying tax !
my husband and i have two children and we will not be better off under the new proposals , however i know of people who will be entitled to more child tax credits and they will be used as spending money on their next annual holiday !
this does need to be addressed at the next budget .
susan , uk if i had to ask for a loan that mr brown will be asking for , i 'd be having sleepless nights .
sleep well gordon !
mh , hinckley great , so now childcare is going to cost me more than it does already .
mr brown is pricing people like me out of the uk job market .
fortunately , i can always emigrate and thus earn more and have a lower cost of living .
its getting to the stage where the majority of graduates will be better off abroad than here - surely this is crazy !
sarah , cambridge the economy faces a good many challenges but gordon brown is the best chancellor we 've had in decades .
at least he can think beyond the next election , unlike his tory predecessors .
no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible .
ron , uk if i 'd been that far out on my budget estimate , i 'd have been fired .
scott , uk those in glass houses should not throw stones peter , plymouth ironic really is n't it .
in the same week as mr brown expresses criticism about the mounting burden of debt on families , he is quite happy to burden the tax payer with ever increasing levels of public debt .
so , who is more prudent ?
is it joe public who borrows to buy a better house or a new car ?
or is it a chancellor who borrows to fund increasingly bureaucratic and wasteful government departments .
those in glass houses should not throw stones .
peter , plymouth why give tax credits to families earning upwards of £ 50,000 a year to look after their children !
do n't pensioners struggling by on £ 71.50 a week deserve recognition for their efforts in building up this country so that these young families have the benefit of their hard graft through the 30s , 40s and 50s ?
come on brown look after those who rebuilt this country after the war .
john , birmingham many of the responses on this page seem unbelievably selfish , along the lines of " what 's in it for me ? "
i take heart from a news headline published on the bbc website earlier today -lrb- and very quickly consigned to the archive -rrb- : " uk moving up poverty league " with experts noting " real progress " by the government .
credit where credit is due .
noel , london he should have scrapped child benefit .
if you choose to have a child , pay for it .
it is utterly immoral to expect anyone else to have to go out to work and pay for another 's choice to have children .
joe , uk joe , uk , misses the point about kids .
you need to encourage people to have kids otherwise there will be no-one around to prop up your pension scheme .
i know you pay your own way and you save for the future , but please bear in mind that without customers and workers in 30 years time the company that has promised to pay you a pension will be gone .
rick hough , knutsford , cheshire £ 10 billion more than planned ?
unacceptable .
even a banana republic like south africa does better than that .
perhaps mr brown should go for lessons with trevor manuel -lrb- the south african minister of finance -rrb- to learn how to spend frugally .
disgraceful !
stefan , london let me see , i work my way up from being a student , get taxed more to help public services ?
pay for my own pension , have private health care yet even though i use less i am expected to pay more , we are paying through our noses for a war we did n't want , and paying for asylum for umpteen thousands of people , why do n't we all just become unemployed , have kids and get more money .
why should those who have worked blooming hard to earn a great wage be penalised for it ?
jo , aberdeen if you want good public services you have to pay for them gwilym , london good grief !
what a bunch of moaning , mean spirited people the british are !
the simple fact is if you want good public services you have to pay for them .
if you want european levels of public transport , health service , social services etc. you have to pay european levels of tax -lrb- which are on average are a lot higher than here -rrb- .
i agree that there are definite savings that can be made by better management but in the end you get what you pay for .
i do n't agree with many things the government has done but the increase in finance for the public sector is a welcome change from the penny pinching of previous governments .
gwilym , london once again , we are being asked to subsidise other people 's lifestyle .
having children is a matter of choice , not right .
i am not expected to pay for your car , satellite television or holiday in florida - why expect me to pay for your children ?
philip , southend-on-sea my mate 's father died at home today , because there was no hospice place for him .
around the corner , an elderly lady , living in sheltered accommodation was murdered last week .
now gordon , you show me how your taxing has benefited my community ?
ian , birkenhead allowing couples with children to file tax returns together so that single income families can benefit from both tax-free allowances .
it is hard enough to raise children on two incomes and is becoming impossible on a single income which reduces each year as more tax is taken from it .
david , frinton simplification of the tax system is would save huge amounts of cash .
combine everything into income tax - it is after all the fairest tax we have - the greater your ability to pay - the more you pay - simple !
lee , stevenage why why why do i always come out of a budget worse off ?
karl , northants , uk why why why do i always come out of a budget worse off ?
i do n't smoke , i 'm reasonably fit , i own my own home and car and have two children .
mr brown , what the hell are you wasting my money on ?
stop giving it away to those who refuse to work for a start , and get rid of middle management in money eating monsters such as the nhs .
karl , northants , uk i like to think i am a compassionate and charitable person .
however , like karl , i am tired of my husband and i having to work hard to maintain a standard of living that others on a lot less income -lrb- and therefore a lot less responsibility at work -rrb- are maintaining with tax credits and other forms of supplementary income from the state .
i have three children and have financially shot myself in the foot by getting an education and a decent job .
new labour has done little for the middle income households - these are not the previous ' middle classes ' , they are hardworking individuals who have sufficient drive and determination to not want to be supported by the state .
lesley-anne , uk there would be no need for any further tax rises if this wretched government stopped wasting our money and stopped paying people to do nothing .
philip cleveland , uk perhaps if the £ 6bn or so the chancellor and the government have so far on a fruitless war , then perhaps we might have seen more value for our money , i.e. better services etc .
this government is just full of spin .
say one thing , do another , and then shamelessly at the end of the day do what you promised you would n't do / or would n't happen .
john , aberdeen if the european harmonised rate of inflation is to be adopted , it seems likely that the published rate of inflation will reduce .
since , most pay rises are linked in some way to inflation , it seems to be a sensible conclusion that pay packets wo n't grow as quickly , which will also mean lower than forecast tax revenues .
this may result in a need to increase taxation - so the future seems to be lower pay and higher taxation , does n't it ?
phil hughes , selby no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible ron , uk the economy faces a good many challenges but gordon brown is the best chancellor we 've had in decades .
at least he can think beyond the next election , unlike his tory predecessors .
no room whatsoever for complacency but i believe he 's striking the best balance possible .
ron , uk why not means-test child benefit and restrict it to those who need it i.e. those on below-average wages ?
why should middle-class people who choose to have children be subsidised by other tax payers ?
glyn perrens , christchurch i work in manufacturing and the support the government has offered is a disgrace .
talk is cheap it 's time real action was taken to save some of the tens of thousands of jobs that have been lost .
andrew , glasgow , uk brilliant !
so because my wife has taken the courageous decision to give up her promising career to care for our young baby at home , rather than leave her in " registered childcare " , we do n't qualify for any of his extra tax relief and will continue to struggle to pay the mortgage whilst our taxes continue to climb .
gareth , newbury £ 37 billion borrowed , and most of it wasted .
three issues could have halved the costs .
1 .
let 's have a national debate about what care should be free on the nhs .
2 .
when two million people march to say no to a war , why should they pay the £ 6 billion for it ? 3 .
the combined issues affecting the elderly need addressing .
a cross party system incorporating enforced ring-fencing of money for care and pensions in old age is essential to rebuild the public 's trust in pensions .
haydn latham , stafford so gordon brown was £ 10 billion out on his forecast .
is it just me or does that sound like a big chunk of change ?
will that 10bn eventually translate to tax rises ?
mark j , birmingham he could have made his speech much shorter .
" tax , borrow and spend " - that about sums it all up .
david howe , chelmsford nothing mr brown announces ever helps the average working woman or man andrea , london the government is continuing to treat the electorate as a cash cow .
nothing mr brown announces ever helps the average working woman or man .
it is all geared toward taking from the workers to give to the lazy .
andrea , london despite gordon brown 's confidence , i just ca n't shake off the feeling that the government is slowly losing its grip on the nation 's finances , having to pedal ever more furiously to prevent the economy from being carried completely away from all the chancellor 's targets - such as the level of borrowing , which strikes me as increasingly frightening paul , london , uk the service sector is propping up the uk economy - and is starting to be outsourced to india and china .
action needs to be taken to stimulate the rest of the economy before it 's too late for uk plc .
paul , swindon , uk i am concerned about the change in measuring inflation from rpi to the harmonised eu index .
if this is a lower figure , then pension providers should not be allowed to reduce inflation proofing payments .
these are currently based on rpi .
peter child , rugby why not some kind of tax incentive to manufacturing ?
i believe that one of the reasons for our current financial predicament is that britain started to move away from supporting our manufacturing base to the service industry .
now that service industry , especially it and the financial services are in trouble and call centres are moving abroad we are purely relying on the loans that consumers take to prop the economy up .
carl , london i would like the chancellor to help out first time buyers luke , grays , uk i would like the chancellor to help out first time buyers .
my partner and i both work full-time and are still unable to get even a flat in our area .
perhaps by relieving stamp duty for first-time buyers under £ 150k would help us .
luke , grays , uk i am not a high earner , but an ever increasing proportion of my salary in lost in taxes , both direct and indirect .
it has got to the point where getting into debt is the only way for me to fund , for example , college for my son .
and where has all this tax money gone ?
it has been poured down the drain into a sewer of bureaucratic over-regulation , welfare benefits for the feckless and worsening public services .
enough is enough .
david , england reading your contributors comments it is clear that a vast majority expect to pay less tax but at the same time demand more and better services to be provided - you ca n't have both .
it may be an old mantra but you can not expect 20 years of underinvestment by a conservative government to be sorted out in 6 years !
stop complaining and thank your lucky stars that you live in a country where a long term illness does not result in bankruptcy as it often does in that great capitalist icon the usa !
iain monaghan , brighton i would like to see a commitment to reduce both bureaucracy and taxation .
an acknowledgement by gordon brown that there is actually no such thing as " government money " , only taxpayers ' money .
david moran , scotland / australia i would like to see the chancellor tackle buy to let housing .
how many people now own more than one home ?
that 's stopping first time buyers more than a shortage of house building .
i live on a new estate , out of a row of 12 new houses 3 are to-let , that i know of .
multiply that statistic across the country and that 's where the problem lies .
richard fordham , england capital gains tax on individual housing profits would restore sense to housing market and help ' affordable ' housing .
jim ritson , great britain gordon needs to return to his socialist roots and introduce a 50 % -lrb- at least -rrb- top rate of tax for those earning over £ 80,000 .
also need pensions linked to average earnings once more , a ghost of thatcher that needs to be exorcised once and for all sam russell , canterbury , uk call me selfish but i earn my money and would like to see more of it for me to make decisions with marc , uk i have a good job and by many people am probably considered a good earner .
i pay my mortgage , save some , invest some and sometimes even shock horror spend some on myself .
what i am not expecting back from the budget is a " hey you work hard for your money , have a little more back after all you earned it " .
i have never really had anything from the government except my tuition fees paid .
i might earn well but like many good earners i worked my way up to this level and only now have begun to have even some money to myself .
call me selfish but i earn my money and would like to see more of it for me to make decisions with not for brown et al to throw around .
marc , uk the level of public spending is rapidly approaching 50 % of the nation 's income .
put another way , everyone employed in private enterprise is keeping himself and a public sector worker .
gordon , we ca n't afford that .
that 's why tax revenues are n't increasing at the rate you think you can decree .
the game is up !
neil , uk a fairer tax on self employed .
so many get away with paying so little compared with the paye employed richard davie , scotland i do n't need to bother with the budget because the bottom line is i 'll be a few quid worse off than before , the same as every other budget .
chris boyle , wales huge increases have gone into the nhs and education budgets , and the result has been longer nhs queues and inflated a-level grades .
so what do people want - why , more taxes .
when are the people who carry on about " proper funding " going to realise that improved services require improved management .
more funding without tighter management gets you absolutely nowhere .
jon livesey , usa does it really matter ?
every year it is the same no matter which party is in power .
the middle class is always the one to foot the bill of funding the country .
stephen , wales what does it mean for me ? - nothing - i got out in ' 97 when labour came to power when brown was preparing his tax and spend bonanza .
edwin , uk / romania when will people realise that ' fair ' taxation is not increasing the rates of higher earners .
it is the economics of spite duncan , uk to the financially illiterate amongst the contributors here - it is not just call centre jobs that can be taken offshore .
finance houses are not inextricably wedded to the uk , they can still run international finance from any country in the world .
so if you want the city ' fat cats ' to walk just keep up your proposals to increase taxes on higher earners and you will get umpteen percent of nothing .
when will people realise that ' fair ' taxation is not increasing the rates off higher earners .
it is the economics of spite and will take us back to the dark ages of the 70 's .
duncan , uk more tax is needed to pay for our illegal wars .
the tax budget ' books ' should be published fully on the internet so we can see where ' all ' the money we are robbed off goes .
only fully open-government equals democracy , anything else is a dictatorship .
colin harrison , england restore the pensions link with earnings and stop this stupid means tested benefits , and regulate income through the inland revenue , like working people dc waller , wales how about cutting the useless quangos at government , disposing of red tape and reforming local government .
then use the money saved to provide decent public services , and if there is any money left over , why not abolish tuition fees ?
john harding , lancaster , uk its pretty clear that the average person is living well above their means - encouraged by a government that will soon be forced to raise interest rates and taxes and leaves millions in a disastrous debt trap colin bond , england stop wasting money on so called outreach co-ordinators and pen pushers and paperclip movers and spend it where it is most needed i.e. nurses , doctors etc .
stop giving money to pensioners with one hand and taking more away with the other , for instance council tax .
and sort out john prescott , he 's been a disaster in every department he 's been in .
j penney , england tax simplification seems well-supported here .
how about taking the ultimate step - just 2 taxes ; income and vat .
scrap the rest - all of them .
adjust tax levels to compensate for all the others .
just think of the stupendous cost saving of no more employment tax -lrb- ni -rrb- , 2nd income tax -lrb- employees ni -rrb- , fuel tax , alcohol tax , council tax , house buying tax -lrb- stamp duty -rrb- , tax tax -lrb- e.g. vat on fuel tax -rrb- , insurance tax , health-premium tax -lrb- for gods sake -rrb- and all the other taxes whose processing sucks the life out of tax payers .

please take note mr brown !
karen , uk it seems that the chancellor is keen to try to sell us the idea of fixed rate mortgages .
whilst the rational behind this seems sensible , it smacks a little of closing the stable door once the horse has bolted .
who in their right mind would take out a fixed rate mortgage on today 's astronomical house prices , where low interest rates have already priced themselves into the -lrb- exorbitantly high -rrb- value ?
martin , uk tax incentives to encourage personal responsibility for health .
throwing ever more money into the nhs is doing nothing for the nation 's health .
sa , uk who in their right mind is going to pay £ 600 a month for a 100k fixed rate mortgage over 25 years when they can pay as little as £ 250 for the same loan on a shorter variable rate .
this is yet another example of how the government wants to interfere with people 's lives .
c. beaven , uk when oh when , will gordon brown do something for the many who have worked all their lives and who have to look after a loved one ?
the carers get a very bad deal from this labour government .
pete , uk i just wish they 'd drop the red tape .

terry watson , uk how about merging the current 36 nhs regulators into 1 , cut all the red-tape associated with target-meeting paperwork and pump the funds into the front-line rather than the bureaucrats ' offices .
i would like to see business taxes cut to encourage entrepreneurship and higher tax breaks for r & d nearer the 10 % in europe up from the uk 's 3.5 % .

jw , uk tax incentives to commuters who use public transport al , uk i would like to see the restoration of the link between pensions and earnings , tax incentives to commuters who use public transport -lrb- rather than just milking the motorist who may not have a choice about how he commutes -rrb- , and some tax penalties to companies who employ off-shore staff , such as call centres al , uk just where has all the extra tax money taken from us for improved public services gone ?

kev , uk it wo n't happen but there are to things that i would like to hear him say .
the first is that he will stop raiding all the pension funds for his £ 5bn per annum as this currently means that " ordinary " workers are penalised for prudent saving .
the second thing would be say that joining the euro is a non-starter whilst the french and germans keep breaking the rules that they themselves initiated .

jim rose , england how about a simplification in the absurdly complex taxation system ?
this will be cheaper to administer so for once those of us who pay five figures in direct tax each year can get a reduction instead of paying more and receiving less .
we could also see a restructuring of public services since it is now abundantly clear that simply throwing more money into the bottomless pit is achieving nothing other than even less value for money .

also , as the lib dems propose , taking an extra tax off those earning over £ 100,000 per year , e.g. £ 5 .

the uk group has scrapped two-year rolling contracts for executive directors , which had sparked anger from investors over so-called " fat cat " pay .

the move comes after shareholders voted against a multi-million pay and rewards package for bosses earlier in the year .
clear policy the unprecedented revolt was highlighted by a controversial " golden parachute " pay deal for chief executive jean-pierre garnier , which caused heated debate at the company 's annual general meeting in may .
gsk said it had held talks with major shareholders , the association of british insurers and the national association of pension funds before arranging its revised pay arrangements .
chairman sir christopher hogg said : " the new policy is clear and unambiguous and will be operated consistently . "
he added : " no other pharmaceutical company has adopted such demanding performance criteria . "
salaries review the national association of pension funds said it welcomed gsk 's decision , describing the move to reduce executive contracts as " good news " .
the group said it also backed gsk 's review of salaries , which could see mr garnier earn up to $ 10m -lrb- £ 5.7m -rrb- .
a spokesman said : " we understand that there is a global market out there and so you may have to pay global prices to get the best , but it has to be linked to performance . "

the net is now seen as a global resource for the first time , politicians , business representatives and development workers sat down at a global forum to wrestle with a subject few know much about and many fear .
at the world summit on the information society , organised by the un , some 170 countries endorsed what has been called the first constitution for the information age .
the documents reflect the growing awareness of leaders of the political , economic and social impact of the internet and other communication technologies .

yorkshire water had planned to demolish the former dam-keeper 's cottage they were living in during the £ 7m project at linley wood reservoir in north yorkshire .
the plans were altered after engineers found the pipistrelle and brown long-eared bats in the building 's roof .
now the company has completed work to raise the level of three dams at the site in the washburn valley , the mammals will be left in peace .
bats are a protected species in britain , though the pipistrelle and brown long-eared variety are not under threat .
yorkshire water applied for a bat licence in summer 2002 to allow them to temporarily disturb the bats as they carried out the work .
the ground floor of the cottage was filled in through a small window during the project , keeping the bats ' base in the roof intact above the water level .
the pipistrelle is britain 's smallest - and most common - bat and can catch up to 300 insects a night .
