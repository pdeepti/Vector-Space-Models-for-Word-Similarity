however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .
but additionally , firms will have to give their products a “ use-by ” date , indicating to consumers how long they can use a product before it becomes dangerous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .
künast also warned dumping could increase the temptation for farmers to engage in illegal agricultural practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has long been a critic of agricultural mass production .
as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .
but price wars at discounters - which are accused of cutting prices below the actual cost of production - are making it more difficult for organic farmers , whose products are more expensive to produce , to compete .
stricter laws in the works chancellor schröder ' government is planning a set of new laws aimed at curbing price dumping practices .
the rules would be anchored in a reformed law on unfair competition practices as well as a planned law lifting many restrictions that currently inhibit competition .
the justice ministry says a draft of the new legislation will be ready by the end of january .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farm the minister is not alone in her campaign against rock-bottom prices .
gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers association , also warned against the " magic of cheap , " stating that price dumping could lead to cuts in jobs and also harm german farmers .
" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .
" minister künast is full of hot air , " said hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr .
" price dumping is already illegal .
and the quality of products sold by discounters is already absolutely fine .

pellengahr also noted that the food scandals that have rocked europe in recent years were not the product of discount chains .

with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .

on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .

with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .

large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.01.2003 europe fingerprints against fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a process every future refugee will have to go through europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations . a europe-wide fingerprinting system aimed at controlling asylum-seekers could be a dangerous first step in a further erosion of civil rights , human rights organizations said wednesday . the 3.7 million euro eurodac system , which goes into effect wednesday , creates a central computer database which will crunch the fingerprints of every person at least 14-years-old who is seeking asylum in one of the 15 eu countries , save denmark .
the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.01.2003 drawing on energy in a " passive " way großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the passive building cuts energy and costs the world 's largest office building that makes use of solar energy and the earth 's heat to warm it and does away with conventional heating facilities , has been built in ulm , germany . if an office building usually conjures up images of artificially- heated or air-conditioned rooms where the air is stale and the light harsh , it 's time to take a look at an architectural innovation that 's changing the image of the sterile workplace . called a " passive " building on account of its drawing on natural energy sources to maintain an optimal temperature , the biggest office complex of its kind in the world has now been built in ulm , southern germany . named " energon " , the five-storey building with working space for about 420 employees , is energy-efficient and self-reliant ; warming and cooling itself automatically . energon was commissioned by the non-profit german software corporation foundation .
the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .
künast also warned dumping could increase the temptation for farmers to engage in illegal agricultural practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has long been a critic of agricultural mass production .
as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .
but price wars at discounters - which are accused of cutting prices below the actual cost of production - are making it more difficult for organic farmers , whose products are more expensive to produce , to compete .
stricter laws in the works chancellor schröder ' government is planning a set of new laws aimed at curbing price dumping practices .
the rules would be anchored in a reformed law on unfair competition practices as well as a planned law lifting many restrictions that currently inhibit competition .
the justice ministry says a draft of the new legislation will be ready by the end of january .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farm the minister is not alone in her campaign against rock-bottom prices .
gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers association , also warned against the " magic of cheap , " stating that price dumping could lead to cuts in jobs and also harm german farmers .
" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .
" minister künast is full of hot air , " said hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr .
" price dumping is already illegal .
and the quality of products sold by discounters is already absolutely fine .
stiftung warentest confirms this month after month , " he said , referring to germany 's equivalent to " consumer reports . "
pellengahr also noted that the food scandals that have rocked europe in recent years were not the product of discount chains .
" there is no connection between low prices and bse or nitrofen , " he said .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- offered a similar position .
" low prices are n't automatically dumping , " dihk department director august ortmeyer told the associated press .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.01.2003 eu plans ban on animal testing for cosmetics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing " cruel beauty " goodbye the european parliament has passed a law banning the sale and production of products tested on animals .
observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .
but additionally , firms will have to give their products a “ use-by ” date , indicating to consumers how long they can use a product before it becomes dangerous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .
we need a solution that ’ s fair and effective . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu observer european union news at a glance 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .
" two weeks long everything went fine , " software foundation real estate manager lars borghaus told dw-world .
at the end of the third week though , energon had to revert to the power plant to warm the incoming air .
the fact that only one-quarter of the building is occupied so far means though that energon is n't able to function to its full potential since bodily warmth too contributes to a toasty room . borghaus says that the building has generated a lot of interest .

with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .
but additionally , firms will have to give their products a “ use-by ” date , indicating to consumers how long they can use a product before it becomes dangerous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .
künast also warned dumping could increase the temptation for farmers to engage in illegal agricultural practices .

as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .
but price wars at discounters - which are accused of cutting prices below the actual cost of production - are making it more difficult for organic farmers , whose products are more expensive to produce , to compete .
stricter laws in the works chancellor schröder ' government is planning a set of new laws aimed at curbing price dumping practices .
the rules would be anchored in a reformed law on unfair competition practices as well as a planned law lifting many restrictions that currently inhibit competition .
the justice ministry says a draft of the new legislation will be ready by the end of january .

" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .

with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.01.2003 muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mecca cola motto : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment " mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .
with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .
but additionally , firms will have to give their products a “ use-by ” date , indicating to consumers how long they can use a product before it becomes dangerous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .
" two weeks long everything went fine , " software foundation real estate manager lars borghaus told dw-world .
at the end of the third week though , energon had to revert to the power plant to warm the incoming air .
the fact that only one-quarter of the building is occupied so far means though that energon is n't able to function to its full potential since bodily warmth too contributes to a toasty room . borghaus says that the building has generated a lot of interest .

observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .
künast also warned dumping could increase the temptation for farmers to engage in illegal agricultural practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has long been a critic of agricultural mass production .
as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .
but price wars at discounters - which are accused of cutting prices below the actual cost of production - are making it more difficult for organic farmers , whose products are more expensive to produce , to compete .
stricter laws in the works chancellor schröder ' government is planning a set of new laws aimed at curbing price dumping practices .
the rules would be anchored in a reformed law on unfair competition practices as well as a planned law lifting many restrictions that currently inhibit competition .
the justice ministry says a draft of the new legislation will be ready by the end of january .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farm the minister is not alone in her campaign against rock-bottom prices .
gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers association , also warned against the " magic of cheap , " stating that price dumping could lead to cuts in jobs and also harm german farmers .
" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .
" minister künast is full of hot air , " said hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr .
" price dumping is already illegal .
and the quality of products sold by discounters is already absolutely fine .
stiftung warentest confirms this month after month , " he said , referring to germany 's equivalent to " consumer reports . "
pellengahr also noted that the food scandals that have rocked europe in recent years were not the product of discount chains .
" there is no connection between low prices and bse or nitrofen , " he said .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- offered a similar position .
" low prices are n't automatically dumping , " dihk department director august ortmeyer told the associated press .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .

as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .

" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .

observers believe it will soon be approved in brussels too . the european union on wednesday passed a new law outlawing the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals , regardless of whether or not they have been produced in the eu . starting in 2009 , the majority of the tests conducted on animals to ensure the safety of cosmetic products - ranging from deodorant to hand cream and lip sticks - will be outlawed , with companies forced to use the alternative methods . for those remaining tests where no alternative has been developed yet , companies will be given a grace period until 2013 . the new law cements a compromise reached by eu member states in the european council last november .
however , because the european parliament has no binding legislative powers , the law now requires formal approval by the council of ministers . fears for u.s. trade parliament passed the law despite fears the move would put trade at risk between the eu and countries that continue to produce cosmetic products still tested on animals .
however , eu commissioner erikki liikanen assured the parliament the new law would not pose a problem . “ the solution found offers a genuine benefit for animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments , ” liikanen said at a session of parliament on wednesday . but the cosmetics industry is unconvinced .
“ we don ’ t know what the reaction of the americans and japanese will be , ” anita colman of colipa , the european cosmetic toiletry and perfumery association , told reuters . “ a step in the right direction ” but animal rights campaigners - who say 38,000 animals die needlessly in cosmetic testing each year - were pleased by the news , although they remained critical about the delay before the new law can come fully into force . “ it ’ s a small step in the right direction , although the phase out -lrb- of testing on animals -rrb- till 2009 is ridiculously long , given all the effective alternative that exist right now , " sean gifford , director of campaigns for the european chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals , told dw-world . " we have safe , effective and reliable non-animal tests that over 600 cosmetic companies around the world already use .
companies like avon and estée lauder already test using cell cultures , tissue cultures , corneas from eye banks and even human clinical studies , ” he said . the new directive also bans substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic in the production of cosmetic and forces cosmetics firms to label products more comprehensively . in future , if your mascara or lipstick contains any substance which could induce an allergic reaction , it will be on the label .
but additionally , firms will have to give their products a “ use-by ” date , indicating to consumers how long they can use a product before it becomes dangerous . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .
we need a solution that ’ s fair and effective . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu observer european union news at a glance 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with most germans squarely against george w. bush 's policies against iraq , it could prove a hit here . dagmar lohmann started her career as an actress .
then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the industry says its prices are merely competitive . a leading minister in the german government has said she will launch a campaign against price dumping allegedly being practiced by leading discount supermarket chains like aldi , plus and lidl , which have an enormous impact on german farmers .
renate künast of the green party , who serves as minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , said earlier this week she would seek to pass new laws that would ban price wars that lead to price dumping that , ultimately , is harmful to retailers , farmers and consumers alike .
" i ca n't and wo n't impose on consumers , " künast told reporters on wednesday , " but the fact is - and this is the truth - that quality and safety have their price . "
and " when we say we do n't want farmers to use antibiotics or growth hormones , that 's also going to cost a few cents more , " she said .
künast also warned dumping could increase the temptation for farmers to engage in illegal agricultural practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast künast -lrb- photo -rrb- has long been a critic of agricultural mass production .
as a central tenet of her term , she announced a year ago , she wants to see the market share of organic products increase from the current level of 2.5 percent to 20 percent .
but price wars at discounters - which are accused of cutting prices below the actual cost of production - are making it more difficult for organic farmers , whose products are more expensive to produce , to compete .
stricter laws in the works chancellor schröder ' government is planning a set of new laws aimed at curbing price dumping practices .
the rules would be anchored in a reformed law on unfair competition practices as well as a planned law lifting many restrictions that currently inhibit competition .
the justice ministry says a draft of the new legislation will be ready by the end of january .

gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers association , also warned against the " magic of cheap , " stating that price dumping could lead to cuts in jobs and also harm german farmers .
" the first to lose out will be farmers , but grocery stores and consumers will lose out in the end , too . "
" low prices are n't automatically dumping " künast 's offense against discount chains drew immediate criticism from the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- and some quarters in the government 's opposition .
" minister künast is full of hot air , " said hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr .
" price dumping is already illegal .

" there is no connection between low prices and bse or nitrofen , " he said .
the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- offered a similar position .

then she became a mother .
approaching 40 when she returned to the working world , she abandoned the stage and instead became one of the biggest distributors of absinthe in germany - a drink long associated with vice and decadence that became legal again a few years ago after nearly a century of prohibition .
now in a classic sinner-to-saint conversion , lohmann is about to become the german distributor of mecca cola , a beverage that is socially acceptable for europe 's muslims and has taken france by storm .
lohmann is hoping to repeat that success in germany .
" there 's a huge market for mecca cola in germany , " lohmann told dw-world .
" coca cola has become a symbol of american politics , and i can imagine there are a lot of people out there who would like to try something else .
people who buy this drink are making a political statement - and , of course , it is influenced by america 's iraq policies . " 81 percent against iraq war lohmann is predicting strong sales in germany .
her firm , lohmann spirits , is n't just setting its eyes on turkish-run corner shops or places like hamburg , berlin and the ruhr region which have a strong muslim population , either .
she believes the product will find broad resonance in a country where 81 percent of the population feels a u.s.-led war against saddam hussein is currently unjustified .
and she may have a point there .
in france , mecca cola has become a cult object - especially in small muslim-run stores , where most bottles are sold .
since introducing mecca cola in november , its french-tunisian creator , radio journalist tawfik mathlouthi , claims he has sold more than 2.2 million 1.5 liter bottles in france , germany and great britain .
the drink 's red and white label , which appears to be a direct play off coca cola , calls on consumers to : " do n't drink like an idiot anymore , drink with commitment . "
in france , mathlouthi has politicized the drink by donating 20 percent of all profits to charity and political causes , including palestinian groups .
on the company 's official web site , mathlouthi includes pictures of intifada fighters armed only with stones as they face off against israeli troops with live ammunition and tanks .
economics serving ideology and politics " i had the idea to launch this new engaged beverage , " he told deutsche welle in november .
" it 's a new concept - it 's economics serving ideology and politics .
we want to help arabs and muslims to stop consuming american products and to have their own ones because our own purpose is to fight american policies -lrb- especially in the middle east -rrb- and their blind support of the zionist entity . "
the success of coke alternatives like zamzam cola , which is produced in iran and distributed in many arab states including saudia arabia , inspired mathlouthi to bring the trend to europe .
more than 12 million of the european union 's 375 million residents are of muslim faith .
close to five million live in france and 3.2 million in germany .
berlin entrepreneur lohmann , though german herself , converted to islam five years ago .
she says she had grown disenchanted with the protestant church , which she felt no longer offered the spiritual richness she was seeking .
many of her friends in germany are muslims and she felt they led lives with greater meaning and happiness and decided to become a member of the religion .
she says she will continue the company 's charitable traditions , which have courted controversy in germany .
she says 10 percent of proceeds will go to support projects to school palestinian children living in refugee camps and an additional 10 percent to european charities .
the cola for open minds ?
but lohmann cautions that she is n't just marketing the drink to muslims in germany - or any other niche for that matter .
" we 're not orienting our project toward any group , " she says .
" it 's for christians , muslims , the old and the young .
anyone who wants to buy our drink is welcome - we just want to make our product available to anyone who has an open mind . "
and asked whether she fears she will be pigeon-holed as a " fundamentalist , " by aligning herself with the product , she shrugs it off .
" they used to call me the ' absinthe lady . '
i think people will have the opposite reaction .
people are asking more questions and probing deeper in the muslim religion these days and maybe the media will do that , too . "
nor does she see any contradiction in operating a company that will simultaneously be selling a drink that through its very name shuns western culture , and an alcoholic beverage that is banned in the city the cola drink is named after .
" it 's not a contradiction , " she says .
" mecca cola was founded in france .
it 's not a muslim drink .
i just felt the need to sell it .
i mean , by selling absinthe , i helped break taboos . "
a distribution dispute lohmann hopes to get her product onto the shelves of berlin grocery stores by mid-february , but some nagging issues need to be resolved before that .
first , mecca cola requires government approval before it can be sold in germany .
and there 's a second problem : though lohmann says she has obtained a preliminary contract from mathlouthi to distribute mecca cola , a 27-year-old syrian in hamburg , mahmoud hinnaui is also claiming to be germany 's exclusive distributor .
until the dispute is resolved in paris , consumers in germany may have to wait a bit before they can partake in this anti-globalization soft drink protest .
ironically , the delay could be good for the berlin entrepreneur .
" if it comes to a war in iraq , i think a lot of people will switch to mecca cola , " she predicts . daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .
" two weeks long everything went fine , " software foundation real estate manager lars borghaus told dw-world .
at the end of the third week though , energon had to revert to the power plant to warm the incoming air .
the fact that only one-quarter of the building is occupied so far means though that energon is n't able to function to its full potential since bodily warmth too contributes to a toasty room . borghaus says that the building has generated a lot of interest .

the foundation 's chairman peter schnell wanted to build an office building that employed passive house principles . the german ministry of economics and technology supported the project , and the scientific fraunhofer institute is monitoring the development .
energon is meant to be both an investment and an innovation , according to pamela vendt , a spokesperson for the foundation that supports other non-profits to realize projects meant to benefit society . passive house technology a passive house maintains an optimum temperature without active heating and cooling systems .
no mechanical means are employed to regulate temperature , rather the building " passively " does the work itself .
passive buildings are designed to be extremely well-insulated and to optimally take advantage of the suns rays .
southern orientation is carefully considered in situating the building , as well as the use of shade . at € 12.7 million -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- , building costs for energon were comparable to that of a standard office building of the same size .
the software foundation reckons that running costs will be cheaper than those of a conventional office building , with savings amounting to € 30,000 per year .
the building also produces 175 tons less carbon dioxide than a normal office building while it provides 7,000 square meters -lrb- 75,350 square feet -rrb- of space for 420 working places in the science park ii office complex in ulm .
construction was completed in late october 2002 . efficiency essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passivhaus energon in ulm architects stefan oehler and barbara faigle won the open competition for the construction of a passive building initiated by the german software corporation foundation .
their design was a triangular construction with curved facades .
large glass facades , long the fashion in architecture , were out of the question , because they let in or out too much heat .
in the building 's interior , offices have windows opening on a large glass-roofed atrium , which is central to energon 's temperature regulation.a transparent sun shield automatically covers the glass roof when the sun blazes down to prevent the offices from getting too hot . energon regulates temperature by sucking in air from the building 's exterior through underground canals , which it then warms or cools with the help of 40 vertical probes extending 100 meters into the ground .
at that depth , the surface temperature no longer influences the air temperature , so that the earth 's natural temperature of 12 – 14 c cools or heats the air , which then can be further adjusted by a heat exchanging device before it is sucked into the building .
the air then circulates into the offices through the atrium and through canals leading from the atrium through the ceilings of the five stories . additionally , warm or cold water circulates through pipes in the ceilings for further temperature regulation . solar panels on the building 's roof provide around 6 percent of energon 's energy needs .
in winter , heat gained from spent air can be reused and , if all else fails , air can be warmed from a distant power plant . put to the test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oehler + arch kom architekten ingenieure tel + 49 07252 - 95 76 26 melanchthon 10 info @ archkom.de fax + 49 07252 - 95 76 27 d 75015 bretten www.archkom.de energon 's ability to deal with cold was put to the test over the last three weeks , when freezing temperatures enveloped germany .
" two weeks long everything went fine , " software foundation real estate manager lars borghaus told dw-world .
at the end of the third week though , energon had to revert to the power plant to warm the incoming air .
the fact that only one-quarter of the building is occupied so far means though that energon is n't able to function to its full potential since bodily warmth too contributes to a toasty room . borghaus says that the building has generated a lot of interest .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .

the eu commission says the system , which will also be used in non-eu countries norway and iceland , is guaranteed to prevent refugees from applying in more than one country . each refugee will be fingerprinted the moment he or she passes through eu borders .
whatever country they land in will be the country in which they apply for asylum . the commission maintains that 10-20 percent of the round 400,000 applicants each year apply in more than one country .
the practice improves the chances of finding a home somewhere in europe , but adds confusion and costs to an already cumbersome process in many countries . the new system would deter such “ asylum shopping , ” uk home affairs minister beverley hughes said recently . taking steps in the wrong order europe , destination to hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants from developing nations around the world , has been struggling to find a common line on the touchy subject since the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .
countries such as the uk and germany , who have led the eu in asylum applications for the past few years , see themselves as the chief victims of “ asylum shopping . ” by fingerprinting every applicant the moment they enter an eu country , the burden will most likely shift to southern countries like italy , greece and spain , on whose shores the majority of refugees arrive . human rights organizations have been quick to criticize the new system .
proasyl , a german asylum-rights organization , says the eu is introducing a europe-wide computer system before the region passes a unified policy on asylum-seekers . “ they ’ ve taken a second , erroneous step before they ’ ve taken the first step , ” said karl kopp , proasyl ’ s european director . slipping down a slope more troubling to kopp is the potential slippery slope the eu is embarking on .
kopp says it won ’ t be long before law enforcement gain access to such a database , which would amount to a egregious violation of civil rights .
german interior minister otto schily has already called for such access , said kopp . the commission , seeking to assuage such fears , said that the only data collected would be the biometric fingerprint and that only selected immigration officials in each country will have access .
the statement has n't pacified rights groups . “ we want a system that it ’ s integral and provides protection for asylum seekers , ” said kopp , who noted that many refugees apply for asylum in countries where they have some familial , cultural or religious connection , not where they have the best shot at being accepted . “ we don ’ t need a technocratic , expensive solution .
we need a solution that ’ s fair and effective . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the eu observer european union news at a glance 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

it has placed an order for up to 50 boeing 737 aircraft at a total potential cost of $ 3.1bn.
the airline says it has requested 10 jets to be delivered by 2004 and may buy 40 more within 10 years .
the purchases will help the company " seize new domestic and international growth opportunities " , said virgin blue chief executive brett godfrey .
the airline is planning to move beyond the realms of domestic carrier and serve cities across the asia-pacific , including singapore , shanghai , tokyo and bali .
investor opportunities created three years ago , virgin blue is currently competing with australia 's national airline qantas for a share of the domestic market .
it has gained increased access to sydney airport following a six-month dispute with the airport owners .
the newcomer has seized 15 % of domestic market share and is aiming to capture a third of the market this year .
it is the first time that virgin blue has bought rather than leased aircraft .
us manufacturer boeing beat europe 's airbus in supplying the aircraft after 10 months of negotiations .
sir richard has announced plans for a $ 1.5bn flotation of virgin blue on the australian stock exchange this year .
he sold half of his airline to australia 's patrick corp in march last year , gaining a new injection of capital .

firstly , being in debt is not something to be ashamed of .
inevitably , some of us will get into difficulties , typically due to a change in circumstances such as a relationship breakdown , unemployment or illness .
contact your creditors , tell them you are having difficulties and let them know credit becomes debt when you ca n't meet the contractual payments without further borrowing .
realising this can be a shock , some people panic or try to ignore the problem - this is not a good idea as they can end up in the courts or worse .
first steps admitting there is a problem and that you need help is an important first step .
steve 's five rules do n't ignore the problem define income and expenditure deal with priority creditors first do not pay for debt advice courts can help , not hinder read a q & a about dealing with debt before embarking on your debt action plan contact your creditors , tell them you are having difficulties and let them know why .
confirm how much you owe and that you will be back in touch once you have worked out what you can afford to pay .
let things drift and you are likely to default and be blacklisted for future credit .
consolidation risk many people 's first instinct is to take on more debt .
the credit industry calls this a consolidation loan .
make sure you deal with your priority creditors first - those which could lead to you losing your home , liberty or fuel supply think carefully before doing this .
can you really afford the new repayments ?
it may make things worse rather than better .
most consolidation loan firms will seek to secure such loans on your home , which could put it at risk .
financial statement before making any move to tackle your debt , you need to get an accurate picture of your income and outgoings .
compile a weekly or monthly personal financial statement .
and if your outgoings exceed your income : check you are getting all the benefits you are entitled to - all reputable money advice agencies will do this -lrb- you should not have to pay for this advice -rrb- review expenditure - see if you can cut down , but avoid doing this to basics like food , gas and electricity - and remember you need enough to live on , not just to survive on send your creditors a copy of your financial statement , making it clear what you can afford to pay them .
sort your priorities make sure you deal with your priority creditors first - those which could lead to you losing your home , liberty or fuel supply .
do not ignore bills or court letters once you have dealt with your priority creditors , write to all your other creditors .
distribute any available money fairly - make the offers relative to the size of the debt .
be realistic .
remember you may have to maintain these payments for some time .
smaller but regular payments are preferable to unrealistic offers , which you can not sustain .
nothing to offer ?
whilst you should aim to make offers of payment , this may not always be possible .
if no money is available but positive change is expected , such as a new job , ask if you can freeze your account for three or six months .
if the money you have available is small , offer token payments to each of your creditors , even £ 1 or £ 2 a month can sometimes be acceptable .
creditors recognise some people will never be able to repay their debt and make provision for ' bad debt ' .
some debts are written off , although creditors are reluctant to do so .
court action debt can end in court action .
remember court is not there to punish debtors - it is an arbiter , a referee .
even if you have a county court judgment made against you and your debts are under £ 5,000 , you can request an administration order .

firstly , being in debt is not something to be ashamed of .
inevitably , some of us will get into difficulties , typically due to a change in circumstances such as a relationship breakdown , unemployment or illness . "
contact your creditors , tell them you are having difficulties and let them know " credit becomes debt when you ca n't meet the contractual payments without further borrowing .
realising this can be a shock , some people panic or try to ignore the problem - this is not a good idea as they can end up in the courts or worse .
first steps admitting there is a problem and that you need help is an important first step .
steve 's five rules do n't ignore the problem define income and expenditure deal with priority creditors first do not pay for debt advice courts can help , not hinder before embarking on your debt action plan contact your creditors , tell them you are having difficulties and let them know why .
confirm how much you owe and that you will be back in touch once you have worked out what you can afford to pay .
let things drift and you are likely to default and be blacklisted for future credit .
consolidation risk many people 's first instinct is to take on more debt .
the credit industry calls this a consolidation loan . "
make sure you deal with your priority creditors first - those which could lead to you losing your home , liberty or fuel supply " think carefully before doing this .
can you really afford the new repayments ?
it may make things worse rather than better .
most consolidation loan firms will seek to secure such loans on your home , which could put it at risk .
financial statement before making any move to tackle your debt , you need to get an accurate picture of your income and outgoings .
compile a weekly or monthly personal financial statement .
and if your outgoings exceed your income : check you are getting all the benefits you are entitled to - all reputable money advice agencies will do this -lrb- you should not have to pay for this advice -rrb- review expenditure - see if you can cut down , but avoid doing this to basics like food , gas and electricity - and remember you need enough to live on , not just to survive on send your creditors a copy of your financial statement , making it clear what you can afford to pay them .
sort your priorities make sure you deal with your priority creditors first - those which could lead to you losing your home , liberty or fuel supply .
once you have dealt with your priority creditors , write to all your other creditors .
distribute any available money fairly - make the offers relative to the size of the debt .
be realistic .
remember you may have to maintain these payments for some time .
smaller but regular payments are preferable to unrealistic offers , which you can not sustain .
nothing to offer ?
whilst you should aim to make offers of payment , this may not always be possible .
if no money is available but positive change is expected , such as a new job , ask if you can freeze your account for three or six months .
if the money you have available is small , offer token payments to each of your creditors , even £ 1 or £ 2 a month can sometimes be acceptable .
creditors recognise some people will never be able to repay their debt and make provision for ' bad debt ' .
some debts are written off , although creditors are reluctant to do so .
court action debt can end in court action .
remember court is not there to punish debtors - it is an arbiter , a referee .
even if you have a county court judgment made against you and your debts are under £ 5,000 , you can request an administration order .
under such an order the court will work out what you can afford to pay and then administer your debts for you .
unfortunately , you may find yourself dealing with debt collection agencies but they have no more power than creditors .
remember they will almost always need to take court action before being able to carry out any of their threats .
above all else when dealing with debt , stay in control .
even if circumstances deteriorate , review your financial statements and if necessary amend offers to creditors .

the three trusts are grampian university hospitals , lanarkshire acute hospitals and argyll and clyde acute hospitals trusts .
an audit scotland report revealed the trusts ran up the deficits totalling £ 13.2m in the financial year 2001/02 .
it said the picture would have been even worse if the executive had not provided £ 90m extra funding .
this is no way to run the nhs nicola sturgeon snp health spokeswoman audit scotland also warned that the grampian and argyll and clyde trusts , as well as the lothian university hospitals trust , may fail to meet their financial targets for 2002/03 .
scotland 's auditor general robert black said : " while the 2001/02 financial situation of most trusts improved over the previous year , this is at least partly thanks to the additional £ 90m which the executive provided .
" without that additional funding , simply based on figures in the accounts , another 12 trusts would have found it difficult to break even during 2001/02 . "
mr black also warned that the additional £ 2.7bn being ploughed into the nhs in scotland over the next three years may not help many trusts balance their books .
" underlying financial pressures remain and need to be addressed , " he said .
health minister malcolm chisholm welcomed the report and said the additional cash being invested in the nhs would lead to significant improvements .
patient care he added : " i expect nhs boards to manage the financial position across the board area .
" frontline patient care is paramount and any adjustments in priorities , should these be required to remain within budget , must not impact on patient care . "
but the scottish national party said the figures showed that trusts are living a hand to mouth existence .
health spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " this is no way to run the nhs in scotland - it is short-termism and does not improve patient care in the long run .
" but above all it begs the question if labour really is investing in the nhs , why are so many trusts on the edge of deficit ? "
