in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .
the text wo n't be finalized until after an intergovernmental conference convenes in october with officials from each of the current 15 eu member states and the 10 accession countries .
then it must be ratified by each country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god 's place in europe 's future constitution a draft of the constitution that is to put the aims and goals of the european union on paper , has run into heavy criticism from the pope because of the absence of any mention of god in the document 's preamble .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .

" i have my doubts ... whether increasing the number of soldiers currently there , regardless of who they are provided by , would mean a definite improvement in security , " schröder told the german parliament during a debate on the 2004 draft budget .
" i believe that those people - in the united states too - are right who say what we really need is training for iraqi police and training for the iraqi military , " he said .
the chancellor , who antagonized washington with his strident opposition to the iraq war , said germany was willing to train iraqi forces and police , but ruled out sending troops , saying extra soldiers should preferably come from muslim countries .
schröder also alluded to germany ’ s overstretched army , which already has peacekeepers deployed in the balkans and afghanistan . more briefs 10.09.2003 -pipe- lufthansa cancels u.s. flights on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.09.2003 a tale of two cities on the german-polish border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt and slubice : regulations keep them apart while frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- seems to lack appeal to germans , people in neighboring slubice , on the polish side of the river , may jump at the chance to live in one of the thousands of vacant apartments in the border town . hardly anyone moves to the other frankfurt . since the berlin wall fell in 1989 , eastern germany 's cities and towns have been continually losing inhabitants .
more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "
frankfurt plans to demolish at least 7,000 of the apartments over the next few years . michael brückner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

but even as the countdown to enlargement , planned for 2004 , begins , a number of hurdles remain .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .

somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution .

conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .
the text wo n't be finalized until after an intergovernmental conference convenes in october with officials from each of the current 15 eu member states and the 10 accession countries .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .
critics accuse the wto of exploiting countries in the third world through the globalization of the world economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moots lowering -lrb- some -rrb- trade barriers as crucial wto talks on trade liberalization get underway in mexico next week , the eu has stressed that reaching agreement on dismantling trade barriers is its top priority .
but critics remain skeptical .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .
the text wo n't be finalized until after an intergovernmental conference convenes in october with officials from each of the current 15 eu member states and the 10 accession countries .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .

since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .

the case was eventually dropped .

though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .
critics accuse the wto of exploiting countries in the third world through the globalization of the world economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moots lowering -lrb- some -rrb- trade barriers as crucial wto talks on trade liberalization get underway in mexico next week , the eu has stressed that reaching agreement on dismantling trade barriers is its top priority .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "
frankfurt plans to demolish at least 7,000 of the apartments over the next few years . michael brückner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .
" through my optimism i naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .

poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .
critics accuse the wto of exploiting countries in the third world through the globalization of the world economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moots lowering -lrb- some -rrb- trade barriers as crucial wto talks on trade liberalization get underway in mexico next week , the eu has stressed that reaching agreement on dismantling trade barriers is its top priority .
but critics remain skeptical .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "
frankfurt plans to demolish at least 7,000 of the apartments over the next few years . michael brückner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past .

" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks .

if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2003 controversial filmmaker leni riefenstahl dead at 101 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl at age 100 german filmmaker and photographer leni riefenstahl - highly controversial for her propaganda films on the nazi regime - died monday , one week after her 101st birthday . germany ’ s seemingly invincible filmmaker and photographer , who donned scuba gear even on her 100th birthday to snap shots of sharks in turquoise waters , succumbed to a prolonged illness at her home in southern germany on monday night .
she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .
" through my optimism i naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "
frankfurt plans to demolish at least 7,000 of the apartments over the next few years . michael brückner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .
the text wo n't be finalized until after an intergovernmental conference convenes in october with officials from each of the current 15 eu member states and the 10 accession countries .
then it must be ratified by each country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god 's place in europe 's future constitution a draft of the constitution that is to put the aims and goals of the european union on paper , has run into heavy criticism from the pope because of the absence of any mention of god in the document 's preamble .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .
" through my optimism i naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization .

it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .
critics accuse the wto of exploiting countries in the third world through the globalization of the world economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moots lowering -lrb- some -rrb- trade barriers as crucial wto talks on trade liberalization get underway in mexico next week , the eu has stressed that reaching agreement on dismantling trade barriers is its top priority .
but critics remain skeptical .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .

somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .

transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .

wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .
the text wo n't be finalized until after an intergovernmental conference convenes in october with officials from each of the current 15 eu member states and the 10 accession countries .
then it must be ratified by each country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de god 's place in europe 's future constitution a draft of the constitution that is to put the aims and goals of the european union on paper , has run into heavy criticism from the pope because of the absence of any mention of god in the document 's preamble .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .
until germany ceded the region to poland after world war ii , slubice was the frankfurt suburb dammvorstadt .
nowadays economic development on the german side is practically stagnating , while the polish side is beginning to prosper - both economically and in size . borders will be borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but most poles can forget about finding a home in frankfurt 's prefab ghost town neighborhoods anytime in the near future , and mayor patzelt has n't been able to keep his word . it will be years before people can live in the west and work in the east or vice versa . nor will that change when poland joins the european union on may 1 , 2004 .
transitional measures will prevent germans from taking advantage of low prices in poland to buy property and poles from working in germany and undercutting the local labor market with lower wage demands for up to seven years after accession . but as the clock ticks toward integration , frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- officials have found a workaround : the city has been granted permission by the state of brandenburg to grant polish apartment seekers residence permits , though there are some strings attached . applicants must meet several prerequisites before they may covet the city thousands of people have abandoned .
they must have a regular income and be prepared to pay rent that is nearly three times as expensive as in poland .
they also have to relinquish all rights to german social welfare benefits . and that could make the deal a lot less attractive for poles , who earned an average of $ 9,500 -lrb- € 8,500 -rrb- last year as opposed to $ 26,600 in germany . heinz-dieter walter is aware too that not many poles are likely to be able to fulfill the criteria .
but , he says , " we do n't just want to fill up our apartments .
we want a normal neighborhood . " but even when the first poles , residence permits in hand , start hunting for apartments , they should n't have their hearts set on moving into a gdr-era prefab , known here as a " plattenbau . "

" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .
europe must redefine itself and its identity today in exchange with the other regions , in particular with africa , the middle east and north america . " europe : a work-in-progress the continent 's cultural and religious diversity has made the notion of europe as the christian occident an irreversible thing of the past .
for the moment europe is a sort of work-in-progress while the leaders search for ways to ensure peaceful coexistence . " to reflect the social realities of its people , -lsb- the eu -rsb- must be institutionally separate from the religious communities , " hungarian archbishop peter erdö explained in aachen .
" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .
i believe the recognition that religious tradition is essential to european identity is a decisive step -lsb- as is -rsb- the recognition of the independent role of religious communities in the constitution . " there 's still time to take account of the clerics opinions , though there 's no indication that will lead to changes in the draft .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.09.2003 pressure builds for deal at wto talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors have come to demonstrate against the wto trade talks .
wto talks on trade liberalization in mexico opened on wednesday amid anti-globalization protests and a simmering row between rich and poor countries over agricultural subsidies . the sweltering air at mexico ’ s caribbean resort of cancun was heavy with expectation as nearly 7000 delegates from 146 nations opened critical world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks on wednesday aimed at securing a deal on loosening barriers to global trade . on tuesday , wto director supachai panitchpakdi spelled out just how much is at stake a day before the crucial round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director supachai panitchpakdi " failure is not an option .
it would send a very damaging signal around the world about prospects for economic recovery and would result in more hardship for workers around the globe , particularly in poorer countries , " panitchpakdi told reuters . while the pressure will be intense on delegates to make progress on floundering trade negotiations started in the qatari capital of doha two years ago and forge a global trade deal by the end of next year , there will be plenty of hurdles to surmount . it 's all about the subsidies at the heart of the negotiation lie the thorny issues of agricultural subsidies that have split countries and pitted poor nations and farm goods-exporters against trading giants the european union and the united states . poor countries say both the eu and the u.s. must deliver on the promise made in doha and eliminate $ 300 billion in subsidies they hand out each year to their farmers – six times more than they provide in development aid .
poorer nations insist the handouts and tariffs distort trade by denying them access to rich-country markets and discriminating against their farmers at home through heavily subsidized imports from rich nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm goods-exporting camp , whose members range from rich states like australia and new zealand to poorer developing countries such as bolivia , as well as a larger group of 21 developing countries have indicated they will be putting aside their differences to air their grievances at cancun and push for the dismantling of all farm subsidies . " it is crunch time , " australian trade minister mark vaile told reuters .
" we have a choice of ... a better deal for efficient farmers around the world or we can stick with the injustices and the distortions of the past . " eu " ready to play ball " the eu , blamed for massive subsidies that result in surplus export goods , has signalled it is willing to do its part to secure a better deal for poor nations , but has refused to agree to the key demand of eliminating all subsidies . " the eu is ready to play ball , " european agriculture commissioner franz fischler said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- we can not take a general commitment that we can phase out subsidies on everything , " he added . fischler said in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung , " an opening of markets in the west would only profit strong agricultural exporters such as brazil , while africa would fall through the cracks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast german minister for agriculture and consumer affairs , renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said there should be increased consideration for the interests of the developing countries at cancun and the discussion shouldn ’ t just be limited to liberalization . " it ’ s important that one at least says that subsidies should be dismantled at a varying pace .
if we manage to agree on this principle , we can pursue a detailed debate in the next months about which products will be affected .
i ’ m sure that the poorest countries will bring up cotton and sugar , " she told deutsche welle before her departure to mexico .
the minister added that the goal of the wto summit should be to design a protective mechanism for the poorest countries , so that “ they can develop at all . ” the eu , for its part wants countries to agree to launch negotiations aimed at establishing new international regulations in four areas – investment , competition policy , customs facilitation and government procurement . u.s. upbeat about outcome the united states , which reached a framework agreement with the eu last month on farm reform despite other simmering trade rows , remains hopeful about the outcome of the latest wto round .
u.s. negotiators want developing countries to lower their own agricultural tariffs and the eu to agree to a formula that would harmonize the level of farm spending across the atlantic by requiring brussels to make deeper cuts . " many of us believe maybe the european union can move more and we ’ ve emphasized we ’ re willing to talk about very sizeable cuts if we get -lrb- more -rrb- market access , " u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said . demonstrations begin against trade round even as delegates scramble to reach a consensus amid jostling interests and goals over the next five days within a heavily-guarded convention center , they can count on large protests outside . thousands of anti-globalization activists , environmentalists and poor mexican farmers descended on cancun early this week with the first organized demonstration already held on the eve of the summit , eight kilometers away from the venue .
organizers expect further larger demonstrations in the coming week . about 3,500 security officials have been deployed to prevent a repeat of the wto ’ s seattle summit in 1999 , which was disrupted by violent demonstrations .
critics accuse the wto of exploiting countries in the third world through the globalization of the world economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moots lowering -lrb- some -rrb- trade barriers as crucial wto talks on trade liberalization get underway in mexico next week , the eu has stressed that reaching agreement on dismantling trade barriers is its top priority .
but critics remain skeptical .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

in a continent of christians , jews , muslims and people of other faiths , world religious leaders debate the future religious identity of europe at a conference in aachen . the issue of european values is anything but new .
tomes have been written about the values upon which europe was built , whether judeo-christian or purely humanistic .
the discussion was recently reignited by the european union draft constitution which says the union is founded on the values of " respect for human dignity , liberty , democracy … and respect for human rights . "
but the draft does not explicitly mention god or the region 's christian traditions . secular countries like france and spain fought against catholic-dominated poland to keep the language out , and so far they have prevailed .
the conflict illustrated the eu 's new ethical approach , and in particular that of a greater europe .
millions of orthodox christians and muslims belong to europe who are n't part of the occidental christian tradition .
this has led the eu to recognize that it must redefine its foundation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral under the auspices of the world peace prayer , held for the first time in germany , representatives from the world 's religions have been discussing political and religious issues under the theme " war and peace : faiths and cultures in dialogue " in aachen since sunday .
identity and values in europe 's future was the topic of one discussion at the annual ecumenical event that 's been organized by the rome-based organization community of sant 'egidio since 1987 . " we have long moved about in a eurocentric world view , where we observed the rest of the world from -lsb- our position here -rsb- in europe , " rev. konrad raiser , general-secretary of the world council of churches -lrb- wwc -rrb- , said .
" in the meantime we must recognize that europe is only one of the world 's large regions , that the times are past in which europe could practice cultural , political and scientific hegemony .

" but in many questions of moral values it can refer to these communities , work together with them or bear in mind the societal effect of their conscience-building activities . " but the difficult question - apparent in the debates over the constitution - has been how .
conservative christians like cologne 's catholic cardinal , joachim meisner , have said the humanistic values that have shaped europe are actually typical christian values and that the eu constitution must make mention of god . the russian orthodox church , personified in aachen by metropolitan kirill of the moscow patriarchy , insisted there was a dramatic contrast between the west 's liberalism and the religious culture of orthodox eastern europe .
but the difference is artificial since liberal humanism and being rooted in religious belief are not mutually exclusive ideas . wwc chief raiser represented a more moderate position .
he said he could accept the current eu constitution draft even without reference to god : " i think one can live with it , since a general , generic reference to god is too little for those who really believe in god and for the radical proponents of the separation of church and state it 's a big problem .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .

more and more apartments were vacated , particularly in the neighborhoods of prefabricated , concrete apartment blocks built since the 1960s .
before the end of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , 90,000 people lived in frankfurt an der oder .
now its size has shrunk by nearly a third , to a total of 67,000 inhabitants . the glut of empty quarters has caused frankfurt mayor martin patzelt to declare : " i would give anyone who comes an apartment . " those are bitter words on the polish side of the river , where an acute housing crisis reigns .
somewhere between 500 and 600 families are searching for new homes in slubice , according to the mayor 's spokesman , heinz-dieter walter .
" we have been engaged in joint city developmental policies and joint infrastructure planning with our polish neighbors for a long time already , " walter told deutsche welle . the german-polish border is lined with a number of twin cities , but görlitz-zgorzelec , guben-gubin and frankfurt-slubice are the largest .

she had just turned 101 .
riefenstahl , who was suffering from cancer , died in her sleep , companion horst kettner told bunte magazine .
" her heart simply stopped , " kettner said .
riefenstahl is reported to have undergone a series of operations in recent years including one for a fractured femur .
venturing into nazi territory born in 1902 in berlin , riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and in europe .
a knee injury forced her to stop and she then turned her attention to film and an acting career .
she went on to star in classics like the the white hell of pitz palu . riefenstahl ventured into filmmaking in the 1930s and it was her first feature film , the blue light , which attracted the attention of adolf hitler , then a rising political star .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her to create films about the nazi party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl during the shooting of " triumph of the will " her first work , triumph of the will -lrb- photo -rrb- , a hypnotic documentary about the 1934 nuremberg nazi party rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 .
triumph of will earned riefenstahl awards at the venice and paris film festivals in the 1930s .
riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made her works both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the nazi regime .
" nazi sympathizer " and " hitler 's girl " but after the war , critical questions were raised over riefenstahl ’ s collaboration with the nazis , as reflected in her works .
riefenstahl denied all conscious involvement with the regime and insisted she had not been a member of the national socialist party .
she claimed her film olympia glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to hound her as " nazi pin-up girl , " " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl . "
since the end of the war , riefenstahl won more than 50 libel suits relating to her involvement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
as late as 2002 , riefenstahl was investigated for holocaust denial after she said she did not know that gypsies taken from concentration camps to be used as extras in one of her wartime films later died in the camps .
the case was eventually dropped .
" i do n't know what i should apologize for " shunned by society and the media after the war , riefenstahl cultivated an interest in photography and scuba diving .
though she won critical acclaim for her later photographs of the african nuba people and of undersea flora and fauna , riefenstahl was unable to shake off the stigma of being a nazi sympathizer .
in an interview with the associated press just before her 100th birthday in 2002 , riefenstahl said she had " apologized for ever being born , " but that she should not be criticized for her skillful films .
" i don ’ t know what i should apologize for , " she said .
" i can not apologize for example , for having made the film triumph of the will – it won the top prize .
all my films won prizes . "
riefenstahl said the search for beauty dominated all her artistic quests .
" i always see more of the good and the beautiful than the ugly and the sick , " she said .
" through my optimism i naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life .

teller played a key role in us defence and energy policies for more than half a century , championing the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs .
he was also a strong advocate of nuclear power and the strategic defense initiative missile defence system , dubbed " star wars " .
teller suffered a stroke and died on tuesday in stanford , california , near the hoover institution where he served as a senior research fellow , a spokesman for lawrence livermore laboratory said .
teller 's long career saw him influence the policies of several us presidencies .
edward teller , 1908-2003 born in budapest , hungary , and studied physics at leipzig university , germany worked as physicist at los alamos scientific laboratory during world war ii taught physics at the university of california , helping found its livermore laboratory in the late 1950s controversial nuclear defender in 1939 , he was one of three scientists who encouraged albert einstein to alert president franklin d. roosevelt that the power of nuclear fission - the splitting of an atom 's nucleus - could be tapped to create a devastating new weapon .
in 1941 , before the first atom bomb had even been constructed , fellow scientist enrico fermi suggested that nuclear fusion - fusing rather than splitting nuclei - could be harnessed in an even more destructive device , the hydrogen bomb .
teller seized on the idea , and his pursuit of such a bomb won him the title " father of the h-bomb " , a term he reportedly hated .
the first megaton h-bomb was exploded in 1952 , though one has never been used in conflict .
teller received many honours in his long career , including the albert einstein award , the enrico fermi award and the national medal of science .

" to avoid compromising 25 % of -lrb- central bank -rrb- reserves , the government has decided to suspend the payment that was due today , " the cabinet chief 's office said in a statement .
the lack of agreement with the imf was the reason the default was necessary , the statement said .
argentina promised to keep working to sign off on a deal to pay just the interest on $ 12.5bn it owes the imf over the next three years , in order to focus its resources on social programmes .
but president nestor kirchner 's government has failed to agree to two demands from the imf - that banks must be compensated for last year 's collapse in the value of the peso , and that utility firms must be allowed to raise prices .
both these measures are highly unpopular domestically and perceived to be helping out big business at the expense of the poor .
little impact ?
argentina 's economic collapse at the end of 2001 led to a currency devaluation , the closure of banks , widespread poverty and rioting .
argentina has an internal debt that 's more important than its debt with the imf jorge ceballos , leader of the jobless demonstrators ' movement the country needs to find a solution to its imf debts before it can begin to restructure $ 90bn of debt it defaulted on in december 2001 .
observers worry a fresh default will damage investor 's confidence .
" the day to day will not change , but a default is serious because it means that argentina is refusing to deal with major economic issues that surged from last year 's collapse and could eventually undermine the recovery , " said sebastian rodrigo , a lawyer who advises local and foreign investors in argentina .
but some economists said a default would have little immediate impact on the argentine economy as it would take some time for any penalties to come into effect , and by then a new deal may have been reached .
imf under fire thousands of unemployed argentines demonstrated against the imf in buenos aires on tuesday .
" argentina has an internal debt that 's more important than its debt with the imf , " said jorge ceballos , a 43-year-old leader of the jobless demonstrators ' movement .
" instead of paying the imf , we should pay to improve our public health system , boost teachers ' salaries and end hunger in our devastated country , " he said .
the argentine government had received some backing on monday from the us - by far the most influential member of the imf - which called for flexibility .
" the us believes the conditions for reaching an agreement with the imf are favourable and that argentina enjoys terrific political support from the us and the g8 in general , " said us assistant secretary of state roger noriega .

" to avoid compromising 25 % of -lrb- central bank -rrb- reserves , the government has decided to suspend the payment that was due today , " the cabinet chief 's office said in a statement .
the lack of agreement with the imf was the reason the default was necessary , the statement said .
argentina promised to keep working to sign off on a deal to pay just the interest on $ 12.5bn it owes the imf over the next three years , in order to focus its resources on social programmes .
but president nestor kirchner 's government has failed to agree to two demands from the imf - that banks must be compensated for last year 's collapse in the value of the peso , and that utility firms must be allowed to raise prices .
both these measures are highly unpopular domestically and perceived to be helping out big business at the expense of the poor .

the deal , which as announced by a law firm representing some of the plaintiffs , is the largest known payout by a us diocese to settle molestation charges .
news of the agreement came after months of negotiations between church officials and lawyers for the plaintiffs - who say they were abused by clergy over the past six decades .
the plaintiffs have just over a month to decide whether to accept the offer .
under the deal , victims would receive awards ranging from $ 80,000 to $ 300,000 , according to a lawyer with the firm greenberg traurig , which represents about half of the plaintiffs .
the breakthrough comes more than two months after archbishop sean patrick o 'malley was installed as head of the fourth-largest roman catholic diocese in the us .
' time for healing ' one of the alleged victims , bernie mcdade , said he had pursued his case for the sake of " the children " .
it 's a good day for the archdiocese reverend christopher coyne archbishop 's spokesman " this has to stop , this has to stop for the children and we are today a step closer to that as being a reality , " he said .
mitchell garabedian , a victims ' lawyer , said it had ben a painful case for many and they were looking forward to " getting on with their lives " .
" i truly believe that we 've made progress with this settlement or this proposal today and i think it 's going to bring peace to many individuals , " he said .
a spokesman for archbishop o 'malley said it had been a " good day for the archdiocese " .
" we have n't had too many over the last couple of years , but this is one , " said the reverend christopher coyne .
crackdown bishop o 'malley 's predecessor , cardinal law , resigned amid public outrage in december following allegations he had moved paedophile priests from one pulpit to another rather than confront accusations that they had sexually assaulted children .
o 'malley pledged to crack down on sex abuse in the church the new archbishop gained national attention for cracking down on sex abuse in his previous assignments .
he said that the sums of money required to settle the abuse lawsuits were " staggering " but no amount could compensate for the damage caused by abuse .
attempts to find a settlement followed the temporary suspension of court action earlier this year by both sides in an effort to negotiate an agreement .
for the settlement to go into force , it has to be accepted by at least 95 % of the claimants .
last year , the church reached a $ 10m settlement with 86 victims of john geoghan , a boston-area priest whose criminal conviction for sexual abuse caused the scandal to come to light .

the public are being encouraged to give their views to staff , who will be available to answer questions .
councillor mike storey , liverpool city council leader , said : " this is a vital time for our world heritage site bid .
" it is important that as many people as possible find out about the bid and comment on the proposals to manage it . "
the draft management plan will also be available at public libraries throughout the city and in millennium house .
it is also available on the council 's website .
last week , an assessor from the international council on monuments and sites , ray bondin , toured the city 's key buildings and possessions .
they include the three graces - the liver , port of liverpool and cunard buildings - the albert docks , stanley docks warehouse and the central library 's rare books collection .

the teenager - who can not be identified because of his age - punched one male teacher and knocked the man 's female colleague unconscious in the playground of the school in cardiff .
the boy was sentenced on tuesday to four months detention and training after the attack on two teachers at the school .
he was described in court as a " serious danger to the public " after admitting actual bodily harm , assault and harassment .
speaking to bbc radio wales on wednesday , one of the teachers said he was still angry about the incident , but he was glad the teenager had been punished by the courts . "
it has made me appreciate some of the dangers of the profession " assaulted teacher " to be quite honest , i do still feel anger , and i do feel bitterness towards the boy for the injuries he caused to my colleague , " he said .
" i feel he was exploiting the system .
such behaviour tends to be targeted at teachers as some juveniles do recognise that the system protects them quite well . "
the court had heard that he had been permanently excluded from the school and had returned to see his friends .
the teacher told radio wales ' good morning wales that he had just finished teaching a lesson when he heard a disturbance involving two boys outside the classroom .
he recognised one as a pupil who had been permanently excluded six months earlier , and asked him to leave .
the boy grabbed the man 's name tag and screwed it up .
the teacher decided to follow him out of the school building in case there were problems , and was assaulted .

he had an evil look on his face and was ranting " female teacher who was attacked his colleague was knocked unconscious , and was so traumatised she has has had to undergo counselling since the incident .
despite the assault , the teacher said he had not been put off teaching , but he admitted : " it has made me appreciate some of the dangers of the profession , and how teachers can be quite vulnerable . "
he said he was glad the teenager had been given a spell of detention , but he added : " whether the sentence is strong enough to be a deterrent for him in the future , or for other juveniles in his position , i do n't know . "
during the juvenile court hearing , it was heard that the boy had been in trouble at school several times before the day of the attacks .
alex dubljvic , prosecuting , said : " he was a major problem causing major disruption at the school .
' locked classrooms ' " he was abusive to staff , was involved in fights with other pupils , was caught smoking , did not go to lessons and was making hoax calls . "
such was his reputation , the court was told , that on spotting the boy in school grounds , female members of staff were " so frightened that they locked the doors of classrooms " .
during the subsequent altercation , the teenager punched a male teacher and knocked a woman teacher unconscious with a single blow .
the female teacher told police the boy had clenched his fists " like a boxer " .
she said : " he had an evil look on his face and was ranting .
" i turned away to get help then felt a big thud to the side of my face .
" i felt my brain rattling around inside my head .
the next thing i remember is lying on the floor . "
the court heard how the teacher , who had been taken to hospital with a suspected broken jaw , had recovered but suffered flashbacks three months after the attack .
sentencing the boy , youth court chairman lenna pritchard-jones said : " we feel the offences are very serious because of the nature and extent of the harassment and violence towards the victims .
" you are a persistent offender and a serious danger to the public . "
his solicitor , geraint richards , said the boy was " well-balanced and well-mannered " until the death of his grandmother three years before when he began distancing himself from the rest of his family .
the boy 's parents were law-abiding people who were mystified by his behaviour , mr richards said .
on one occasion , the boy 's own father had reported him to the police .
he said the family was planning to make a fresh start and move out of the cardiff area .

the news that worcester city council has approved the plans has been greeted by flood campaigners as " fantastic " news .
residents of hylton road in the city , which runs along the western side of the severn and is a major arterial route , will benefit from the scheme which is expected to cost £ 100,000 .
many homeowners were left devastated after the floods of autumn and winter 2000 .
the three-way partnership between the city and county councils and the environment agency was approved by the full council on tuesday .
" just fantastic " more than 40 flood-hit residents applauded the council for recommending trials involving an experimental 300-metre pallet barrier system .
the decision was greeted by mary dhonau , representing the national flood forum and a local resident whose home has been flooded on several occasions , as " fantastic , just fantastic " .
the system uses a combination of steel frames , wooden pallets and reinforced plastic membrane to hold back flood waters .
it has already been used successfully on nine separate occasions in cologne in germany since 1999 and has also been awarded nine medals and awards throughout scandinavia and europe .
the system was also awarded kitemark recognition in the uk earlier this year .
the scheme will cost around £ 16,000 for manpower and policing for a 14-day flood defence and is cheaper and cleaner than using traditional sandbag techniques for holding back flood water .
