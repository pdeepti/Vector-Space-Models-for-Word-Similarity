pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .
following a string of terrorist attacks against western targets last year , the united states and most european countries issued advisories warning tourists and business travelers alike to avoid certain parts of aghanistan if not all of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

owing to the inflated price , sources at the ministry of defense have been quoted as saying the raf may slash its order to 150 planes . order prices almost double since inception with each aircraft costing almost € 98.7 million , germany can also expect a substantial bill for the 180 aircraft currently on order for the luftwaffe at a time when the ministry of defense is considering cuts .

greece , norway , austria and the netherlands have also shown interest in the fighter , despite its hefty price tag . if the critics are proved right and the years of delay have made the eurofighter obsolete before it even takes off , then it will be an expensive layout on what could be the european defense industry ’ s own white elephant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .
and we , as members of parliament , officials , and prominents are all called upon to grasp this current , and to give it a face , a voice and a sense of orientation . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky officially invited one time party leader and former berlin economics senator gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- to help the pds regain its status as an official party in the bundestag .

gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery .

pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .

the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .

by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .

gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”

she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 a new turn in german-pakistani relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani president pervez musharraf arrived in berlin for three days of talks on monday .
pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .
following a string of terrorist attacks against western targets last year , the united states and most european countries issued advisories warning tourists and business travelers alike to avoid certain parts of aghanistan if not all of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .

she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 back to the future for germany ’ s socialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky is voted back in as leader of the pds germany ’ s struggling socialist pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has elected a new leader .
the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .
and we , as members of parliament , officials , and prominents are all called upon to grasp this current , and to give it a face , a voice and a sense of orientation . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky officially invited one time party leader and former berlin economics senator gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- to help the pds regain its status as an official party in the bundestag .
gysi , who is perhaps germany ’ s best-known pds member , called on the party to start looking more outward than inward . speaking at the special session in berlin , he said the pds should spend less time dealing with internal affairs and focus instead on issues relevant to society .
gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .

the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .

a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .

pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .
following a string of terrorist attacks against western targets last year , the united states and most european countries issued advisories warning tourists and business travelers alike to avoid certain parts of aghanistan if not all of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .

the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .

the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 back to the future for germany ’ s socialists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky is voted back in as leader of the pds germany ’ s struggling socialist pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has elected a new leader .
the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .
and we , as members of parliament , officials , and prominents are all called upon to grasp this current , and to give it a face , a voice and a sense of orientation . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky officially invited one time party leader and former berlin economics senator gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- to help the pds regain its status as an official party in the bundestag .
gysi , who is perhaps germany ’ s best-known pds member , called on the party to start looking more outward than inward . speaking at the special session in berlin , he said the pds should spend less time dealing with internal affairs and focus instead on issues relevant to society .
gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .
with the tone set for a new start , the struggling party is looking ahead to the european elections , where it hopes to make enough of a mark to carry it forward to the next federal ballot in 2006 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german socialists lose leader in fight over orientation a power struggle inside the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has forced leader gabi zimmer to announce her resignation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery .

pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .
following a string of terrorist attacks against western targets last year , the united states and most european countries issued advisories warning tourists and business travelers alike to avoid certain parts of aghanistan if not all of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .

gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .

gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.06.2003 unicef germany turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unicef germany launched the campaign " stop small weapons " last year as conscripton of minors took on alarming proportions .
the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

the german chapter of the united nations children ’ s fund or unicef celebrates half a century of helping children in crisis worldwide as it turns 50 on monday .
deutsche welle looks back at a half-century of success . whether in sudan , afghanistan , ethiopia or nepal , the german arm of unicef has been bringing relief to millions of children in far-flung corners of the world ever since its inception .
the story began 50 years ago amid the ruins of world war ii when the united nations general assembly created an aid group in 1946 to explicitly help children in post-war europe .
unicef aid workers took up work in the devastated city of berlin and managed to distribute tons of cod liver oil capsules and milk powder to people in need .
by 1953 the small u.n. agency had provided some 2.5 million german children with antibiotics , clothes and milk .
once the most pressing postwar problems had been tackled , unicef became a permanent part of the u.n. system and on june 30 , 1953 , the german branch of the international organization was founded with its headquarters in cologne .
" unicef ’ s invaluable work in postwar germany has left behind a feeling of gratefulness .
that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery .

pakistan president gen. pervez musharraf arrived in berlin on monday for talks with both chancellor gerhard schröder and president johannes rau .
observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .

that ’ s why unicef germany was founded relatively early and has a fine tradition , which it ’ s based on , " unicef germany chairman reinhard schlagintweit told deutsche welle .
unicef germany in tune with the times from its focus on postwar europe , unicef turned to building development programs in asia , africa and latin america in the 50s and 60s and today helps children in more than 160 countries worldwide .
the emphasis is on providing children with medical care , primary education , access to clean drinking water as well as protecting them from abuse and exploitation .
in line with the growing internationalization of its parent organization ’ s profile , unicef germany has also expanded to 40 national committees and a team of 8,000 voluntary workers in more than 120 german cities .
the primary aim of the group is to support unicef ’ s activities mainly by raising funds .
unicef germany workers organize christmas bazaars , information events and sell the famous unicef greeting cards , created by international artists as well as children .
the organization has raised more than € 1.1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- over the last half century .
an important part of spreading the message is roping in celebrities , who can do much to help the cause with their support .
thus as with most unicef galas , the fiftieth anniversary celebrations in berlin will be a star-studded event .
german president johannes rau , popular television journalist sabine christiansen and former james bond actor roger moore will join other celebrities in berlin on monday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress katja riemann in senegal schlagintweit says attracting prominent personalities is hardly a difficult task .
" the wonderful thing is that unicef convinces through its work , so we actually don ’ t need to do much to win the support of actors , television personalities and politicians . "
a new focus for the past two decades , unicef has also been increasingly vocal on protecting children ’ s rights and has urged governments to do more to secure them . the declaration of the u.n. children ’ s right conventions in 1989 , that most countries except somalia and the u.s. have signed on to marked a milestone in the organization 's history .
" everywhere there are problems where children are treated unfairly , minorities are discriminated against , children are isolated or enough is not done for handicapped children .
that was a big step , " schlagintweit says .
child trade in europe a major concern the chairman of unicef germany also says that the battle against child exploitation , which includes child soldiers , indentured servants or sex slaves , has increasingly drawn unicef ’ s attention back to europe and germany .
though unicef germany is forbidden to develop aid programs in germany , because it is a wealthy country , schlagintweit says that does n't preclude his organization from being politically active in the country .
" for instance , we are for outlawing landmines in germany , and we ’ re also doing the same when it comes to small weapons - we want a stricter regulation that restricts the export , dealing and production of small weapons .
and we are also active in the area of foreign children in germany , who should not face social discrimination . "
but schlagintweit says one of the biggest problems facing the organization is trading in children , which is not only an international problem , but one that ’ s particularly acute in europe .
" it ’ s right in front of our doorsteps – in south eastern europe up to the german border and even within it .
the german government must do everything to ease this child misery . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down . with its current chairman unable to turn around an apparent leadership vacuum and dismal standings among voters , the party of democratic socialism elected a new chief over the weekend - the man who led the party throughout much of the 1990s . lothar bisky garnered some 78 percent of ballots at a special party conference held over the weekend .
but even with seven years experience at the party 's helm behind him , he has his work cut out for him . some nine months after its crushing failure in german national elections , the pds is floundering - not only feeling the rippling effects of the polling debacle , but also split down the middle by a tedious battle between traditionalists and reformers .
with only two directly elected members of parliament left in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , the pds has lost its official party status and is barely managing to scrape recognition as a national political force . now that he is officially back in the driving seat , 61-year-old bisky is determined to put an end to the in-fighting and to do as the party 's motto says : steer the pds " back to politics . " speaking at the meeting in berlin , he said germany desperately needed a socialist party that was prepared to fight for greater social justice and fight off social cuts .
his comments referred to the spd-green party coalition government ’ s planned changes to the labor market and health policy .
the pds is fundamentally opposed to the planned reforms , known collectively as " agenda 2010 , " which would reduce the length of time that the jobless can officially draw unemployment benefits and would lead to higher premium prices for members of the country 's public healthcare system . back to the party 's roots bisky believes that in order to escape its political quagmire and be taken seriously as an opponent to government policies such as ‘ agenda 2010 ’ , the pds has to return to its roots , which stem back to 1989/90 when the pds emerged out of the east german communist party , the sed . in a passionate plea to his party members , bisky said : “ the current of social democracy is merely trickling through our party .
and we , as members of parliament , officials , and prominents are all called upon to grasp this current , and to give it a face , a voice and a sense of orientation . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky officially invited one time party leader and former berlin economics senator gregor gysi -lrb- photo -rrb- to help the pds regain its status as an official party in the bundestag .
gysi , who is perhaps germany ’ s best-known pds member , called on the party to start looking more outward than inward . speaking at the special session in berlin , he said the pds should spend less time dealing with internal affairs and focus instead on issues relevant to society .
gysi also conceded that he had contributed to the current crisis , stating that after his resignation as berlin ’ s economics senator last summer , he and the party had “ grown apart a little . ”
he said the key now was to establish why the pds had lost its popularity , adding that the party wouldn ’ t stand a chance of survival until it had cemented its place in society . but it seems unlikely that gysi himself will play a defining role in that process as he has already told his long-time political companion , bisky , that he would not be making a return to office . outgoing party leader gabi zimmer , who is both bisky ’ s successor and predecessor , was open about her failure to pull the party together .
she said she had failed in her attempts to balance the scales between the " reformers , " who want active involvement in policy development , and the " traditionalists " who want the pds to be an uncompromising protest party . zimmer said the pds had no credible platform and , therefore , needed to establish a real strategy .
“ as far as i am concerned , the absence of such a strategic decision is the main reason for our multi-voice approach during the 2002 election campaign and for our lack of ability to deal with current conflicts with any clarity , ” zimmer said . looking ahead clarity is a staple in which bisky firmly believes , and he made no bones as he told his party that he would tolerate neither fundamental opposition or the spreading of left-wing sectarian tendencies , particularly in the tiny pds presence in the west .

observers hope the trip will help spur german investment in the country . topping the agenda for musharraf ’ s three-day visit are briefings on the fight against terrorism , the security situation in afghanistan and bilateral ties between germany and pakistan , which though generally " friendly " and " good , " as the german government has officially stated , have also stumbled into some rough patches . until the end of the cold war , relations between germany and pakistan were largely dominated by the interests of nato and the united states .
the two sides found more common ground during the late 1970s , when the soviets occupied afghanistan . but even after the soviets ' withdrawal from afghanistan and , later , the fall of the iron curtain , germany and pakistan continued to promote business and development ties .
between 1961 and 2000 , germany contributed close to € 2.5 billion in developmental aid to pakistan . but the relationship suffered a serious hiccup in 1998 , when pakistan conducted its first nuclear tests and germany reacted by eliminating development aid the following year .
the move caused the collapse of many existing bilateral economic projects and a significant reduction in the number of new projects approved by the german government .
relations remained somewhat strained until the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , after which point germany and pakistan began working closer together in the war against terrorism .
after a meeting between german and pakistani officials in bonn in december 2001 , aid was reinstated . renewed relations pakistan is also keen to benefit from the renewed western interest in the region , and the government in islamabad regularly consults european power centers like paris , london and berlin on issues of global concern like terrorism and drugs .
and while pakistani officials believe that the war against terrorism has made their country a respectable member of the international community , there is a general feeling in pakistan that germany ’ s new found love is dictated by washington . others discard such sentiments as myth .
but pakistan ’ s former ambassador to germany , asad durrani , is quick to stress that there is no essential link between u.s.-pakistan relations and those between pakistan and germany .
“ it is certainly possible for both countries to have a relationship which is not necessarily bedeviled by what may be happening between the united states and pakistan , " asad durrani told deutsche welle . high hopes pakistani business leaders have high hopes of musharraf 's visit to berlin .
pervez iftikhar , an engineer with the german engineering giant siemens , believes the visit should be used as a means of promoting economic relations to new levels .
he says germans have been investors in pakistan for decades and that bilateral relations , both on a human and business level go back a long way , and are very deep-rooted . during the first half of 2001 alone , germany imported goods totalling € 301 million from pakistan , according to figures supplied by the german foreign ministry .
during the same period , german companies exported € 220.5 million worth of goods - mostly chemical products , machinery , electronics , autos and ironware .
iftikhar said he hoped musharraf would seek to underline the huge investment potential in pakistan for the german corporate sector . “ i think there can be a lot of investment in hi-tech , in telecommunication , in the production of automobiles , in biotechnology , in the oil and gas sectors and similar fields , ” iftikhar told deutsche welle radio .
travel advisories observers say the german government holds the key to opening up its traditionally cautious corporate sector to pakistan by removing an advisory recommending that travelers avoid some parts of the country .

the decision by unions representing the airline 's 1,600 pilots comes just weeks after more than 400 job losses were announced .
the pact signed by management and unions , with their members ' approval , will see pilots ' pay cut by 16.5 % from july until march next year , while first officers ' pay will fall 11 % .
like its peers in asia , sia was hit hard by the collapse in passenger numbers following the outbreak of the sars respiratory virus , a setback which further damaged an aviation business already weakened by the global slowdown and the after-effects of the 11 september tragedy .
in april and may , the airline , 56 % of which is owned by singapore 's government , was losing $ 6m -lrb- £ 3.6m -rrb- a day .
give and take the agreement came at the last minute before the dispute between the airline and its staff over pay cuts went to arbitration .
earlier in the negotiations , the airline pilots association singapore -lrb- alpa-s -rrb- had accused management of wanting to slash salaries by as much as half .
in the end , both sides have given ground , with pilots agreeing to take two days off without pay each month .
in return , the airline 's executives have promised they will restore salaries should after-tax profits beat 500m singapore dollars in the year ending march 2004 .

the reductions in income tax are worth about 18bn euros -lrb- $ 20.6bn ; £ 12.3bn -rrb- , and look likely to come into force next year rather than in 2005 , as originally planned .
" we want a signal of revival to go out from this weekend to the people in our country , " mr schroeder told reporters following a weekend meeting of the german cabinet .
the government promises that the cuts will not breach european union rules on keeping budget shortfalls in check - despite fears in brussels to the contrary .
germany has already overshot the 3 % limit on budget deficits agreed in the late 1990s by european governments , as a means of stabilising the euro .
mr schroeder insisted that the cuts would be financed by subsidy cuts and the sale of shares in ex-state monopolies .
previous attempts to boost economic growth by trimming the welfare state have been very unpopular .
crowd pleaser ?
" this government is improving the framework for more growth in germany , " mr schroeder said .
" it 's the signal that we want to send to consumers and business , " he said .
germany 's economy is in its third year of near-zero growth and shrank 0.2 % in the first three months of this year .
earlier this week , the tabloid newspaper bild ran a headline saying the average german household would be more than 1,000 euros a year better off with the new tax cuts .
the chancellor said that advancing the tax cuts meant average wage-earners would pay 10 % less income tax next year .
" ten percent less tax means 10 % more consumption , " he added .
the tax cuts now due to take effect at the start of 2004 would slash the top rate of income tax to 42 % form 48.5 % and the bottom rate to 15 % from 19.9 % .
affordable ?
mr schroeder 's social democrat party has slumped in polls following september 's election , and the chancellor is keen to reverse the trend .
but critics say germany is following a similar policy to us president george w. bush , running up debts for tax cuts it can not afford .
mr schroeder will need the cooperation of the mainly conservative opposition , which controls the upper house of parliament , to bring the reforms into force .
conservative leaders have said they are willing to cooperate with mr schroeder to boost the economy , but they have cast doubt on how the tax plan can be paid for .
" of course we want tax relief , but not on credit and not with new tax hikes , " said edmund stoiber , head of the southern bavarian government and the loser by a hair 's breadth in last year 's german federal elections .
