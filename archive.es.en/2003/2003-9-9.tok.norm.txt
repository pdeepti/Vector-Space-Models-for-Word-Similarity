“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”

ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .
among those listed were deutsche bank , commerzbank , insurer allianz , lufthansa -lrb- photo -rrb- , siemens , trucking company man and software giant sap . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german skilled trades face apprenticeship crisis the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .

would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”
scotland game becomes crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts .
ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .
i 'm not like -lrb- former coaches -rrb- erich ribbeck and berti vogts .
i 'm not going to cling on to my job here .
it 's not worth it for me . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .
afterwards , coach rudi völler attacked journalists for expecting more .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .
among those listed were deutsche bank , commerzbank , insurer allianz , lufthansa -lrb- photo -rrb- , siemens , trucking company man and software giant sap . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german skilled trades face apprenticeship crisis the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .

völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .

" writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”
scotland game becomes crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts .
ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .
i 'm not like -lrb- former coaches -rrb- erich ribbeck and berti vogts .
i 'm not going to cling on to my job here .
it 's not worth it for me . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

the german consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- was unchanged in august from the figure for july and was 1.1 percent higher than it had been in august 2002 , the report stated .
the 12-month rate of inflation was therefore slightly faster than the previous month when the cost of living in germany , the biggest euro zone economy , rose by 0.9 percent year-on-year .
however , the annual inflation rate in germany is still far below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent .
the figures released on tuesday were lower than preliminary estimates published by the statistics office at the end of august , which had calculated that consumer prices in germany rose by 0.1 percent month-on-month and by 1.2 percent year-on-year in august . more briefs 09.09.2003 -pipe- domestic demand hits mercedes car sales 09.09.2003 -pipe- passenger numbers level out for lufthansa 09.09.2003 -pipe- interbrew sales up despite drop in german beer consumption 08.09.2003 -pipe- berlin 's publishing wars continue 08.09.2003 -pipe- germany spared penalties for breaching eu deficit limit 05.09.2003 -pipe- weak growth predicted for euro zone economies 05.09.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn satisfied with improved price system 05.09.2003 -pipe- strike means boost for german production levels radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the report attributed the stability to the rising demand on routes to the americas , the middle east and africa which was partially offset by sluggish demand in europe and the far east .
a total of 3.906 million passengers flew with lufthansa in august , down only fractionally by 0.4 percent from the figure in 2002 .
furthermore , on a month-on-month basis , passenger numbers were also stable compared with july , the statement said .
passenger numbers on routes to north and south america rose by 9.1 percent to 560,000 on a 12-month basis and the number of passengers flying with lufthansa to the middle east and africa jumped by 10.2 percent to 150,000 . more briefs 09.09.2003 -pipe- interbrew sales up despite drop in german beer consumption 08.09.2003 -pipe- berlin 's publishing wars continue 08.09.2003 -pipe- germany spared penalties for breaching eu deficit limit 05.09.2003 -pipe- weak growth predicted for euro zone economies 05.09.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn satisfied with improved price system 05.09.2003 -pipe- strike means boost for german production levels 05.09.2003 -pipe- german education minister bemoans lack of training posts 04.09.2003 -pipe- schröder welcomes french investment in defense firms radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.09.2003 schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough to go around - germany faces a disastrous dearth of internships for young graduates .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .

august 13 marks the 42nd anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall .
but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .
the disused church was torn down 24 years later . checkpoint charlie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first guard house at checkpoint charlie is erected .
more wall - this time just one layer - can be found on the cobblestone niederkirchner strasse , just down the street from berlin 's senate building and the former border crossing checkpoint charlie .
the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .
the east side gallery in the friedrichshain district of the city gives you the wall in color .
after east germany collapsed artists covered the once untouchable kilometer-long stretch on mühlenstrasse with paintings .
now they are flaking and gradually disintegrating , despite the efforts of artists to keep them up , and their future remains uncertain . on puschkinallee in the district of treptow you can go inside the only watchtower open to the public .
in 1990 young artists established the museum of forbidden art there and saved the four-story tower from demolition twice .
now the building is under historical protection . and if you 're feeling a sporty , rent a bike and take the berlin wall bike path .
you can trace the route , but you 're not likely to see many remains of the wall on the way .

august 13 marks the 42nd anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall .
but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .
the disused church was torn down 24 years later . checkpoint charlie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first guard house at checkpoint charlie is erected .
more wall - this time just one layer - can be found on the cobblestone niederkirchner strasse , just down the street from berlin 's senate building and the former border crossing checkpoint charlie .
the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .

but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .

the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .
price increases and a loss of sovereignty are two reasons often cited by those who plan to vote against admission to the union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2003 for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be dancing in estonia after the vote on eu membership ?
for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .
price increases and a loss of sovereignty are two reasons often cited by those who plan to vote against admission to the union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”
scotland game becomes crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts .
ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .
i 'm not like -lrb- former coaches -rrb- erich ribbeck and berti vogts .
i 'm not going to cling on to my job here .
it 's not worth it for me . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”
scotland game becomes crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts .
ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .
i 'm not like -lrb- former coaches -rrb- erich ribbeck and berti vogts .
i 'm not going to cling on to my job here .
it 's not worth it for me . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler lambastes german soccer critics germany ’ s national team barely managed to draw with soccer minnows iceland in an important european championship qualifying match on saturday .
afterwards , coach rudi völler attacked journalists for expecting more .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2003 for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be dancing in estonia after the vote on eu membership ?
for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .
price increases and a loss of sovereignty are two reasons often cited by those who plan to vote against admission to the union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .

" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .

völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2003 for estonia , eu membership is n't the only identity crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there be dancing in estonia after the vote on eu membership ?
for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .
' it depends on the person ' olga , an 18 year old who says she has no estonian speaking friends or acquaintances , was born in the capital , tallinn .
" i would say that estonians have better opportunities .
its easier for them to have success in their own country , " olga said .
still , she conceded , " everything really depends on the person .
if they try hard , and speak estonian , maybe they have the same chances " as native estonians .
according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .
" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .
many citizens of the formerly communist country suffered hardships in the transition to a market economy , and view eu membership as another painful transition .
price increases and a loss of sovereignty are two reasons often cited by those who plan to vote against admission to the union . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de estonia : ethnic strife , booming economy estonia is one of the front-runners in the race for eu membership .
but polls indicate its citizens do n't care much .
many think they can do without the eu .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .
in the beginnning of the 1990s , many native estonians " hoped most russians would leave estonia , " parliamentarian vladimir vellmann told deutsche welle .
he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .

according to parliamentarian vellmann , whose own mother comes from russia and whose father is estonian , official discrimination no longer exists .
" the best thing that estonia has achieved is the complete disappearance of nationalism in daily life , " he said .
it is critical that the country get rid of discrimination on a social level as well , vellmann said .

" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .

" if the state of estonia is to survive , the newest generation of estonians need to be raised as patriots , " he said - specifically , estonian patriots in a european context .
" estonia is simply too small to remain on its own , " vellmann said .
first russians furthermore , an estonian " yes " on eu membership would bring the first ethnic russians into the european union , vellmann pointed out .
" that could only be a benefit for europe . "
opinion polls show more estonians in favor of joining the european union than against it , but the slim margin suggests a " yes " vote on referendum day is anything but certain .
despite its enthusiastic hosting of the eurovision song contest in may 2002 , there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.09.2003 schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough to go around - germany faces a disastrous dearth of internships for young graduates .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .
among those listed were deutsche bank , commerzbank , insurer allianz , lufthansa -lrb- photo -rrb- , siemens , trucking company man and software giant sap . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german skilled trades face apprenticeship crisis the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .
in germany most people think that there are only ponies and geysers in iceland . ”
scotland game becomes crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berti vogts .
ironically , vogts could conceivably heap more misery on his counterpart ’ s shoulders as his scotland side comes to dortmund ’ s westfalen stadium on wednesday to face off against germany in a game that takes on even more importance now .
another lackluster performance or even defeat at the hands of the scots would bring rudi völler back into the firing line and maybe even out of the door .
as he said on saturday : “ i 'm not going to put up with this for long .

after waking up a snoozing nation with an outburst after his team ’ s dull performance against iceland on saturday , german soccer coach rudi völler found on monday that many respected germans supported his comments . the german nation had held its breath for a remarkable two days .
the usually unflappable rudi völler , the mild mannered , bubble permed man known as " aunt " rudi , had blown up on saturday in the wake of what many had dared to call yet another disappointing performance by the german national soccer team against iceland in the european championship qualifiers . the silence on sunday was deafening as the calmer , yet still unrepentant , rudi smiled sheepishly for the cameras at the squad ’ s training ground and signed autographs at arms length for wary spectators after his team had been put through its paces . then on monday , the collective sigh came .
germany ’ s soccer fans gasped for air as the vacuum of comment began to be filled .
would one of the most popular coaches in the history of the german national team survive the fallout from his expletive filled televised outburst ?
would experts in the game round on the highly decorated former player and the man who took an unlikely side to the 2002 world cup final ?
the responses were enough to make even the hardest german supporter faint with relief . soccer legends and politicians offer support instead of calling for rudi ’ s grey and curly scalp , soccer legends , pundits and even politicians came out in support of völler and his passionate response to the criticism that had so obviously pushed him to the edge . while chancellor gerhard schröder , a self-confessed soccer fanatic , refused to comment on the affair at this time , his fellow social democrat , interior minister otto schilly , said he understood völler ’ s reaction to the criticism he and the team had received .
“ it was the final straw , ” he said .
“ journalists must not practice such arrogance . ” bavarian premier edmund stoiber said : “ i understand rudi völler .
this malice , this dragging through the mud has to stop . ” german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder addressed a press conference on monday to offer the dfb ’ s guarded support of its man .
" rudi comes from the football world and not from university .
his language can be a bit crude but every word he says should not be interpreted as an insult to the german nation . " ard commentators " a load of crap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer .
völler lost his cool after the game in reykjavik in an interview with broadcaster ard , telling the german television station that commentator gerhard delling ’ s analysis of a poor german performance was " a load of crap " and singling out former germany star turned pundit günther netzer for abuse for his constant negative comments about the german team . “ i ca n't take it any more - i 'm fed up with the constant criticism .
all this shit really ticks me off , ” völler raged .
“ i do n't agree with delling and netzer , who spoke of a new low for saturday night entertainment - that 's ridiculous , they always find a new low . ” “ once we 've hit rock bottom , they say we can fall even deeper , ” he continued .
“ that 's shit ; i ca n't hear it any longer . ” former coaches close ranks many of völler ’ s former teammates , colleagues and counterparts still working in the game also chose to let the dust settle before defending the incumbent german coach .
the messages of support started with two men well accustomed to the pressures of the top job : former national team coaches franz beckenbauer and berti vogts , who manages germany ’ s next opponent , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer .
" i can understand it because i often enough talked back in similar situations , " said beckenbauer , who led germany to its 1990 world cup victory and captained the side to the ultimate prize in 1974 .
" you feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks . this has been building up in rudi for weeks now and has broken through .
this is human , now he 'll just have to collect himself again . " writing in monday ’ s bild tabloid , which had christened völler " rambo rudi , " beckenbauer added he had felt similar feelings when he was in charge of the german team at the 1986 world cup in mexico and understood the pressure völler was under .
“ i realized that we only had an average team and the expectations were immense , ” he said . vogts also said that he could understand völler ’ s actions , saying he knows the feeling well when an unfancied side like iceland tests the team and prompts critics to question the coach .
“ i know that feeling when you 're described to everybody as an idiot , ” vogts told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
“ ten years back when i was in charge i was the fool .

for estonia and its russian minority , the upcoming vote on eu membership is the latest stop on a long road of intercultural conflict .
but right now , all ethnic groups are facing hardships . about a third of estonia 's population is made up of russian speakers , whose parents or grandparents came to the small baltic state as migrant workers or students .
yet since the fall of the iron curtain , estonian nationals and the russian-speaking minority have been at odds .
following its independence from the soviet union 12 years ago , there has been heated debate in estonia over whether russian speakers should get citizenship - and especially over the demand that , in order to do so , they needed speak estonian .
social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .

social woes yet today , with the unemployment rate soaring at aproximately 10 percent and average monthly income of around € 400 -lrb- $ 445 -rrb- , estonians of all ethnic groups are affected by issues such as poverty and joblessness .

he admitted that the idea was " naive ... now , most estonians have come to accept that there is a large minority of people whose origins are russian , ukrainian , white russian , etc .
we have gotten used to one another . "
yet if you ask young or old russian speakers in estonia whether they feel they have equal rights in their country , they tend to say that the estonians have it easier .
when pressed for specifics , many say estonians may have an easier time because of the language .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo . german chancellor gerhard schröder met with the heads of the country ’ s trade unions after a two-month break on monday .
unlike past acrimonious meetings dominated by strident opposition among the unions to the chancellor ’ s raft of economic and labor reforms , this time the two sides were in consensus on a key issue plaguing the labor market : the dire lack of apprenticeships for germany ’ s high school graduates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder , who had vowed an " open dialogue " with the trade unions about his " agenda 2010 " economic reforms ahead of monday ’ s talks , showed himself willing to listen to the unions ’ grievances about the disastrous apprenticeship situation .
the chancellor admitted there was a problem .
" it has to get better , " schröder said after the meeting .
with thousands of high school graduates expected to be in search of an apprenticeship this autumn , the chancellor appealed to companies to fulfill their obligations in filling apprenticeship spots and threatened that " legal measures would be necessary " if businesses failed to create more opportunites voluntarily .
punishing companies for not hiring apprentices trade unions in germany have long been demanding the imposition of a fine on companies that didn ’ t train graduates or offered few apprenticeships .
in a television interview last week , schröder emphasized that " those who trained apprentices , should be given a respite , while those who refuse to hire apprentices , should be reined in . "
he refused to say how exactly the government expected to push companies to hire apprentices .
" this is a question of solidarity , i don ’ t what to talk of force , " schröder added .
the chancellor added on monday that if companies were indeed fined , it would have to be done on a branch specific basis and made as unbureaucratic as possible .
schröder also made clear that companies had a deadline of september 30 to fill in apprenticeships , but added it wasn ’ t an ultimatum and that apprentices could be hired even after that date .
trade unions gleeful about chancellor 's stance the chancellor ’ s stance and " clear words " have been welcomed by the unions .
though trade union leaders reiterated their vehement opposition to the chancellor ’ s " agenda 2010 " labor reforms , they were clearly pleased with schröder ’ s pro-union position when it came to apprenticeships .
frank bsirske , head of the country ’ s largest services union , ver.di , said he hoped it would help guide young people out of a " working trap " and stressed he was in favor of introducing a penalty on companies which were not doing their bit in hiring apprentices .
michael sommer , head of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , pointed out that there was a shortfall of 113,000 apprenticeships at the beginning of the month and said he expected a further 10,000 young graduates to be looking for an apprenticeship by the end of september .
industry leaders up in arms but schröder ’ s latest move to end graduates ’ job misery and to lay the groundwork for a solid and well-trained workforce has rubbed industry leaders up the wrong way at a time when they are already suffering in these bleak economic times .
dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ’ association , told the daily berliner zeitung that " repeated threats " from trade unions and politicians to fine companies not hiring enough apprentices was " highly counter-productive " and would lead to less apprenticeships , not more .
dieter philipp , president of the german skilled trades association , said , " such threats only lead to the fact that companies increasingly hold back with hiring more apprentices . "
unexpected support for companies has come from within schröder ’ s own social democrat ranks , with german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement saying he feared a state-run apprenticeship program if the government decided to fine companies for not hiring trainees .
clement said he was skeptical about the effectiveness of legal measures and said he was sure that companies and commerce chambers would create more apprenticeships .
" i belong to those who are convinced that acting voluntarily is better , it promises more success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa however a report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday threw a pall on the hopeful outcome of the meeting between the chancellor and the unions .
the paper said that numerous large companies would be hiring less apprentices this year as compared to 2002 .
among those listed were deutsche bank , commerzbank , insurer allianz , lufthansa -lrb- photo -rrb- , siemens , trucking company man and software giant sap . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german skilled trades face apprenticeship crisis the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .

august 13 marks the 42nd anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall .
but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .
the disused church was torn down 24 years later . checkpoint charlie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first guard house at checkpoint charlie is erected .
more wall - this time just one layer - can be found on the cobblestone niederkirchner strasse , just down the street from berlin 's senate building and the former border crossing checkpoint charlie .
the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .
the east side gallery in the friedrichshain district of the city gives you the wall in color .
after east germany collapsed artists covered the once untouchable kilometer-long stretch on mühlenstrasse with paintings .
now they are flaking and gradually disintegrating , despite the efforts of artists to keep them up , and their future remains uncertain . on puschkinallee in the district of treptow you can go inside the only watchtower open to the public .
in 1990 young artists established the museum of forbidden art there and saved the four-story tower from demolition twice .
now the building is under historical protection . and if you 're feeling a sporty , rent a bike and take the berlin wall bike path .
you can trace the route , but you 're not likely to see many remains of the wall on the way .
only a fourth of the expanse cut through the built-up city , so expect to meander through the surrounding countryside for most of the time and get a first-rate sense of where the locals - whether from east or west – spent and continue to spend their summers , at the lakes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kennedy still a ' berliner ' after all these years thursday marks the 40th anniversary of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech .

august 13 marks the 42nd anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall .
but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .

the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .

but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .
the disused church was torn down 24 years later . checkpoint charlie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first guard house at checkpoint charlie is erected .
more wall - this time just one layer - can be found on the cobblestone niederkirchner strasse , just down the street from berlin 's senate building and the former border crossing checkpoint charlie .
the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .

august 13 marks the 42nd anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall .
but these days visitors to germany 's capital may be hard-pressed to locate remnants of the formerly divided city 's most famous sight . tourists in paris visit the eiffel tower , prague 's guests cross the charles bridge and in berlin vacationers go to the wall . if they can find it . for almost 30 years it was berlin 's most famous landmark , but now the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " as it was called in communist east germany , is n't easy to locate . visitors still anxious to explore one of the symbols of the cold war are n't entirely out of luck .
though most of the 155-kilometers -lrb- 96 miles -rrb- of concrete wall and fences were dismantled years ago , bits and pieces of the border construction encircling west berlin are still on view . the most realistic - and least visited - place to find remains of the wall is bernauer strasse on the border between the mitte -lrb- east -rrb- and wedding -lrb- west -rrb- districts .
it was here that east berliners started trying to jump out of the windows of apartment buildings into the west on august 13 , 1961 , as the wall was being built . recreating the death strip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall memorial at bernauer strasse at bernauer strasse you see that the wall actually came in twos .
from the eastern side of the wall memorial you can peek through gaps in the original concrete plates that made up the structure and get a vague sense of the oppressiveness of the wall .
instead of a view of the west you see a wasteland of weeds and lampposts and behind them another concrete sheath , the second wall that was erected right next to west berlin territory . for an extensive view of the former death strip climb up the recently opened tower at the nearby berlin wall documentation center to the viewing platform .
the documentation center tells the history of the wall , and the adjacent chapel of reconciliation recalls the protestant church that was off-limits to the public after the wall was built on either side of it .
the disused church was torn down 24 years later . checkpoint charlie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first guard house at checkpoint charlie is erected .
more wall - this time just one layer - can be found on the cobblestone niederkirchner strasse , just down the street from berlin 's senate building and the former border crossing checkpoint charlie .
the fall of the wall in november 1989 looks like it was just yesterday here , where the concrete plates are covered in graffiti and the metal girders gape from holes chipped in the fortification . flanked by replicas of the guard houses that once stood at the border crossing where the american sector of berlin ended and the soviet sector began , the museum haus on checkpoint charlie also features a permanent exhibition on the wall , including many of the original contraptions used by the more than 5,000 people who managed to escape over or under it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strollers pass the east side gallery .
the east side gallery in the friedrichshain district of the city gives you the wall in color .
after east germany collapsed artists covered the once untouchable kilometer-long stretch on mühlenstrasse with paintings .
now they are flaking and gradually disintegrating , despite the efforts of artists to keep them up , and their future remains uncertain . on puschkinallee in the district of treptow you can go inside the only watchtower open to the public .
in 1990 young artists established the museum of forbidden art there and saved the four-story tower from demolition twice .
now the building is under historical protection . and if you 're feeling a sporty , rent a bike and take the berlin wall bike path .
you can trace the route , but you 're not likely to see many remains of the wall on the way .

arms ' create jobs ' a spokesman for organisers defence systems & equipment international insisted the event , which is being opened by uk defence secretary geoff hoon , was not an arms fair .
" this is an exhibition , mainly for contractors and sub-contractors .
it 's an industry-to-industry show , " he said .
every exhibitor signed a form saying it would not bring illegal weapons systems , and these were monitored by the mod , he said .
about half the exhibitors are british firms , with 20 % from the us and the remainder from other nato countries .
a spokesman for the mod 's defence export services organisation said : " we have strict export licence criteria and going to the exhibition in no way implies that you can buy the equipment .
" defence brings £ 5 billion a year to the uk and benefits between 70,000 and 100,000 jobs . "
