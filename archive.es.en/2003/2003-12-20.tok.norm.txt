he only admitted to having the account last year after repeatedly denying its existence .
mr menem could be banned from public office if found guilty .
he has said the account was opened in 1986 with $ 200,000 from a legal settlement he won after being imprisoned as a political prisoner .
interest gains mr menem said the account is legal and that the interest earned on the money meant the sum had grown to $ 600,000 .
argentine prosecutors are investigating the origins of the money .
mr menem , 74 , ran for president earlier this year but pulled out after the first round .
an argentine judge in august had dropped charges against him which related to arms sales .
he had been freed from house arrest in november 2001 after the supreme court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove accusations that he headed an " illicit association " dealing in weapons .
his presidency from 1989 to 1999 was plagued by corruption scandals .

the winning discoveries provide further evidence that the universe is composed largely of dark matter and dark energy .
the eagerly awaited top 10 , which is compiled annually by the journal science , is always controversial , and this year 's proves to be no exception .
second place went to scientists who identified genes for mental illness .
particular mention was given to studies that found genes responsible for increasing a person 's risk of schizophrenia , depression and bipolar disorder .
third place was taken by the authors of studies appearing to show evidence of global climate change .
' convincing evidence ' " the consensus about global warming has reached a point where it 's very difficult indeed to deny what 's going on , " don kennedy , editor-in-chief of science , told bbc news online .
the papers included a study which linked unusually warm waters in the western pacific and indian oceans to the products of greenhouse gases and research demonstrating increases in the flows of rivers emptying into the arctic ocean .
mapping of galaxies helped provide the evidence for dark matter the list of breakthroughs was decided by science magazine 's news and editorial teams .
" we looked for science that would lead to new things .
not necessarily applications in human service , but new extensions of human knowledge , " mr kennedy added .
of the position of top breakthrough , awarded to researchers who had elucidated the nature of dark energy and dark matter , the journal said : " -lsb- this -rsb- ends a decades-long argument about the nature of the universe and confirms that our cosmos is much , much stranger than we ever imagined . "
cosmic microwaves the " concordance " model of the universe proposes that over 70 % is made up of dark energy , with around 25 % composed of dark matter and only 5 % of normal matter .
in this model , dark matter is constantly being stretched by dark energy .
in february , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe -lrb- wmap -rrb- satellite took the most detailed picture yet of the cosmic microwave background - an image of the infant cosmos when it was less than 400,000 years old .
in july , astronomers from the sloan digital sky survey -lrb- sdss -rrb- , which aims to map out a million galaxies , published a research paper in which they superimposed their own galaxy-clustering data on wmap 's microwave data .
they claim the results prove that dark energy must exist .
but on friday -lrb- 12 december -rrb- , an international group of astronomers claimed analysis of data returned from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- xmm-newton satellite observatory casts doubt on the existence of dark energy .
the astronomers measured the quantity and energy of x-rays emitted by eight distant galaxy clusters .
they say their results may imply that the density of matter in the universe is very high , contradicting the popular concordance model .
" to account for these results you have to have a lot of matter in the universe and that leaves little room for dark energy , " said alain blanchard of the observatoire midi-pyrenees in france .
fuller details of the top 10 list are outlined below : science magazine 's breakthroughs of the year 1 .
illuminating the dark universe .
satellite and telescope data cemented the idea that the universe is composed mainly of dark energy and dark matter .
2 .
cracking mental illness .
researchers identified genes that reliably increase one 's risk of inherited disorders , such as schizophrenia , depression and bipolar disorder .
3 .
climate change impacts .
scientists reported melting ice , droughts , decreased plant productivity , and altered plant and animal behaviour .
4 .
rna advances .
scientists explored how small ribonucleic acids -lrb- rnas -rrb- impact cell behaviour , from early development to gene expression .
5 .
zooming in on single molecules .
collaborations between biologists and physicists captured the activities of individual molecules inside cells .
6 .
starbursts and gamma rays .
scientists improved our understanding of the most energetic explosions in the universe : tremendous blasts of energy called gamma ray bursts .
7 .
spontaneous sperm and egg cells .
the observation that embryonic stem cells can develop into both sperm and eggs may help scientists learn how some kinds of infertility arise .
8 .
left-handed materials .
several research teams confirmed that certain high-tech materials can bend light and other electromagnetic radiation in the " wrong " direction .
9 .
the self-reliant y chromosome .
the genetic sequence of the human male y chromosome revealed it has duplicate genes .
thus , when mutations arise and a new gene is needed , a twin copy is on hand .
10 .
possible cancer therapies in june , researchers announced that a drug which limits the blood supply to tumours , given with chemotherapy drugs in a large clinical trial , prolonged the lives of patients with advanced colon cancer .

they say their results may imply that the density of matter in the universe is very high , contradicting the popular concordance model .
" to account for these results you have to have a lot of matter in the universe and that leaves little room for dark energy , " said alain blanchard of the observatoire midi-pyrenees in france .

the winning discoveries provide further evidence that the universe is composed largely of dark matter and dark energy .
the eagerly awaited top 10 , which is compiled annually by the journal science , is always controversial , and this year 's proves to be no exception .
second place went to scientists who identified genes for mental illness .
particular mention was given to studies that found genes responsible for increasing a person 's risk of schizophrenia , depression and bipolar disorder .
third place was taken by the authors of studies appearing to show evidence of global climate change .
' convincing evidence ' " the consensus about global warming has reached a point where it 's very difficult indeed to deny what 's going on , " don kennedy , editor-in-chief of science , told bbc news online .
the papers included a study which linked unusually warm waters in the western pacific and indian oceans to the products of greenhouse gases and research demonstrating increases in the flows of rivers emptying into the arctic ocean .
the list of breakthroughs was decided by science magazine 's news and editorial teams .
" we looked for science that would lead to new things .
not necessarily applications in human service , but new extensions of human knowledge , " mr kennedy added .
of the position of top breakthrough , awarded to researchers who had elucidated the nature of dark energy and dark matter , the journal said : " -lsb- this -rsb- ends a decades-long argument about the nature of the universe and confirms that our cosmos is much , much stranger than we ever imagined . "
cosmic microwaves the " concordance " model of the universe proposes that over 70 % is made up of dark energy , with around 25 % composed of dark matter and only 5 % of normal matter .
in this model , dark matter is constantly being stretched by dark energy .
in february , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe -lrb- wmap -rrb- satellite took the most detailed picture yet of the cosmic microwave background - an image of the infant cosmos when it was less than 400,000 years old .
in july , astronomers from the sloan digital sky survey -lrb- sdss -rrb- , which aims to map out a million galaxies , published a research paper in which they superimposed their own galaxy-clustering data on wmap 's microwave data .
they claim the results prove that dark energy must exist .
but on friday -lrb- 12 december -rrb- , an international group of astronomers claimed analysis of data returned from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- xmm-newton satellite observatory casts doubt on the existence of dark energy .

little-known mp mamadou bhoye barry , is challenging general conte 's administration at sunday 's elections .
frad , the opposition grouping , has asked for the elections to be called off due to the president 's ill-health .
guinea has large reserves of minerals but widespread corruption has run down its economy .
ailing economy about five million people are registered to vote at sunday 's poll and official results are expected on monday . "
the level of fraud they are cooking up for us is so massive , we know we can have nothing to do with this election " siradiou diallo an opposition leader government officials acknowledge that the president , who has been in power for two decades , has acute diabetes .

in 2001 , voters approved a national referendum that amended the constitution to remove age limits for the presidency and expanded the term in office from five to seven years .
" the level of fraud they are cooking up for us is so massive , we know we can have nothing to do with this election " siradiou diallo , an opposition leader told the ap news agency .
coup human rights groups have accused the government of widespread abuses .
but the us government has rewarded guinea with military support , and credited president conte with maintaining relative stability in a region rocked by civil wars .
since independence from france in 1958 , guinea has known only one other ruler - sekou toure .
president sekou toure died in 1984 during a heart surgery in the us .
a week later , lansana conte , then an army colonel , staged a bloodless coup and has ruled the country ever since , surviving military revolts .
he won multi-party elections in 1993 and 1998 which the opposition also claim were rigged .

ruth christoffersen , from newport , south wales , lost her 28-year-old daughter emma to air-related dvt after a flight from australia in 2000 .
she has since become a tireless campaigner , fighting to raise awareness of the dangers of the condition .
on saturday she will be joined by relatives of other victims in john frost square , newport , to gather support for a change in legislation which would make airlines take responsibility for the health of passengers .
the families of those who died have formed a support and campaigning group , families of victims of air-related dvt -lrb- varda -rrb- .
they will be joined by vale of glamorgan mp john smith , who has raised their concerns in the house of commons .
emma had just returned from sydney in july , three senior judges reinforced a decision that airlines could not be held liable if passengers developed dvt - under the terms of the 1929 warsaw convention .
relatives had joined together to appeal against the original ruling , but described the decision to dismiss their appeal as a " major blow " .
they said they would be prepared to take their fight to the house of lords .
a court last year ruled the airlines were not liable , but gave the victims leave to appeal .
many of the 55 claimants in that case could not afford to continue the legal process .
the ruling in december was based on the 1929 warsaw convention which says dvt can not be classed as an " accident " , and therefore airlines can not be held responsible .
in deep vein thrombosis , a blood clot which develops , usually in the leg , when movement is restricted .
it can be fatal if the clot reaches the lungs or brain .
several british travellers have died after flights and the claimants accused the airlines of not warning passengers about the risks .

the mast at wishaw led to a number of protests by villagers who blamed it for a cluster of cancer cases .
representatives from the wishaw campaign group met council planning chiefs last week to discuss their concerns .
the authority has now agreed to write to the government asking for an inquiry into the effects of mobile phone masts on people 's health .
alternative site the 22-metre mast fell down on bonfire night after bolts were removed from the base , in what police described as an act of vandalism .
following its removal , villagers staged a blockade at the site to stop a new one being erected .
they bought the old one back from a scrapyard and plan to sell pieces of it to fund their campaign .
villagers said the mast would go back up " over their dead bodies " .
crown castle communications had said it would work with the residents to find an alternative site .
but then the company changed its mind following a statement from mobile phone network t-mobile , which said it was determined to put the mast back up .
overnight vigils will continue at the site to ensure the mast does not reappear , say protestors .

libya is trying to repair international relations the move by colonel muammar gaddafi and the capture of saddam hussein are two very welcome seasonal presents for president bush and prime minister blair .
it will help to soften their disappointment that no such weapons have been found in iraq .
and it shows that countries can be persuaded not to go down the path of developing weapons of mass destruction .
the message to north korea , iran and syria in particular is clear .
if you co-operate , you will benefit .
if you do not , there will be trouble .
un sanctions 1992/1993 un imposes an air , arms and oil equipment ban on libya to get tripoli to hand over lockerbie suspects 1999 sanctions suspended when libya turns them over september 2003 sanctions lifted after compensation agreed over lockerbie and with france over 1989 bombing of a french airliner dr gary samore of the international institute for strategic studies -lrb- iiss -rrb- in london said : " we want to get the word out that if countries give up their programmes , there will be rewards . "
colonel 's initiative colonel gaddafi appears to have got the message of iraq - that developing such weapons or even showing an interest in them is highly dangerous .
us sanctions 1981 president ronald reagan bans use of us passports for travel to libya 1982 imports of libyan oil and some exports banned 1986 after the berlin disco bombing , sanctions are widened to include direct import and export trade 1996 iran-libya sanctions act is passed .
2001 act amended to allow punishment of non-us firms investing in iran and libya 's energy sectors 2003 washington says it will maintain us sanctions after un sanctions lifted timeline of sanctions it was perhaps no coincidence that he approached britain and the united states in march , the very moment that saddam hussein was being driven from power .
libya has another motive , though , in making this decision .
it 's the culmination of its policy of re-engaging with the outside world .
the mercurial colonel gaddafi , who has been in power since 1969 , realized that a new wind was blowing and he wanted to come in from the cold .
first he had to settle the issues arising from the lockerbie bombing , which he did earlier this year with an admission of libyan responsibility and a $ 2 billion compensation payment .
that got un sanctions lifted .
but he needed bilateral american sanctions removed as well because these hold up development of his oil .
libya remains a major oil producer .
it is seventh in the opec oil cartel 's top 10 .
but it needs to modernise .
the colonel knew he had to do more and he has now promised to do so in a typically dramatic fashion .
us sanctions there is still some way to go .
the united states has yet to lift its own sanctions .
these are a ban on trade - including oil - and penalties for non-us companies which invest more than $ 20m a year in libya 's oil industry .
and washington still classifies libya as a state sponsor of terrorism .
however , president bush hinted that the united states might soon move , presumably if libya keeps its word .
" leaders who abandon the pursuit of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them will find an open path to better relations with the united states and other free nations , " he said it has often been alleged that libya was trying to develop chemical weapons , though the extent of this programme was unclear .
dr gary samore of the iiss said : " libya is believed to have had a chemical weapons programme for 20 years . "
in 1987 , its neighbour chad accused it of using mustard gas in a conflict there .
nuclear research the big surprise , though is its reported development of nuclear technology , though exactly how far this got remains to be clarified by international inspectors .
it is an amazing turnaround for colonel gaddafi , whose own compound was bombed on the orders of ronald reagan in 1986 over the years , colonel gaddafi has hinted that libya and other arab states should go nuclear because israel has .
the federation of american scientists , however , made this assessment : " in recent years , concerns about libyan nuclear ambitions have faded , though apprehensions about libyan chemical weapons efforts remain very much alive . "
libya is no position to obtain access to nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future , given the extremely limited domestic technical base of the country . "
until now , it was assumed that libya 's membership of the nuclear non proliferation treaty meant that inspections by the international atomic energy agency were effective .
if they have not been , that is very worrying .
another important aspect of the agreement with libya is its undertaking not to develop missiles with a range beyond 300 kilometres .
dr samore said that this limit has been set by the group of supplier countries known as the missile technology control regime .
the mtcr reckons that a missile with a shorter range -lrb- and payload of less than 500 kilograms -rrb- is unlikely to deliver nuclear weapons , so can be regarded as a tactical weapon .
it is an amazing turnaround for colonel gaddafi , whose own compound was bombed on the orders of ronald reagan in 1986 .
he has also supplied the ira with weapons .
now he is being lauded by both the us and the uk .

hampshire police say more than 300 officers will be deployed to oversee the expected 32,000 fans at southampton 's st mary 's stadium .
in addition , many pubs in southampton city centre will not open before the match kicks off at 1230 gmt .
sixteen fans were arrested after the carling cup game between the teams on 2 december amid violent scenes outside a number of city centre pubs .
chief superintendent paul stickler said : " it is an unfortunate fact , apparent from the last match , that a very small minority attend the game with the intention of causing trouble for others .
" the game itself will be attended by more than 32,000 fans young and old , including many families with children .
" we will have more than 300 officers on duty who will police the match fairly and robustly to ensure the day is not spoiled for anyone . "
there will be fewer away fans at the game , as less tickets are available to travelling supporters than for the carling cup fixture .

bbc news -pipe- in depth -pipe- who 's who in the ' axis of evil ' home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 20 december , 2003 , 11:32 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version who 's who in the ' axis of evil ' by frank gardner bbc security correspondent the original " axis of evil " list , pronounced by us president george w bush in 2002 , comprised iraq , iran and north korea .
us undersecretary of state john bolton has said that syria , libya and cuba are also candidates .
so what is the us case against these countries and what are its options now ?
syria the us state department accuses syria of supporting terrorism and harbouring palestinian groups it classes as terrorists .
the us has also accused syria of playing an unhelpful role during and after the war in iraq , allowing large numbers of armed volunteers to cross its borders to fight against the us-led coalition in iraq .
syria denies it supports terrorists and denies any suggestions that it has given shelter to senior members of ousted iraqi president saddam hussein 's former regime .
the official view in damascus - which is shared by much of the arab world - is that palestinian resistance groups are not terrorists but " freedom fighters " who have a legitimate right to resist israeli occupation of arab land .
to punish syria , a us congressional committee has proposed introducing sanctions , with a bill that accuses syria of sponsoring terrorists , occupying lebanon with more than 20,000 troops and trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- .
washington needs syria , but the question is how much ?
there can never be a comprehensive arab-israeli peace deal without syria 's signature but negotiations have all but ceased .
since the 11 september 2001 attacks , however , washington has found syria to be a useful partner in combating osama bin laden 's al-qaeda .
damascus shares some intelligence with the cia and is known to have passed on the results of at least one interrogation , that of mohammed haydar zammar , a man accused of having links with al-qaeda .
if it ever came to conflict in the future , syria 's armed forces would be no match for those of either israel or the pentagon .
its large and undoubtedly tough army relies on equipment that is often more than 30 years old .
the air force is incapable of effectively defending syrian airspace and its navy poses little threat to anyone .
however , syria does have a number of medium and long-range surface-to-surface missiles .
israel says it believes these missiles can be armed with both chemical and biological weapons - if that assessment is correct then this would be a powerful deterrent to any full scale military attack .
back to top iran iran 's nuclear programme is worrying almost everyone now , not just the us , which has long classed the islamic republic as " a state sponsor of terrorism " .
tehran insists its nuclear ambitions are purely civilian and that it has the right to develop its own home-grown energy programme .
but inspectors from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , have discovered suspicious traces of enriched uranium at sites in iran .
so washington believes , as do several countries , that iran is only a few years away from building a nuclear bomb .
since the us also accuses iran of supporting terrorists and obstructing peace in the middle east , it is clearly worried by the situation .
on 9 october us undersecretary of state john bolton - a noted hawk in the administration - said : " the risk of outward iranian proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to other countries in the region is -lsb- also -rsb- a risk we take very seriously . "
america 's options in iran are limited .
the west has very limited influence over the people who take the decisions there regarding national security - they are mostly hardliners opposed to the us .
for now , hope rests with the un 's nuclear inspectors .
but if iran fails to give them full access then , over time , other countries in the region - such as saudi arabia - may be tempted to try to acquire their own nuclear deterrents , thereby setting off a middle east arms race .
if iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , the country with most to fear would be israel .
the last time a country in the region appeared to begin work on such weapons the israelis carried out a pre-emptive strike .
in 1981 the israeli air force raided and destroyed iraq 's french-built osirak nuclear reactor .
there was widespread outrage , but it set back saddam hussein 's nuclear ambitions by nearly 20 years .
israel has not ruled out doing the same with iran .
back to top iraq with the defeat of saddam hussein 's regime in baghdad , iraq 's alleged wmd capability has turned out to be far less fearsome than we were led to believe .
at the time of writing , no actual wmd have been found , despite months of searching by the coalition 's 1200-strong iraq survey group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
that group 's interim report has been seized on by critics as proof the iraqi threat was grossly exaggerated .
however , the report does detail extensive evidence that saddam hussein had not given up his ambitions to develop wmd .
so the isg report has equally been seized on by the us and british governments as a vindication that the former iraqi leader was an international menace who needed to be disarmed .
the troubling question is this .
if those lethal weapons really did exist at the outbreak of war in march 2003 , then where are they now ?
the nightmare for the west , however improbable , is that iraq 's alleged chemical and biological weapons could fall into the hands of unscrupulous terrorists linked to or inspired by al-qaeda .
back to top north korea this is the hardest case of all .
the isolated , bankrupt and almost impenetrable communist state of kim jong-il has hinted that it may already be in a position to build several nuclear bombs .
in october 2002 , us satellite reconnaissance revealed north korea was secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in contravention of a deal made with the clinton administration .
faced with the evidence , the north koreans did not deny it .
they then expelled the un 's nuclear inspectors and withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
us undersecretary of state john bolton has described the ruler , kim jong-il , as " a dictator " .
in return , north korea called him " human scum " .
regional talks mediated by china have so far failed to resolve the issue of the nuclear programme .
but there are also concerns over north korea 's long-range missile programme .
it has already tested its missiles over the northern pacific and it has been an avid exporter of missile technology to the volatile middle east .
scud-type missiles deployed by iran , iraq , syria and other countries are nearly all derived from north korean know-how .
pakistan denies the suggestion that it traded its nuclear weapons expertise for north korean missile technology .
there are many who would argue that north korea 's dangerous and unpredictable regime was a far more worthy candidate for replacement than that of saddam hussein 's in iraq .
but there is a compelling reason why the us is reluctant to get into a military confrontation with north korea .
even without a nuclear bomb , kim jong-il could retaliate with enough missiles , field artillery and chemical weapons to flatten the nearby south korean capital , seoul .
casualties would also be high amongst the 37,000 us troops based in south korea , while the economic impact on neighbouring countries such as japan could be catastrophic .
hence nobody in the region - except possibly elements of the north korean leadership - wants to see a conflict .
back to top cuba of all the countries on the us list of so-called " rogue states " , the case is the weakest for cuba .
like libya , it has been ruled for decades by a now-ageing revolutionary who is tiring of the economic penalties that come with being treated as a pariah by washington .
fidel castro is certainly no democrat and president bush would dearly love to see him replaced by someone more amenable to the us .
but the accusation made last year by the us undersecretary of state john bolton that cuba had a biological weapons programme was widely derided .
his boss , us secretary of state colin powell , was obliged to clarify the us position , saying he did not believe cuba had bio-weapons , merely the capability to conduct biological research for offensive purposes - a charge that could be levelled at scores of countries around the world .
in military terms cuba presents little threat to anyone .
although during the cold war it sent troops to angola , these days its armed forces are withering through underfunding .
the collapse of its former benefactor , the soviet union , has deprived its once powerful air force of spare parts .
at just 60,000 troops , its army has shrunk to less than a third of the size it was 10 years ago .
fidel castro is now approaching his 80th birthday .
the us is unlikely to want to precipitate a confrontation when change in havana may be just around the corner .
back to top libya since the dark days of the 1988 lockerbie bombing - for which a libyan agent was convicted - this north african oil state has made huge strides towards being rehabilitated by the rest of the world .
it has renounced terrorism , agreed to pay compensation to the victims ' families and is rejoicing in the lifting of un sanctions .
most dramatically , libya has announced that it is abandoning its programmes for developing weapons of mass destruction .
it has agreed to the immediate international monitoring of its facilities , and has also promised to negotiate a new deal with the united nation 's nuclear agency and to provide guarantees on biological weapons .
libya 's leader , colonel muammar gaddafi , is not the firebrand revolutionary he once portrayed himself as .
thirty-four years in power and a bruising airstrike by the us air force on his tripoli house in 1986 have mellowed him .
pragmatists around him have convinced him that he needs a working relationship with the west if the country is to advance economically .
most analysts no longer consider libya to be a threat .

it has already tested its missiles over the northern pacific and it has been an avid exporter of missile technology to the volatile middle east .
scud-type missiles deployed by iran , iraq , syria and other countries are nearly all derived from north korean know-how .
pakistan denies the suggestion that it traded its nuclear weapons expertise for north korean missile technology .
there are many who would argue that north korea 's dangerous and unpredictable regime was a far more worthy candidate for replacement than that of saddam hussein 's in iraq .
but there is a compelling reason why the us is reluctant to get into a military confrontation with north korea .
even without a nuclear bomb , kim jong-il could retaliate with enough missiles , field artillery and chemical weapons to flatten the nearby south korean capital , seoul .
casualties would also be high amongst the 37,000 us troops based in south korea , while the economic impact on neighbouring countries such as japan could be catastrophic .
hence nobody in the region - except possibly elements of the north korean leadership - wants to see a conflict .
back to top cuba of all the countries on the us list of so-called " rogue states " , the case is the weakest for cuba .
like libya , it has been ruled for decades by a now-ageing revolutionary who is tiring of the economic penalties that come with being treated as a pariah by washington .
fidel castro is certainly no democrat and president bush would dearly love to see him replaced by someone more amenable to the us .
but the accusation made last year by the us undersecretary of state john bolton that cuba had a biological weapons programme was widely derided .
his boss , us secretary of state colin powell , was obliged to clarify the us position , saying he did not believe cuba had bio-weapons , merely the capability to conduct biological research for offensive purposes - a charge that could be levelled at scores of countries around the world .
in military terms cuba presents little threat to anyone .
although during the cold war it sent troops to angola , these days its armed forces are withering through underfunding .
the collapse of its former benefactor , the soviet union , has deprived its once powerful air force of spare parts .
at just 60,000 troops , its army has shrunk to less than a third of the size it was 10 years ago .
fidel castro is now approaching his 80th birthday .
the us is unlikely to want to precipitate a confrontation when change in havana may be just around the corner .
back to top libya since the dark days of the 1988 lockerbie bombing - for which a libyan agent was convicted - this north african oil state has made huge strides towards being rehabilitated by the rest of the world .
it has renounced terrorism , agreed to pay compensation to the victims ' families and is rejoicing in the lifting of un sanctions .
most dramatically , libya has announced that it is abandoning its programmes for developing weapons of mass destruction .
it has agreed to the immediate international monitoring of its facilities , and has also promised to negotiate a new deal with the united nation 's nuclear agency and to provide guarantees on biological weapons .
libya 's leader , colonel muammar gaddafi , is not the firebrand revolutionary he once portrayed himself as .
thirty-four years in power and a bruising airstrike by the us air force on his tripoli house in 1986 have mellowed him .
pragmatists around him have convinced him that he needs a working relationship with the west if the country is to advance economically .
most analysts no longer consider libya to be a threat .

us undersecretary of state john bolton has said that syria , libya and cuba are also candidates .
so what is the us case against these countries and what are its options now ?
syria the us state department accuses syria of supporting terrorism and harbouring palestinian groups it classes as terrorists .
the us has also accused syria of playing an unhelpful role during and after the war in iraq , allowing large numbers of armed volunteers to cross its borders to fight against the us-led coalition in iraq .
syria denies it supports terrorists and denies any suggestions that it has given shelter to senior members of ousted iraqi president saddam hussein 's former regime .
the official view in damascus - which is shared by much of the arab world - is that palestinian resistance groups are not terrorists but " freedom fighters " who have a legitimate right to resist israeli occupation of arab land .
to punish syria , a us congressional committee has proposed introducing sanctions , with a bill that accuses syria of sponsoring terrorists , occupying lebanon with more than 20,000 troops and trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- .
washington needs syria , but the question is how much ?
there can never be a comprehensive arab-israeli peace deal without syria 's signature but negotiations have all but ceased .
since the 11 september 2001 attacks , however , washington has found syria to be a useful partner in combating osama bin laden 's al-qaeda .
damascus shares some intelligence with the cia and is known to have passed on the results of at least one interrogation , that of mohammed haydar zammar , a man accused of having links with al-qaeda .
if it ever came to conflict in the future , syria 's armed forces would be no match for those of either israel or the pentagon .
its large and undoubtedly tough army relies on equipment that is often more than 30 years old .
the air force is incapable of effectively defending syrian airspace and its navy poses little threat to anyone .
however , syria does have a number of medium and long-range surface-to-surface missiles .
israel says it believes these missiles can be armed with both chemical and biological weapons - if that assessment is correct then this would be a powerful deterrent to any full scale military attack .
back to top iran iran 's nuclear programme is worrying almost everyone now , not just the us , which has long classed the islamic republic as " a state sponsor of terrorism " .
tehran insists its nuclear ambitions are purely civilian and that it has the right to develop its own home-grown energy programme .
but inspectors from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , have discovered suspicious traces of enriched uranium at sites in iran .
so washington believes , as do several countries , that iran is only a few years away from building a nuclear bomb .
since the us also accuses iran of supporting terrorists and obstructing peace in the middle east , it is clearly worried by the situation .
on 9 october us undersecretary of state john bolton - a noted hawk in the administration - said : " the risk of outward iranian proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to other countries in the region is -lsb- also -rsb- a risk we take very seriously . "
america 's options in iran are limited .
the west has very limited influence over the people who take the decisions there regarding national security - they are mostly hardliners opposed to the us .
for now , hope rests with the un 's nuclear inspectors .
but if iran fails to give them full access then , over time , other countries in the region - such as saudi arabia - may be tempted to try to acquire their own nuclear deterrents , thereby setting off a middle east arms race .
if iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , the country with most to fear would be israel .
the last time a country in the region appeared to begin work on such weapons the israelis carried out a pre-emptive strike .
in 1981 the israeli air force raided and destroyed iraq 's french-built osirak nuclear reactor .
there was widespread outrage , but it set back saddam hussein 's nuclear ambitions by nearly 20 years .
israel has not ruled out doing the same with iran .
back to top iraq with the defeat of saddam hussein 's regime in baghdad , iraq 's alleged wmd capability has turned out to be far less fearsome than we were led to believe .
at the time of writing , no actual wmd have been found , despite months of searching by the coalition 's 1200-strong iraq survey group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
that group 's interim report has been seized on by critics as proof the iraqi threat was grossly exaggerated .
however , the report does detail extensive evidence that saddam hussein had not given up his ambitions to develop wmd .
so the isg report has equally been seized on by the us and british governments as a vindication that the former iraqi leader was an international menace who needed to be disarmed .
the troubling question is this .
if those lethal weapons really did exist at the outbreak of war in march 2003 , then where are they now ?
the nightmare for the west , however improbable , is that iraq 's alleged chemical and biological weapons could fall into the hands of unscrupulous terrorists linked to or inspired by al-qaeda .
back to top north korea this is the hardest case of all .
the isolated , bankrupt and almost impenetrable communist state of kim jong-il has hinted that it may already be in a position to build several nuclear bombs .
in october 2002 , us satellite reconnaissance revealed north korea was secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in contravention of a deal made with the clinton administration .
faced with the evidence , the north koreans did not deny it .
they then expelled the un 's nuclear inspectors and withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
us undersecretary of state john bolton has described the ruler , kim jong-il , as " a dictator " .
in return , north korea called him " human scum " .
regional talks mediated by china have so far failed to resolve the issue of the nuclear programme .
but there are also concerns over north korea 's long-range missile programme .
it has already tested its missiles over the northern pacific and it has been an avid exporter of missile technology to the volatile middle east .

his boss , us secretary of state colin powell , was obliged to clarify the us position , saying he did not believe cuba had bio-weapons , merely the capability to conduct biological research for offensive purposes - a charge that could be levelled at scores of countries around the world .
in military terms cuba presents little threat to anyone .
although during the cold war it sent troops to angola , these days its armed forces are withering through underfunding .
the collapse of its former benefactor , the soviet union , has deprived its once powerful air force of spare parts .
at just 60,000 troops , its army has shrunk to less than a third of the size it was 10 years ago .
fidel castro is now approaching his 80th birthday .
the us is unlikely to want to precipitate a confrontation when change in havana may be just around the corner .
back to top libya since the dark days of the 1988 lockerbie bombing - for which a libyan agent was convicted - this north african oil state has made huge strides towards being rehabilitated by the rest of the world .
it has renounced terrorism , agreed to pay compensation to the victims ' families and is rejoicing in the lifting of un sanctions .
most dramatically , libya has announced that it is abandoning its programmes for developing weapons of mass destruction .
it has agreed to the immediate international monitoring of its facilities , and has also promised to negotiate a new deal with the united nation 's nuclear agency and to provide guarantees on biological weapons .
libya 's leader , colonel muammar gaddafi , is not the firebrand revolutionary he once portrayed himself as .
thirty-four years in power and a bruising airstrike by the us air force on his tripoli house in 1986 have mellowed him .
pragmatists around him have convinced him that he needs a working relationship with the west if the country is to advance economically .
most analysts no longer consider libya to be a threat .

us undersecretary of state john bolton has said that syria , libya and cuba are also candidates .
so what is the us case against these countries and what are its options now ?
syria the us state department accuses syria of supporting terrorism and harbouring palestinian groups it classes as terrorists .
the us has also accused syria of playing an unhelpful role during and after the war in iraq , allowing large numbers of armed volunteers to cross its borders to fight against the us-led coalition in iraq .
syria denies it supports terrorists and denies any suggestions that it has given shelter to senior members of ousted iraqi president saddam hussein 's former regime .
the official view in damascus - which is shared by much of the arab world - is that palestinian resistance groups are not terrorists but " freedom fighters " who have a legitimate right to resist israeli occupation of arab land .
to punish syria , a us congressional committee has proposed introducing sanctions , with a bill that accuses syria of sponsoring terrorists , occupying lebanon with more than 20,000 troops and trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- .
washington needs syria , but the question is how much ?
there can never be a comprehensive arab-israeli peace deal without syria 's signature but negotiations have all but ceased .
since the 11 september 2001 attacks , however , washington has found syria to be a useful partner in combating osama bin laden 's al-qaeda .
damascus shares some intelligence with the cia and is known to have passed on the results of at least one interrogation , that of mohammed haydar zammar , a man accused of having links with al-qaeda .
if it ever came to conflict in the future , syria 's armed forces would be no match for those of either israel or the pentagon .
its large and undoubtedly tough army relies on equipment that is often more than 30 years old .
the air force is incapable of effectively defending syrian airspace and its navy poses little threat to anyone .
however , syria does have a number of medium and long-range surface-to-surface missiles .
israel says it believes these missiles can be armed with both chemical and biological weapons - if that assessment is correct then this would be a powerful deterrent to any full scale military attack .
back to top iran iran 's nuclear programme is worrying almost everyone now , not just the us , which has long classed the islamic republic as " a state sponsor of terrorism " .
tehran insists its nuclear ambitions are purely civilian and that it has the right to develop its own home-grown energy programme .
but inspectors from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , have discovered suspicious traces of enriched uranium at sites in iran .
so washington believes , as do several countries , that iran is only a few years away from building a nuclear bomb .
since the us also accuses iran of supporting terrorists and obstructing peace in the middle east , it is clearly worried by the situation .
on 9 october us undersecretary of state john bolton - a noted hawk in the administration - said : " the risk of outward iranian proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to other countries in the region is -lsb- also -rsb- a risk we take very seriously . "
america 's options in iran are limited .
the west has very limited influence over the people who take the decisions there regarding national security - they are mostly hardliners opposed to the us .
for now , hope rests with the un 's nuclear inspectors .
but if iran fails to give them full access then , over time , other countries in the region - such as saudi arabia - may be tempted to try to acquire their own nuclear deterrents , thereby setting off a middle east arms race .
if iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , the country with most to fear would be israel .
the last time a country in the region appeared to begin work on such weapons the israelis carried out a pre-emptive strike .
in 1981 the israeli air force raided and destroyed iraq 's french-built osirak nuclear reactor .
there was widespread outrage , but it set back saddam hussein 's nuclear ambitions by nearly 20 years .
israel has not ruled out doing the same with iran .
back to top iraq with the defeat of saddam hussein 's regime in baghdad , iraq 's alleged wmd capability has turned out to be far less fearsome than we were led to believe .
at the time of writing , no actual wmd have been found , despite months of searching by the coalition 's 1200-strong iraq survey group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
that group 's interim report has been seized on by critics as proof the iraqi threat was grossly exaggerated .
however , the report does detail extensive evidence that saddam hussein had not given up his ambitions to develop wmd .
so the isg report has equally been seized on by the us and british governments as a vindication that the former iraqi leader was an international menace who needed to be disarmed .
the troubling question is this .
if those lethal weapons really did exist at the outbreak of war in march 2003 , then where are they now ?
the nightmare for the west , however improbable , is that iraq 's alleged chemical and biological weapons could fall into the hands of unscrupulous terrorists linked to or inspired by al-qaeda .
back to top north korea this is the hardest case of all .
the isolated , bankrupt and almost impenetrable communist state of kim jong-il has hinted that it may already be in a position to build several nuclear bombs .
in october 2002 , us satellite reconnaissance revealed north korea was secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in contravention of a deal made with the clinton administration .
faced with the evidence , the north koreans did not deny it .
they then expelled the un 's nuclear inspectors and withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
us undersecretary of state john bolton has described the ruler , kim jong-il , as " a dictator " .
in return , north korea called him " human scum " .
regional talks mediated by china have so far failed to resolve the issue of the nuclear programme .
but there are also concerns over north korea 's long-range missile programme .
it has already tested its missiles over the northern pacific and it has been an avid exporter of missile technology to the volatile middle east .
scud-type missiles deployed by iran , iraq , syria and other countries are nearly all derived from north korean know-how .
pakistan denies the suggestion that it traded its nuclear weapons expertise for north korean missile technology .
there are many who would argue that north korea 's dangerous and unpredictable regime was a far more worthy candidate for replacement than that of saddam hussein 's in iraq .
but there is a compelling reason why the us is reluctant to get into a military confrontation with north korea .
even without a nuclear bomb , kim jong-il could retaliate with enough missiles , field artillery and chemical weapons to flatten the nearby south korean capital , seoul .
casualties would also be high amongst the 37,000 us troops based in south korea , while the economic impact on neighbouring countries such as japan could be catastrophic .
hence nobody in the region - except possibly elements of the north korean leadership - wants to see a conflict .
back to top cuba of all the countries on the us list of so-called " rogue states " , the case is the weakest for cuba .
like libya , it has been ruled for decades by a now-ageing revolutionary who is tiring of the economic penalties that come with being treated as a pariah by washington .
fidel castro is certainly no democrat and president bush would dearly love to see him replaced by someone more amenable to the us .
but the accusation made last year by the us undersecretary of state john bolton that cuba had a biological weapons programme was widely derided .
his boss , us secretary of state colin powell , was obliged to clarify the us position , saying he did not believe cuba had bio-weapons , merely the capability to conduct biological research for offensive purposes - a charge that could be levelled at scores of countries around the world .

us undersecretary of state john bolton has said that syria , libya and cuba are also candidates .
so what is the us case against these countries and what are its options now ?
syria the us state department accuses syria of supporting terrorism and harbouring palestinian groups it classes as terrorists .
the us has also accused syria of playing an unhelpful role during and after the war in iraq , allowing large numbers of armed volunteers to cross its borders to fight against the us-led coalition in iraq .
syria denies it supports terrorists and denies any suggestions that it has given shelter to senior members of ousted iraqi president saddam hussein 's former regime .
the official view in damascus - which is shared by much of the arab world - is that palestinian resistance groups are not terrorists but " freedom fighters " who have a legitimate right to resist israeli occupation of arab land .
to punish syria , a us congressional committee has proposed introducing sanctions , with a bill that accuses syria of sponsoring terrorists , occupying lebanon with more than 20,000 troops and trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmd -rrb- .
washington needs syria , but the question is how much ?
there can never be a comprehensive arab-israeli peace deal without syria 's signature but negotiations have all but ceased .
since the 11 september 2001 attacks , however , washington has found syria to be a useful partner in combating osama bin laden 's al-qaeda .
damascus shares some intelligence with the cia and is known to have passed on the results of at least one interrogation , that of mohammed haydar zammar , a man accused of having links with al-qaeda .
if it ever came to conflict in the future , syria 's armed forces would be no match for those of either israel or the pentagon .
its large and undoubtedly tough army relies on equipment that is often more than 30 years old .
the air force is incapable of effectively defending syrian airspace and its navy poses little threat to anyone .
however , syria does have a number of medium and long-range surface-to-surface missiles .
israel says it believes these missiles can be armed with both chemical and biological weapons - if that assessment is correct then this would be a powerful deterrent to any full scale military attack .
back to top iran iran 's nuclear programme is worrying almost everyone now , not just the us , which has long classed the islamic republic as " a state sponsor of terrorism " .
tehran insists its nuclear ambitions are purely civilian and that it has the right to develop its own home-grown energy programme .
but inspectors from the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , have discovered suspicious traces of enriched uranium at sites in iran .
so washington believes , as do several countries , that iran is only a few years away from building a nuclear bomb .
since the us also accuses iran of supporting terrorists and obstructing peace in the middle east , it is clearly worried by the situation .
on 9 october us undersecretary of state john bolton - a noted hawk in the administration - said : " the risk of outward iranian proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to other countries in the region is -lsb- also -rsb- a risk we take very seriously . "
america 's options in iran are limited .
the west has very limited influence over the people who take the decisions there regarding national security - they are mostly hardliners opposed to the us .
for now , hope rests with the un 's nuclear inspectors .
but if iran fails to give them full access then , over time , other countries in the region - such as saudi arabia - may be tempted to try to acquire their own nuclear deterrents , thereby setting off a middle east arms race .
if iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , the country with most to fear would be israel .
the last time a country in the region appeared to begin work on such weapons the israelis carried out a pre-emptive strike .
in 1981 the israeli air force raided and destroyed iraq 's french-built osirak nuclear reactor .
there was widespread outrage , but it set back saddam hussein 's nuclear ambitions by nearly 20 years .
israel has not ruled out doing the same with iran .
back to top iraq with the defeat of saddam hussein 's regime in baghdad , iraq 's alleged wmd capability has turned out to be far less fearsome than we were led to believe .
at the time of writing , no actual wmd have been found , despite months of searching by the coalition 's 1200-strong iraq survey group -lrb- isg -rrb- .
that group 's interim report has been seized on by critics as proof the iraqi threat was grossly exaggerated .
however , the report does detail extensive evidence that saddam hussein had not given up his ambitions to develop wmd .
so the isg report has equally been seized on by the us and british governments as a vindication that the former iraqi leader was an international menace who needed to be disarmed .
the troubling question is this .
if those lethal weapons really did exist at the outbreak of war in march 2003 , then where are they now ?
the nightmare for the west , however improbable , is that iraq 's alleged chemical and biological weapons could fall into the hands of unscrupulous terrorists linked to or inspired by al-qaeda .
back to top north korea this is the hardest case of all .
the isolated , bankrupt and almost impenetrable communist state of kim jong-il has hinted that it may already be in a position to build several nuclear bombs .
in october 2002 , us satellite reconnaissance revealed north korea was secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in contravention of a deal made with the clinton administration .
faced with the evidence , the north koreans did not deny it .
they then expelled the un 's nuclear inspectors and withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
us undersecretary of state john bolton has described the ruler , kim jong-il , as " a dictator " .
in return , north korea called him " human scum " .
regional talks mediated by china have so far failed to resolve the issue of the nuclear programme .
but there are also concerns over north korea 's long-range missile programme .
it has already tested its missiles over the northern pacific and it has been an avid exporter of missile technology to the volatile middle east .
scud-type missiles deployed by iran , iraq , syria and other countries are nearly all derived from north korean know-how .
pakistan denies the suggestion that it traded its nuclear weapons expertise for north korean missile technology .
there are many who would argue that north korea 's dangerous and unpredictable regime was a far more worthy candidate for replacement than that of saddam hussein 's in iraq .
but there is a compelling reason why the us is reluctant to get into a military confrontation with north korea .
even without a nuclear bomb , kim jong-il could retaliate with enough missiles , field artillery and chemical weapons to flatten the nearby south korean capital , seoul .
casualties would also be high amongst the 37,000 us troops based in south korea , while the economic impact on neighbouring countries such as japan could be catastrophic .
hence nobody in the region - except possibly elements of the north korean leadership - wants to see a conflict .
back to top cuba of all the countries on the us list of so-called " rogue states " , the case is the weakest for cuba .
like libya , it has been ruled for decades by a now-ageing revolutionary who is tiring of the economic penalties that come with being treated as a pariah by washington .
fidel castro is certainly no democrat and president bush would dearly love to see him replaced by someone more amenable to the us .
but the accusation made last year by the us undersecretary of state john bolton that cuba had a biological weapons programme was widely derided .
his boss , us secretary of state colin powell , was obliged to clarify the us position , saying he did not believe cuba had bio-weapons , merely the capability to conduct biological research for offensive purposes - a charge that could be levelled at scores of countries around the world .
in military terms cuba presents little threat to anyone .
although during the cold war it sent troops to angola , these days its armed forces are withering through underfunding .
the collapse of its former benefactor , the soviet union , has deprived its once powerful air force of spare parts .
at just 60,000 troops , its army has shrunk to less than a third of the size it was 10 years ago .
fidel castro is now approaching his 80th birthday .
the us is unlikely to want to precipitate a confrontation when change in havana may be just around the corner .
back to top libya since the dark days of the 1988 lockerbie bombing - for which a libyan agent was convicted - this north african oil state has made huge strides towards being rehabilitated by the rest of the world .
it has renounced terrorism , agreed to pay compensation to the victims ' families and is rejoicing in the lifting of un sanctions .
most dramatically , libya has announced that it is abandoning its programmes for developing weapons of mass destruction .
it has agreed to the immediate international monitoring of its facilities , and has also promised to negotiate a new deal with the united nation 's nuclear agency and to provide guarantees on biological weapons .
libya 's leader , colonel muammar gaddafi , is not the firebrand revolutionary he once portrayed himself as .
