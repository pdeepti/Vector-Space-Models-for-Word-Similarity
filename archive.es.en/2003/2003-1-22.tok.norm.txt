under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .
-lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- minister threatens to fine doctors the german health ministry declared wednesday ´ s action as illegal .
a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .
2 .
the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .
schmidt wants to introduce more competition into the health care system , specifically breaking the monopoly held by the association of statutory health insurance physicians on contract negotiations with the insurers .
critics claim the system encourages doctors to prescribe costly and unnecessary treatments because payment is dependent on the treatment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unhealthy times for german health system health minister ulla schmidt is heading for a confrontation with doctors ' associations over her austerity plans aimed at cutting spiraling costs .

the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .

in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .

a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2003 german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to make it easier for german companies to terminate employees the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its " alliance for jobs " initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions . germany 's " super minister " for economics and labor , wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , has sparked a war of words - even within his own party - by suggesting the country 's strict labor laws be eased in order to encourage german companies to hire more workers .
under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .
-lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- minister threatens to fine doctors the german health ministry declared wednesday ´ s action as illegal .
a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .
2 .
the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .
schmidt wants to introduce more competition into the health care system , specifically breaking the monopoly held by the association of statutory health insurance physicians on contract negotiations with the insurers .
critics claim the system encourages doctors to prescribe costly and unnecessary treatments because payment is dependent on the treatment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unhealthy times for german health system health minister ulla schmidt is heading for a confrontation with doctors ' associations over her austerity plans aimed at cutting spiraling costs .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2003 german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to make it easier for german companies to terminate employees the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its " alliance for jobs " initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions . germany 's " super minister " for economics and labor , wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , has sparked a war of words - even within his own party - by suggesting the country 's strict labor laws be eased in order to encourage german companies to hire more workers .
under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .

in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

as dutch voters head to the polls on wednesday , nearly all the political parties have pandered to the legacy of pim fortuyn , the right-wing populist politician assassinated last may . just eight months since the last parliamentary elections the dutch are going to the polls to vote for a new government .
the campaigns have shown that nearly all the parties fielding candidates have learned lessons from pim fortuyn -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , the rising comet of dutch politics during the last elections who was assassinated by an animal rights activist just a week before the vote in may 2002 .
the run up to the election has been dominated by the issues the populist fortuyn focused on : immigration , integration and crime . singing a different song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * file * * dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn during an interview in this april 8 , 2002 file photo .

-lrb- ap photo / bas czerwinski -rrb- even the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , which suffered its worst election defeat since world war ii last may , has changed its tone under the leadership of its new and charismatic leader , 39-year-old wouter bos .
the pvda is now calling for stricter immigration regulations and strengthening the fight against crime , an about-turn according to dutch political commentators . it appears that bos ' strategy will pay off on wednesday .
pollsters predict that the labor party will regain around 13 of the 22 mandates it lost last time around , going from 23 to 40 or 41 seats in the 150-seat dutch parliament , culling them from pim fortuyn 's party -lrb- lpf -rrb- . populism appeals bos is not alone in catering to populist sentiments .
prime minister jan peter balkenende 's christian democrats -lrb- cda -rrb- and the liberal party -lrb- vvd -rrb- , one of the cda 's governing coalition partners , have even tried to undermine dutch taboos , saying , for example , that the dutch should be forced to carry personal identification at all times and that minors too should be subjected to strip searches when suspected of crimes . the cda is expected to poll the same or slightly more than labor , while the vvd is pegged to receive 27 or 28 mandates .
that wo n't be enough to allow the cda and vvd to rule with a clear majority - a total of ten parties currently sit in the dutch parliament .
a cda-pvda coalition could be the outcome . in the meantime , fortuyn 's lpf , which went from zero to 26 mandates last election and became the second strongest parliamentary power , is expected to practically disappear with a meager six parliamentary seats . volatile dutch voting habits dutch pollsters , however , are n't banking on their prognoses , since one-quarter of dutch voters still have n't decided how to cast their votes . after 87 days in office , prime minister balkenende dissolved the previous government in october , an unstable coalition of the christian democrats , the liberal party and fortuyn 's party , following the resignation of two lpf ministers over an internal party dispute . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch coalition government resigns after three months after just three months in office , the dutch coalition government collapsed on wednesday amid tales of in-fighting between members of murdered populist politician pim fortuyn 's lpf party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2003 german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to make it easier for german companies to terminate employees the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its " alliance for jobs " initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions . germany 's " super minister " for economics and labor , wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , has sparked a war of words - even within his own party - by suggesting the country 's strict labor laws be eased in order to encourage german companies to hire more workers .
under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .

health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2003 german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to make it easier for german companies to terminate employees the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its " alliance for jobs " initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions . germany 's " super minister " for economics and labor , wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , has sparked a war of words - even within his own party - by suggesting the country 's strict labor laws be eased in order to encourage german companies to hire more workers .
under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

as dutch voters head to the polls on wednesday , nearly all the political parties have pandered to the legacy of pim fortuyn , the right-wing populist politician assassinated last may . just eight months since the last parliamentary elections the dutch are going to the polls to vote for a new government .
the campaigns have shown that nearly all the parties fielding candidates have learned lessons from pim fortuyn -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , the rising comet of dutch politics during the last elections who was assassinated by an animal rights activist just a week before the vote in may 2002 .
the run up to the election has been dominated by the issues the populist fortuyn focused on : immigration , integration and crime . singing a different song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * file * * dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn during an interview in this april 8 , 2002 file photo .
the animal rights activist volker van der graaf charged with murdering fortuyn in may 2002 , broke his seven-month silence and confessed the shooting , saying he thought the populist politician was a danger to society , dutch prosecutors said saturday , nov .
23 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / bas czerwinski -rrb- even the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , which suffered its worst election defeat since world war ii last may , has changed its tone under the leadership of its new and charismatic leader , 39-year-old wouter bos .
the pvda is now calling for stricter immigration regulations and strengthening the fight against crime , an about-turn according to dutch political commentators . it appears that bos ' strategy will pay off on wednesday .
pollsters predict that the labor party will regain around 13 of the 22 mandates it lost last time around , going from 23 to 40 or 41 seats in the 150-seat dutch parliament , culling them from pim fortuyn 's party -lrb- lpf -rrb- . populism appeals bos is not alone in catering to populist sentiments .
prime minister jan peter balkenende 's christian democrats -lrb- cda -rrb- and the liberal party -lrb- vvd -rrb- , one of the cda 's governing coalition partners , have even tried to undermine dutch taboos , saying , for example , that the dutch should be forced to carry personal identification at all times and that minors too should be subjected to strip searches when suspected of crimes . the cda is expected to poll the same or slightly more than labor , while the vvd is pegged to receive 27 or 28 mandates .
that wo n't be enough to allow the cda and vvd to rule with a clear majority - a total of ten parties currently sit in the dutch parliament .
a cda-pvda coalition could be the outcome . in the meantime , fortuyn 's lpf , which went from zero to 26 mandates last election and became the second strongest parliamentary power , is expected to practically disappear with a meager six parliamentary seats . volatile dutch voting habits dutch pollsters , however , are n't banking on their prognoses , since one-quarter of dutch voters still have n't decided how to cast their votes . after 87 days in office , prime minister balkenende dissolved the previous government in october , an unstable coalition of the christian democrats , the liberal party and fortuyn 's party , following the resignation of two lpf ministers over an internal party dispute . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch coalition government resigns after three months after just three months in office , the dutch coalition government collapsed on wednesday amid tales of in-fighting between members of murdered populist politician pim fortuyn 's lpf party .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .

a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .

the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.01.2003 culture clash on german burial ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish cemetery in berlin is one of the few in germany offering traditional muslim burials .
around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.01.2003 culture clash on german burial ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish cemetery in berlin is one of the few in germany offering traditional muslim burials .
around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live hin & weg we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2003 german labor minister wants to make firing and hiring easier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to make it easier for german companies to terminate employees the german government is seeking to revive its effort to work with unions and employers in its " alliance for jobs " initiative to spur employment , but a proposal to make layoffs easier is facing opposition from unions . germany 's " super minister " for economics and labor , wolfgang clement of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , has sparked a war of words - even within his own party - by suggesting the country 's strict labor laws be eased in order to encourage german companies to hire more workers .
under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .
the group has discussed everything from wage negotiations to projects to spur job growth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .
the top-level roundtable group first convened in 1998 and has brought together employer associations , the government and trade unions .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .
-lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- minister threatens to fine doctors the german health ministry declared wednesday ´ s action as illegal .
a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .

the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .
schmidt wants to introduce more competition into the health care system , specifically breaking the monopoly held by the association of statutory health insurance physicians on contract negotiations with the insurers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.01.2003 culture clash on german burial ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish cemetery in berlin is one of the few in germany offering traditional muslim burials .
around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

as dutch voters head to the polls on wednesday , nearly all the political parties have pandered to the legacy of pim fortuyn , the right-wing populist politician assassinated last may . just eight months since the last parliamentary elections the dutch are going to the polls to vote for a new government .
the campaigns have shown that nearly all the parties fielding candidates have learned lessons from pim fortuyn -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , the rising comet of dutch politics during the last elections who was assassinated by an animal rights activist just a week before the vote in may 2002 .
the run up to the election has been dominated by the issues the populist fortuyn focused on : immigration , integration and crime . singing a different song bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * file * * dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn during an interview in this april 8 , 2002 file photo .
the animal rights activist volker van der graaf charged with murdering fortuyn in may 2002 , broke his seven-month silence and confessed the shooting , saying he thought the populist politician was a danger to society , dutch prosecutors said saturday , nov .
23 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / bas czerwinski -rrb- even the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , which suffered its worst election defeat since world war ii last may , has changed its tone under the leadership of its new and charismatic leader , 39-year-old wouter bos .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .
-lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- minister threatens to fine doctors the german health ministry declared wednesday ´ s action as illegal .
a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .
2 .
the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .
schmidt wants to introduce more competition into the health care system , specifically breaking the monopoly held by the association of statutory health insurance physicians on contract negotiations with the insurers .
critics claim the system encourages doctors to prescribe costly and unnecessary treatments because payment is dependent on the treatment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unhealthy times for german health system health minister ulla schmidt is heading for a confrontation with doctors ' associations over her austerity plans aimed at cutting spiraling costs .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .
however , doctors have assured patients in the german capital that a system will be put in place ensuring that patients will be able to find a doctor within a radius of two kilometers .
-lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- minister threatens to fine doctors the german health ministry declared wednesday ´ s action as illegal .
a spokesman , klaus theo schröder , urged patients to report striking doctors to their health insurer , and the health minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia , birgit fischer , threatened to fine doctors who went on strike because they had broken their contracts .
schmidt plans to release her plans to overhaul germany ’ s ailing health care system after elections are held in two german states on feb .
2 .
the system is drowning under spiraling costs and in december schmidt was forced to concede that the deficit of the public health insurers would hit € 2.5 billion -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- for 2002 .
schmidt wants to introduce more competition into the health care system , specifically breaking the monopoly held by the association of statutory health insurance physicians on contract negotiations with the insurers .
critics claim the system encourages doctors to prescribe costly and unnecessary treatments because payment is dependent on the treatment . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unhealthy times for german health system health minister ulla schmidt is heading for a confrontation with doctors ' associations over her austerity plans aimed at cutting spiraling costs .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

under current german law , it is difficult for companies with more than five employees to terminate workers - especially those who are married or have children .
terminations are regulated by a series of complicated rules that discourage companies from paring staff , even in times of economic uncertainty .
but clement now says job protection should be weakened in larger firms , too .
" the rigid number limit is a problem , " he said .
" we need a solution .
above all we do hangs this question - how do we create jobs ? "
on friday , clement proposed that worker protection should only be give to one out of two employees for companies with more than five workers .
under the former conservative government of chancellor helmut kohl , the worker protection law was loosened in 1996 for companies with up to 10 employees , but schröder 's government campaigned on the issue and reduced the exclusion to five employees after its election in 1998 .
an obstacle for job growth ?
many employers agree with the need to change the law , saying that a company that can fire more easily will be quicker to hire .
" i think he has the right ideas , " said michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industries .
" from my talks with small and medium sized companies , i know that job protection legislation in its present form is an obstacle to boosting employment .
so i would welcome any success mr. clement has in pushing through his reforms .
but i fear he 'll face stiff resistance . "
and he has .
the trade unions , led by the powerful metalworkers , have expressed fierce opposition to clement .
the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer , described clement 's proposal as " half-baked " and expressed his oppositions to changes in the law .
he did say , however , his organization would be willing to work with german chancellor gerhard schröder 's " alliance for jobs " roundtable .
the head of powerful german construction industry union ig bau , klaus wiesehügel , offered more pointed criticism .
" i hope the spd has remained socially conscious enough to stop these abstruse proposals , " adding that clement 's statements led him to question the credibility of the social democrats ' political platforms .
the german employers ' association has also told schröder it 's is willing to take part in another alliance for jobs program - and they would like to place the issue of job protection at the top of the agenda .
" these are individual positions , and they belong in a debate within the alliance , " said chancellor schröder .
" but i 'd like to point out that it 's about how we create the security , under altered conditions , that employees need . "
on tuesday , the chancellor held talks with unions to discuss recommissioning the alliance for jobs .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws . four times a year , serdar demir and his colleagues at the turkish-islamic union burial service can be found at field 27 of cologne ’ s west cemetery , where they routinely service the site . taking care of the graves at the cemetery - which was set aside in the 1960 ’ s for the sole purpose of burying resident muslims in germany - is an important task for demir .
the split between german and muslim burial practices is great and demir spends a large part of his time organising funerals for resident german muslims in their islamic homeland . burial laws clash according to experts , around 95 per cent of the estimated 3,5 million muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil . these high figures are unsurprising : germany has some of the strictest burial laws , many of which clash with islamic burial rituals . muslims bury their dead as soon as possible : if a death occurs in the morning , the burial will take place that afternoon .
under german law , relatives of the deceased are required to wait 48 hours before a burial can take place and must bury their dead in a coffin – or if the corpse has been cremated – in an urn .
islamic ritual states that the body be buried wrapped simply in a shroud and laid with its face facing mecca . in addition , muslim tradition demands that muslims should also be buried with other muslims , stating that bodies should be given a eternal resting place .
this is another impossibility under current german burial law , which demands that remains be exhumed after between 15 and 30 years and that grave stones be removed after this period of time . court case ruling it was this rule that led to a group of muslims living in cologne to file a case against the city of cologne eight years ago , following news that 277 muslim graves at the city ’ s west cemetery were due to be exhumed . in a one-off ruling by the court , the muslims won an injunction against the city authorities and the graves remained untouched .
since then , they have remained that way . “ " somehow it was agreed that it would remain forever that way , ” says demir . special cemetary sites muslim communities are not allowed to operate their own cemeteries , since they do not have the required status of a public corperation .
however , many cities now have special cemetery sites set aside for muslims .
according to demir muslims nowadays living in germany are much better informed about the options open to them than a decade ago . german law regarding burial in coffins is on its way to becoming more relaxed : in some cemeteries , burial without a coffin is now possible .
in addition , muslims can now choose their own grave sites which will not be exhumed , providing they continue to pay to rent the site . but it is the cost of maintaining a grave which is the main reason why , according to demir , the number of muslims who choose to bury their dead on german soil is not expected to increase significantly . indeed , the cost of a flight back home and a funeral there is cheaper than a grave in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

doctors are striking across germany over propsed health care reform , and german officials are not happy about it . more than 6,000 german doctors held a one-day strike wednesday to protest a pending health-care reform that they say will hurt patients .
the strikers focused their protest on the northwestern area of westphalen-luppe , where an estimated 5,000 offices were closed .
other doctors protested in such places as stuttgart , bremen and the state of brandenburg ; near the capital of berlin .
the president of german medical association , jörg-dietrich hoppe , defended the action .
" we are protesting and demonstrating together with other health workers because we want to make it clear that the health care savings package will shift a massive burden onto the patients , " hoppe said .
health insurers facing huge deficits the health care reform being drawn up by health minister ulla schmidt has not been released yet .
but it will be designed to stop the huge deficits being run up by the country ´ s health insurers and prevent further increases in premiums that about 40 percent of people in germany ´ s public health insurance system will pay this year .
the doctors are also angry about the government ´ s decision to freeze their salaries this year as part of its efforts to control costs .
the freeze was the final straw peter orthen-rahner , head of a federation of 60,000 german doctors , told the reuters news agency on wednesday .
further protests are planned for next wednesday , when 20 percent of berlin ’ s 6,500 doctors in berlin will strike for the day .

this case will have a chilling effect on private communications , such as e-mail , surfing the internet or sending files between private parties verizon communications us district judge john bates said the company , verizon communications , must comply with a subpoena issued by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- .
the riaa 's president , cary sherman , said the ruling validated their decision to pursue individuals accused of illegal downloading under a 1998 digital-copyright law .
but verizon said it would appeal against the ruling , arguing that it violated privacy .
experts say that the ruling means that recording companies will be able to track down consumers using internet file-sharing programmes more easily , and press for civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution .
' legitimate alternatives ' the riaa used the digital millennium copyright act against the user , who allegedly downloaded more than 600 songs from the internet in one day .
cd copying , or burning , is an increasing ' threat ' to sales verizon argued that the law only applied to material stored on the company 's network , not files transmitted over it .
but the riaa successfully argued that the law applied to all the material either stored on or transmitted over internet providers ' networks .
" the illegal distribution of music on the internet is a serious issue for musicians , songwriters and other copyright holders , " riaa 's president said in a statement .
" the record companies have made great strides in addressing this problem by educating consumers and providing them with legitimate alternatives . "
' chilling effect ' verizon - who said it would not immediately identify the customer - said the ruling would have serious ramifications for the future growth of the internet .
" this case will have a chilling effect on private communications , such as e-mail , surfing the internet or sending files between private parties , " it said in a statement .
" verizon is not attempting to shield customers who break copyright laws .
" we are , however , seeking to protect the fundamental privacy and due process rights that should be afforded to our customers and all internet users . "
the music industry - whose total sales fell by 9 % last year to $ 30.3bn - is facing the huge problem of tracks being downloaded free of charge from the internet .
two years ago , firms succeeded in shutting down the free music website napster , but many similar sites have replaced it since . watch / listen on this story eric rabe , verison media relations " we only have the allegation that htis occurred in the first place . "

"
this case will have a chilling effect on private communications , such as e-mail , surfing the internet or sending files between private parties " verizon communications us district judge john bates said the company , verizon communications , must comply with a subpoena issued by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- .
the riaa 's president , cary sherman , said the ruling validated their decision to pursue individuals accused of illegal downloading under a 1998 digital-copyright law .
but verizon said it would appeal against the ruling , arguing that it violated privacy .
experts say that the ruling means that recording companies will be able to track down consumers using internet file-sharing programmes more easily , and press for civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution .
' legitimate alternatives ' the riaa used the digital millennium copyright act against the user , who allegedly downloaded more than 600 songs from the internet in one day .
verizon argued that the law only applied to material stored on the company 's network , not files transmitted over it .
but the riaa successfully argued that the law applied to all the material either stored on or transmitted over internet providers ' networks .
" the illegal distribution of music on the internet is a serious issue for musicians , songwriters and other copyright holders , " riaa 's president said in a statement .
" the record companies have made great strides in addressing this problem by educating consumers and providing them with legitimate alternatives . "
' chilling effect ' verizon - who said it would not immediately identify the customer - said the ruling would have serious ramifications for the future growth of the internet .
" this case will have a chilling effect on private communications , such as e-mail , surfing the internet or sending files between private parties , " it said in a statement .
" verizon is not attempting to shield customers who break copyright laws .
" we are , however , seeking to protect the fundamental privacy and due process rights that should be afforded to our customers and all internet users . "
the music industry - whose total sales fell by 9 % last year to $ 30.3bn - is facing the huge problem of tracks being downloaded free of charge from the internet .
two years ago , firms succeeded in shutting down the free music website napster , but many similar sites have replaced it since .

crisis chronology 16 oct : n korea acknowledges secret nuclear programme , us says 14 nov : oil shipments to n korea halted 22 dec : n korea removes monitoring devices at yongbyon nuclear plant 31 dec : un nuclear inspectors forced to leave north korea 10 jan : n korea pulls out of anti-nuclear treaty 11 jan : pyongyang suggests it could resume ballistic missile tests the statement came in ministerial talks between the two koreas in the southern capital , seoul - the highest level dialogue between them for three months .
a spokesman for the south korean delegation , rhee bong-jo , said the north had spelt out its position on the issue after seoul raised its concern during the first round of the talks .
" the south emphasized that overall inter-korean relations would be unable to move ahead without the nuclear question being resolved , " mr rhee said .
meanwhile , the us under secretary of state , john bolton , is shortly to meet the south korean foreign minister in seoul .
mr bolton is trying to get backing for washington 's view that the north korean nuclear crisis should be referred to the united nations security council .
north korea has been under increasing international pressure to reverse its decision to pull out of the nuclear arms control treaty and reactive a power station capable of producing weapons grade plutonium .
' reliable steps ' the four-day talks , which are the ninth round of discussions between the two sides since an historic summit in 2000 , were supposed to focus on reconciliation and a number of ongoing joint projects .
but seoul has appeared determined to take advantage of the meeting to press for the resolution of the nuclear stand-off .
" through this round of talks , we aim to persuade the north to take more concrete steps , " mr rhee said .
he said the talks could help create the conditions for a resumption of dialogue between pyongyang and washington .
" we urged them to take reliable steps the international community could accept , " mr rhee said .
north korea has so far resisted any intervention by other countries to defuse the nuclear crisis , calling it a bilateral issue between it and the us .
the united states has said that it is willing to sit down with pyongyang , but has made no plans to do so .
analysts believe the north may try to use the meeting to create a split between the south and its traditional ally , washington .
russian plan however , on tuesday , a russian envoy spoke optimistically of ending the stand-off .
russian deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , who held six hours of talks with north korean leader kim jong-il , said pyongyang responded " with interest " to a russian plan to defuse the crisis .
he told russia 's itar-tass news agency that the north korean leadership was currently considering moscow 's plan to end the impasse .
the russian plan reportedly envisages nuclear-free status for the korean peninsula , security guarantees for north korea , and a package of humanitarian and economic aid .
two other sets of inter-korean talks are also taking place this week .
one will focus on the reconnection of cross-border road and rail links .
the other , involving red cross officials , was expected to set a new date for another round of reunions between relatives from the two koreas who have been separated since both countries went to war half a century ago .
but those discussions are reported to have stalled due to a dispute over the size for a proposed venue for the reunions .

the move did not surprise analysts , who said it was unlikely the outgoing boj governor masaru hayami would make any radical change in policy in his final days in the post .
mr hayami 's five year term ends in march but the prime minister junichiro koizumi has not yet revealed his choice for a new governor .
the central bank said board members voted unanimously to target reserves in the bank 's current account at between 15 trillion and 20 trillion yen -lrb- $ 127bn - $ 169.5bn -rrb- .
more action needed ?
the bank said in a statement on wednesday : " should there be a risk of financial market instability , such as a surge in liquidity demand , the bank will provide more liquidity irrespective of the above target . "
the boj has provided the money market with excess funds and kept interest rates at virtually zero for the past 22 months under its ' quantitive zero ' policy .
but it has been criticised for not doing enough to end deflation .
just before its latest decision , the prime minister told the upper house of parliament : " we hope that the boj will adopt a more effective monetary policy . "
' smokescreen ' mr koizumi also said he hoped the new boj governor should be a strong fighter against deflation .
the long-running debate over whether the central bank should introduce an inflation target to fight falling prices in japan continued on wednesday .
government pressure is mounting on the boj to adopt the target as a way of boosting the economy and cushion the impact of the government attempts to wipe out the banking sector 's bad loans .
but a number of economists say the government is using the debate to act as a smokescreen .
" i think the debates are being used as a political tool to divert the public 's attention from the slow pace of reforms , " said masaaki kanno , chief economist at jp morgan .
" -lrb- politicians -rrb- are trying to dump everything in the lap of the boj .
" they must discuss ways to really fight deflation .
it appears the debates over inflation targeting are done for the sake of argument , " added mr kanno .

the vehicle , driven by a south korean national , killed a 45-year-old woman near the city of inchon .
police said the woman had a hearing impairment , south korea 's yonhap news agency said .
the accident comes at a time of acute sensitivities over the presence of 37,000 us troops in south korea , stationed there to counter the threat from the stalinist north .
activists said the accident was unlikely to spark complaints .
there have been regular protests against the laws governing their presence since a us court martial last year acquitted two us soldiers over another road accident .

the vehicle , driven by a south korean national , killed a 45-year-old woman near the city of inchon .
anti-us sentiment is running high in seoul police said the woman had a hearing impairment , south korea 's yonhap news agency said .
the accident comes at a time of acute sensitivities over the presence of 37,000 us troops in south korea , stationed there to counter the threat from the stalinist north .
activists said the accident was unlikely to spark complaints .
there have been regular protests against the laws governing their presence since a us court martial last year acquitted two us soldiers over another road accident .
in that incident , two teenage south korean girls were killed by a us armoured vehicle .
the vehicle 's driver and navigator were found not guilty of negligent homicide .

chancellor gerhard schroeder made his remarks at a public meeting of his spd party , shortly after us president george bush told iraq that time was running out . "
do n't expect germany to approve a resolution which would give legitimacy to war " chancellor schroeder there has been rising resistance to war from france - a permanent member of the un security council - and other allies , many of whom want un weapons inspectors in iraq to have more time to do their work .
germany , which does not wield a veto in the security council , has left itself the option of abstaining from a future vote .
but , as the bbc 's un correspondent greg barrow points out , it still works out as one vote less in favour of war .
un security council china , france , russia , uk , us have veto 10 other members nine votes needed for military action germany assumes presidency 1 feb the us may conclude that it does not have enough support within the security council to guarantee the nine votes needed to pass a resolution authorising military action , he says .
earlier , turkey - a key nato partner - expressed its own fresh reservations , and announced that representatives of syria , egypt , saudi arabia , iran and jordan will meet in istanbul on thursday to try to find a way to prevent war in the region .
the remarks were made as two more us aircraft carriers were ordered to the gulf region for a possible attack on iraq .
more time britain , mr bush 's closest ally on the issue of iraq , is sending foreign secretary jack straw to washington on wednesday for talks with us secretary of state colin powell .

french foreign minister dominique de villepin - whose country is one of the five veto-wielding members of the security council - has already said that nothing so far justified military action and he did not rule out a french veto .
china and russia , also permanent members , say the inspectors should be given more time .
one of the leaders of the un inspection teams for iraq , mohamad elbaradei , has said the teams are only half way through their work .
he said both he and chief inspector hans blix would make this clear to the security council next week .

as well as their aircraft , the carriers usually operate with a battle group of escorting ships and submarines that also carry cruise missiles .
the bbc 's nick childs , at the pentagon , says the ships could operate in the gulf , the mediterranean , or the red sea , and thus be able to attack iraqi targets from a wide variety of directions .
the us had already announced it was to send nearly 37,000 personnel to the gulf in addition to the 62,000 troops ordered to mobilise earlier this month .

approximately half of the population are christians .
president marc ravalomanana is himself the vice president of the protestant reform movement known here as fjkm .
journalist and commentator jean-eric rakotorisoa says that without the support of the church , ravalomanana would not have become president .
church leaders are often consulted by the president pierre ranjeva , former diplomat " religion played a big role , notably the christian churches - catholic , anglican , reformist and lutheran .
they allowed marc ravalomanana to take power and get the support of the people .
" the church allowed him to resolve the political crisis here and become president .
so these churches had an enormous influence .
" ravalomanana is the vice president of the fjkm and he played on religion in order to get elected . "
ravalomanana 's party easily won the last elections president ravalomanana certainly takes christianity seriously and he expects the thousands of people who work for him in his private companies to do the same .
they have to attend regular services and hold prayer meetings before they start work .
his company trucks all have the number seven on them - a holy number in christian theology .
he also used a quotation from the bible - mark 5 , chapter 36 - as a political slogan : " do n't be afraid , just have faith . "
blurring of boundaries in the former catholic monastery of st joseph on the outskirts of town i met father remy ralibera .
he is the general secretary of the ecumenical movement of the all the major churches in madagascar - the ffkm .
this is the first time the country has a president who is not a catholic so is he worried that power has moved from the catholic to the protestant church ?
" the power is not with protestants but with marc ravalomanana , who is a protestant .
that has not influenced the life of the nation directly .
" i am a roman catholic priest but for me there is no problem with a president who is protestant , no problem . "
some commentators and critics though are concerned that there has been a blurring of the boundaries between church and state .
religion has always been tied up with politics in madagascar they say the first article of madagascar 's constitution talks of the secularity of government .
so has this independence been lost ?
pierre ranjeva is the former malagasy ambassador to brussels .
he thinks that because there was no real opposition in the last elections - the former ruling party arema boycotted the polls - there are no real political entities and that leaves a vacuum that the church is happy to fill .
" as there are not any political parties , the only organised institutions are the churches .
it can not be disputed that the president used the power and structure of the church .
" i have not done a sociological survey of the current government but i think that to be a christian would be an enormous advantage , because it is thought that the church leaders are often consulted by the president .
" it worries me .
where is the secularity of the state that is supposed to be a guarantee for democracy and diversity of opinion ? "
the church , for its part , seems to be listening .
the ecumenical movement , the ffkm , has just held its annual conference and it called for the independence and clear separation between politics and religion in madagascar .

the nation 's transport ministry is running pilot projects to find out if signals sent from drivers ' mobile phones to base stations can be used to time trips along popular routes .
the signals will help the transport ministry work out where traffic jams are building up and warn drivers of impending delays .
using mobile phones could be a cheap way of gathering useful information because the phone network already covers the entire country .
mobile monitor everyone knows that the finns are mad about mobile phones , about 80 % of the country 's inhabitants have a handset .
now finnra , the finnish road administration , is developing a way to use the mobile phones of drivers to spot traffic congestion .
every handset regularly swaps information with the base stations that make up a mobile network .
this ensures that the mobile network knows where a handset is so any calls or text messages can be are routed to it and to help manage voice traffic on the mobile network .
bad weather makes reading registration numbers tricky a mobile phone in a car , even if its owner is not using it , will check in with a series of base stations during the course of a trip .
by monitoring which phones talk to which base station and how long it takes the phone to reach the catchment area of a new base station it is possible to work out how long a trip is taking .
longer travel times means traffic is getting heavier .
by monitoring only 5 % of mobile phones , finnra believes it will be able to update information about changing traffic patterns every 30 seconds .
finnra is working with finnish mobile phone firm radiolinja on the trials .
in november 2002 trials were carried out along the stretch of finland 's highway 4 that runs between heinola and lahti as well as on the ring road around the capital helsinki .
according to a report prepared for finnra the trials showed that mobile phone signals are a very reliable source of information about traffic on finland 's roads .
information gathered can be piped to roadside signs or fed to radio stations to warn drivers about conditions on the roads .
the report said that phones are more reliable than the number plate recognition systems currently used to measure travel times because recognition systems perform badly when plates are obscured by bad weather .
now finnra is considering spending up to 7m euro to extend the trial system to all of finland 's roads .
using the mobile network would be much cheaper , and reliable , than extending number plate reading systems across the country .
the organisation is avoiding infringing the privacy of drivers by discarding data once it is used and by using codes that camouflage exactly which mobile phone is being used to time trips .

the nation 's transport ministry is running pilot projects to find out if signals sent from drivers ' mobile phones to base stations can be used to time trips along popular routes .
the signals will help the transport ministry work out where traffic jams are building up and warn drivers of impending delays .
using mobile phones could be a cheap way of gathering useful information because the phone network already covers the entire country .
mobile monitor everyone knows that the finns are mad about mobile phones , about 80 % of the country 's inhabitants have a handset .
now finnra , the finnish road administration , is developing a way to use the mobile phones of drivers to spot traffic congestion .
every handset regularly swaps information with the base stations that make up a mobile network .
this ensures that the mobile network knows where a handset is so any calls or text messages can be are routed to it and to help manage voice traffic on the mobile network .
a mobile phone in a car , even if its owner is not using it , will check in with a series of base stations during the course of a trip .
by monitoring which phones talk to which base station and how long it takes the phone to reach the catchment area of a new base station it is possible to work out how long a trip is taking .
longer travel times means traffic is getting heavier .
by monitoring only 5 % of mobile phones , finnra believes it will be able to update information about changing traffic patterns every 30 seconds .
finnra is working with finnish mobile phone firm radiolinja on the trials .
in november 2002 trials were carried out along the stretch of finland 's highway 4 that runs between heinola and lahti as well as on the ring road around the capital helsinki .
according to a report prepared for finnra the trials showed that mobile phone signals are a very reliable source of information about traffic on finland 's roads .
information gathered can be piped to roadside signs or fed to radio stations to warn drivers about conditions on the roads .
the report said that phones are more reliable than the number plate recognition systems currently used to measure travel times because recognition systems perform badly when plates are obscured by bad weather .
now finnra is considering spending up to 7m euro to extend the trial system to all of finland 's roads .
using the mobile network would be much cheaper , and reliable , than extending number plate reading systems across the country .
the organisation is avoiding infringing the privacy of drivers by discarding data once it is used and by using codes that camouflage exactly which mobile phone is being used to time trips .

apart , that is , for companies involved with linux , the open source operating system .
many firms that sell software and services based around the free operating system are doing good business and many large firms and governments are eagerly adopting the software .
even microsoft , traditionally the arch-enemy of open source advocates , has started espousing some of the philosophy that drives the movement .
manhattan transfer linux is the creation of finn linus torvalds , who built the free software around work done by the free software foundation and the venerable , and powerful , unix operating system .
the source code of linux is open to anyone to scrutinise and tinker with .
this has meant that linux is more secure and reliable than operating systems from firms such as microsoft .
this week , new york is hosting the linuxworld conference and expo , an event which gives an insight into the state of open source software and reveals that it is regarding the future with more confidence than most .
hewlett-packard recently announced that its linux-related business now amounts to sales of more than $ 2bn per year .
stars from hit tv show the sopranos will attend a party to celebrate hp 's success with linux .
open source software is also rapidly finding favour with many governments and public bodies as its lack of licence fees , reliability and freedom to tinker proves a powerful draw .
this week the south african government declared itself an open source advocate .
strong future market research firms also predict a bright future for open source software .
the meta group predicts that 45 % of servers will be running linux by 2007 at the latest .
similarly , analysts gartner expects to see shipments of linux server software to double in 2003 and generate £ 4bn in sales .
the companies trying to build businesses around the linux operating system are also stepping up efforts , called united linux , to create standard editions of the software and to ensure skills are transferable across its different varieties .
the news is not all good with some firms , such as mandrake , experiencing financial problems as they struggle to find ways of making free software pay .
many firms are working to use linux behind software , such as lotus notes , that has traditionally run on microsoft 's windows operating system .
again the reliability , security and low cost of linux is proving popular when technology budgets are being squeezed .
even microsoft has adopted something of the approach of the open source movement by pledging to governments to give them sight of windows ' source code .
microsoft critics see this as simply as a tactic designed to dent the success of open source software as a whole and shows how successful the movement has become .

thirty nine assembly members backed the motion tabled by four ams while 10 members voted against it in a free vote .

he said : " this debate is about protecting the health of welsh children and the majority of adults in wales who choose not to smoke .
" because the evidence is clear - passive smoking kills . "
mr pugh spoke of his particular concern that smoking should be banned in places where children are exposed to smoke .

mr davies told dai lloyd : " i think at your last party conference your party voted to legalise brothels .

the groups say their protest marks their struggle against " indian occupation " .
genuine and lasting peace in our region can be possible only when we have freedom and independence rebel statement but one of the most powerful rebel groups in the region , representing the naga people , has not joined in the protest .
senior naga leaders are currently engaged in landmark peace talks with the indian government in delhi .
on sunday india will celebrate 53 years of becoming a sovereign republic .
the day is traditionally marked with colourful parades and pageants , as well as being used to illustrate india 's military might .
but separatist rebels in the north-east say the day symbolises their " colonial bondage " under indian " occupation " .
" it is therefore in the interests of the entire people of the region that republic day be boycotted as a symbolic rejection of india 's constitution , " a statement circulated by the groups said .
" genuine and lasting peace in our region can be possible only when we have freedom and independence . "
nagaland but one of the most powerful groups in the north-east , the nationalist socialist council of nagaland -lrb- nscn -rrb- is not part of the boycott .
while a breakaway faction of the nscn is observing a ceasefire , the main faction is holding talks with indian government officials in delhi .
earlier this week , its leaders said the group would not target indian security forces in the future .
the climb-down has raised hopes of a settlement of one of the longest running insurgencies in the country , which began soon after independence in 1947 .
violence indian officials say security has been stepped up throughout the north-east in anticipation of increased attacks in the run-up to republic day .
on wednesday , the outlawed united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- said it had killed 15 indian soldiers in an attack on an army outpost in the district of tinsukia .
a military spokesman confirmed the attack but said there were no casualties .
earlier this week rebels blew up a rail track in assam , derailing four coaches of a passenger train .

the groups say their protest marks their struggle against " indian occupation " . "
genuine and lasting peace in our region can be possible only when we have freedom and independence " rebel statement but one of the most powerful rebel groups in the region , representing the naga people , has not joined in the protest .
senior naga leaders are currently engaged in landmark peace talks with the indian government in delhi .
on sunday india will celebrate 53 years of becoming a sovereign republic .
the day is traditionally marked with colourful parades and pageants , as well as being used to illustrate india 's military might .
but separatist rebels in the north-east say the day symbolises their " colonial bondage " under indian " occupation " .
" it is therefore in the interests of the entire people of the region that republic day be boycotted as a symbolic rejection of india 's constitution , " a statement circulated by the groups said .
" genuine and lasting peace in our region can be possible only when we have freedom and independence . "
nagaland but one of the most powerful groups in the north-east , the nationalist socialist council of nagaland -lrb- nscn -rrb- is not part of the boycott .
while a breakaway faction of the nscn is observing a ceasefire , the main faction is holding talks with indian government officials in delhi .
earlier this week , its leaders said the group would not target indian security forces in the future .
the climb-down has raised hopes of a settlement of one of the longest running insurgencies in the country , which began soon after independence in 1947 .
violence indian officials say security has been stepped up throughout the north-east in anticipation of increased attacks in the run-up to republic day .
on wednesday , the outlawed united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- said it had killed 15 indian soldiers in an attack on an army outpost in the district of tinsukia .
a military spokesman confirmed the attack but said there were no casualties .
earlier this week rebels blew up a rail track in assam , derailing four coaches of a passenger train .
no one was hurt in the attack .
